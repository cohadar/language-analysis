Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of November, 2001, contributions are being solicited from people

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer 
to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING 
about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm 
etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States 
copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

Vorwort zur deutschen Ausgabe

Unsere Welt ist in Unordnung geraten.  Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist eine
grosse Belastung fuer alle.  Sozialleistungen werden weiter drastisch
gekuerzt.  Das Universitaetssystem befindet sich im Umbruch.  Politik,
Wirtschaft und Arbeitswelt durchlaufen Veraenderungen, die sich nicht
nach dem gewohnten ordentlichen Muster des sogenannten Fortschritts
richten.  Gleichwohl verfolgen Politiker aller Couleur politische
Programme, die mit den eigentlichen Problemen und Herausforderungen
in Deutschland (und in Europa) nicht das Geringste zu tun haben.  Das
vorliegende Buch moechte sich diesen Herausforderungen widmen, aus
einer Perspektive, die die Zwangslaeufigkeit dieser Entwicklung betont.

Wenn man eine Hypothese vorstellt, benoetigt man ein geeignetes
Prueffeld.  In meinen Augen ist Deutschland am besten dafuer geeignet.
In keinem anderen Land der Welt laesst sich die Dramatik des Umbruchs
so unmittelbar verfolgen wie hier.  In Deutschland treffen die Kraefte
und Werte, die zu den grossen historischen Errungenschaften und den
katastrophalen historischen Fehlleistungen dieses Landes gefuehrt
haben, mit den neuen Kraeften und Werten, die das Gesicht der Welt
veraendern, gewissermassen in Reinform zusammen.

An Ordnung, Disziplin und Fortschritt gewoehnt, beklagen die Buerger
heute eine allgegenwaertige laehmende Buerokratie, die von Regierung und
Verwaltung ausgeht.  Frueher galt das, verbunden mit dem Namen
Bismarcks, als gute deutsche Tugend, eine der vielen
Qualitaetsmaschinen „Made in Germany“.  Im Verlauf der Zeit aber wurde
der Buerger abhaengig von ihr und konnte sich nicht vorstellen, jemals
ohne sie auszukommen.  Die Mehrheit schreckt vor Alternativen zurueck
und moechte nicht einmal ueber sie nachdenken.  Gepraegt von Technik und
Qualitaetsarbeit ist die Vorstellung, dass das Industriezeitalter
seinem Ende entgegengeht, den meisten eine Schreckensvision.  Sie
wuerden eher ihre Schrebergaerten hergeben als die digitale Autobahn zu
akzeptieren, die doch die Staus auf ihren richtigen Autobahnen zu den
Hauptverkehrszeiten abbauen koennte--ich betone das „koennte“.  Noch
immer lebt es sich gut durch den Export eines technischen und
wissenschaftlichen Know-how, dessen Glanzzeit allerdings vorueber ist.

Als ein hochzivilisiertes Land ist Deutschland fest entschlossen, den
barbarischen Teil seiner Vergangenheit hinter sich zu lassen.  Der
Klarheit halber sei gesagt, was ich unter barbarisch verstehe:
Hitler-Deutschland verdient keinen anderen Namen, ebensowenig wie
alle anderen AEusserungen von Aggression, Antisemitismus und Rassismus,
die noch immer nicht der Vergangenheit angehoeren.  Aber bis heute hat
man nicht verstanden, dass eben jene pragmatische Struktur, die die
industrielle Kraft Deutschlands begruendete, auch die destruktiven
Kraefte beguenstigte.  (Man denke nur an die Technologieexporte, die
die wahnsinnigen Fuehrer oelreicher Laender erst juengst in die Haende
bekommen haben.) Das wiedervereinigte Deutschland ist bereit, in
einer Welt mit globalen Aufgaben und globalen Problemen Verantwortung
zu uebernehmen.  Es setzt sich unter anderem fuer den Schutz des
tropischen Regenwaldes ein und zahlt fuer Werte--den Schutz der
Umwelt--statt fuer Produkte.  Aber die politischen Fuehrer Deutschlands
und mit ihnen grosse Teile der Bevoelkerung haben noch nicht begriffen,
dass der Osten des Landes nicht unbedingt ein Duplikat des Westens
werden muss, damit beide Teile zusammenpassen.  Differenz, d. h.
Andersartigkeit, ist eine Qualitaet, die sich in Deutschland keiner
grossen Wertschaetzung erfreut.  Verlorene Chancen sind der Preis, den
Deutschland fuer diese preussische Tugend der Gleichmacherei bezahlen
muss.

Die englische Originalfassung dieses Buches wurde 1997 auf der
Leipziger Buchmesse vorgestellt und in der Folge von der Kritik
wohlwollend aufgenommen.  Dank der grosszuegigen Unterstuetzung durch
die Mittelsten-Scheid Stiftung Wuppertal und die Alfred und Claere
Pott Stiftung Essen, fuer die ich an dieser Stelle noch einmal Dank
sage, konnte dann Anfang 1998 die Realisierung des von Beginn an
bestehenden Plans einer deutschsprachigen Ausgabe konkret ins Auge
gefasst werden.  Und nachdem Prof. Dr. Norbert Greiner, bei dem ich
mich hier ebenfalls herzlich bedanken moechte, fuer die UEbersetzung
gewonnen war, konnte zuegig an die Erarbeitung einer gegenueber der
englischen Ausgabe deutlich komprimierten und staerker auf den
deutschsprachigen Diskussionskontext zugeschnittenen deutschen
Ausgabe gegangen werden.  Einige Kapitel der Originalausgabe sind in
der deutschsprachigen Edition entfallen, andere wurden stark
ueberarbeitet.  Entfallen sind vor allem solche Kapitel, die sich in
ihren inhaltlichen Bezuegen einem deutschen Leser nicht unmittelbar
erschliessen wuerden.  Ein Nachwort, das sich ausschliesslich an die
deutschen Leser wendet, wurde ergaenzt.

Die deutsche Fassung ist also eigentlich ein anderes Buch.  Wer das
Thema erweitern und vertiefen moechte, ist selbstverstaendich
eingeladen, auf die englische Version zurueckzugreifen, in die 15
Jahre intensiver Forschung, Beobachtung und Erfahrung mit der neuen
Technologie und der amerikanischen Kultur eingegangen sind.  Ein
Vorzug der kompakten deutschen Version liegt darin, dass die juengsten
Entwicklungen--die so schnell vergessen sein werden wie alle anderen
Tagesthemen--„Fortsetzungen“ meiner Argumente darstellen und sie
gewissermassen kommentieren.  Sie haben wenig miteinander zu tun und
sind dennoch in den folgenden Kapiteln antizipiert: Guildos Auftritt
beim Grand Prix d’Eurovision (liebt er uns eigentlich immer noch, und
warum ist das so wichtig?), die enttaeuschende Leistung der deutschen
Nationalmannschaft bei der Fussballweltmeisterschaft (standen sich im
Endspiel Brasilien und Frankreich oder Nike und Adidas gegenueber?),
die Asienkrise, das Ergebnis der Bundestagswahlen, der Euro, neue
Entwicklungen in Wissenschaft und Technologie, die juengsten
Arbeitslosenzahlen, die OEkosteuer und vieles mehr.  Wer sich der Muehe
einer gruendlichen Lektuere des vorliegenden Buches unterzieht, wird
sich auf diese Entwicklungen einen eigenen Reim machen koennen, sehr
viel besser als die Mediengurus, die uns das Denken abnehmen wollen.
Zumindest wird er ueber die wortreichen Artikel halbgebildeter
Akademiker und opportunistischer Journalisten schmunzeln, die allzeit
bereit sind, anderen zu erklaeren, was sie selbst nicht verstehen.

Wie in der englischen Version moechte ich auch meine deutschen Leser
einladen, mit mir in Kontakt zu treten und mir ihre kritischen
Kommentare oder Fragen per e-mail zukommen zu lassen: nadin@acm.org.
Im Einklang mit dem Ziel des Buches, fuer die Kommunikation jenseits

Kapitel 1:

Die interaktive Zukunft: Der Einzelne, die Gemeinschaft und die
Gesellschaft im Zeitalter des Internets

Zusammenbruch und Katastrophe gegenueber Hoffnung und ungeahnten
Moeglichkeiten--dies sind die extremen Positionen in der hitzigen
Debatte um die Dynamik des weltweit sich vollziehenden Umbruchs.
Paul Virilio spricht vom Ende der Schrift in einem Zeitalter des
Fernsehens und der Bildverarbeitung und sagt das Ende des Sprechens
voraus--das Schweigen der Laemmer.  AEhnlich weitreichende, aber
optimistischere AEusserungen kommen von denjenigen, die in den von der
Schriftkultur losgeloesten Interaktionen eine Chance fuer soziale
Erneuerung sehen.  Das elektronische Forum der Europaeischen
Kommission, das sich mit dem Projekt Informationsgesellschaft
beschaeftigt, hat eine Liste mit Zehn Kernpunkten aufgestellt, von
denen einer die radikale Reformierung des Kommunikations- und
Bildungssystems fordert.

Beide Positionen sind auf ihre Weise intolerant.

Waehrend in der oeffentlichen Diskussion immer wieder neue, wichtige
Aspekte des fuer diese Zeit der Diskontinuitaeten charakteristischen
Konflikts auftauchen, konstituieren sich Milliarden von Menschen auf
unserem Planeten durch eine breite Vielfalt praktischer Erfahrungen.
Wir haben sie in den vorausgegangenen Kapiteln eingehend behandelt.
Angesichts dieses breiten pragmatischen Spektrums ist es fast
unmoeglich, die Zukunft der virtuellen Gemeinschaften oder der
elektronischen Demokratie auszumalen, ohne naiv oder nachgerade dumm
zu erscheinen.  Wir wissen, wie weit wir gekommen sind, aber wir
wissen nicht genau, wo wir stehen.

Da ich eine umfassendere pragmatische Perspektive anstrebe, waehle ich
einen Ansatz, der ueber die aktuellen kurzatmigen Argumentationen
hinausgeht.  Eine These dieses Buch besteht ja darin, dass sich
Loesungen nicht aus euphorischer Technologieverherrlichung, aus
kultureller Selbstreplikation, aus auf biologischen Mechanismen
beruhenden Modellen, aus unfokussierten bionomischen UEberlegungen
oder starrsinniger Kapitalismuskritik ergeben werden.  Positive
Loesungsansaetze, die ueber die Rhetorik intellektueller Kontroversen
und politischer Diskussionen hinausgehen, muessen sich aus den
positiven Handlungen ergeben, die unsere Identitaet als Individuum,
Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft formen.  Die Metapher der interaktiven
Zukunft drueckt eine einfache These aus: Innerhalb der globalen Skala
ist menschliche Interaktion, als konkreter Ausdruck der Einbindung
unendlich vielfaeltiger kognitiver Ressourcen, die letzte verfuegbare
Ressource, von der die Zukunft unserer Gattung abhaengen koennte.


Das UEberwinden der Schriftkultur

Das UEberwinden der Schriftkultur geschieht in der Praxis eines
hocheffizienten Pragmatismus, der der globalen Skala des Menschen
entspricht.  Diese Skala erfasst die Bildung menschlicher
Gemeinschaften und die Interaktionen zwischen dem Einzelnen und der
Gemeinschaft.  Wie schon erwaehnt, haben Beduinen in der Sahara und
Indianer in den Anden genauso Zugang zum Fernsehen, wie die Menschen
in hochtechnologisierten Industrienationen.  Die Identitaet von
Bevoelkerungsgruppen in weniger entwickelten Gesellschaften ist auf
der globalen Landkarte wirtschaftlicher und politischer
Verflechtungen bereits zum Zielobjekt hochentwickelter
Verarbeitungssysteme geworden.  In den Buechern der Weltwirtschaft ist
ihre Existenz im Hinblick auf ihre Leistungsfaehigkeit, ihre
Beduerfnisse und ihre Kaufkraft genau verzeichnet.  Menschen, die im
Silicon Valley, in Frankreich, Japan, Israel oder an einem anderen
Ort dieses Planeten virtuelle Gemeinschaften bilden, werden mit Hilfe
unterschiedlichster Methoden Gegenstand globaler Integration.

Die Ausweitung nicht-schriftgebundener Erfahrungen der
Selbstkonstituierung gibt berechtigten Anlass zur Frage nach dem
sozialen Status des Individuums und der Natur der Beziehungen und
Abhaengigkeiten in einer Gesellschaft.  Kinder werden beispielsweise
staerker mit Bildern konfrontiert als mit Sprache.  Sie neigen dazu,
Zeit als einen staendigen Jetzt-Zustand wahrzunehmen, und sie erwarten,
dass Befriedigung, so wie sie es im Fernsehen erleben, augenblicklich
eintritt und dass sie so leicht zu erlangen ist wie der Zugang zu
einer spannenden Seite im Internet.  Sie werden zu Experten fuer
interaktive Spiele und fuer die Kontrolle extrem schneller Prozesse.
Losgeloest von Kultur und Tradition, sind sie besonders
anpassungsfaehig an neue Situationen und bestrebt, eine eigene Form
der Unabhaengigkeit zu finden.  Sex, Drogen, Rap-Musik, Zugehoerigkeit
zu Sekten oder Gangs sind Teil ihres widerspruechlichen Profils.
Diese Jugendlichen sind die Piloten in den Nintendo-Kriegen, aber
auch die zukuenftigen Entdecker des Kosmos, die Physiker, Biologen und
Gentechniker, die neue Materialien gestalten und Maschinen von
atemberaubender Komplexitaet erfinden, bei denen jedes Millionstel
einer Sekunde das Ergebnis beeinflusst.  Sie sind die Kuenstler und
rekordhungrigen Sportler von morgen; sie sind die Programmierer und
Designer der Zukunft.  Sie werden Dienstleistungen in einem
Wirtschaftssystem bereitstellen, das durch seinen schnellen
Wandel--wegen der staendig wachsenden Nachfrage nach Ressourcen--nicht
mehr mit den traegen und wenig flexiblen Mitteln der Schriftkultur
betrieben wird.

Daten belegen, dass diese Individuen weniger am Leben in der
Gemeinschaft interessiert und weniger an ethische Grundsaetze der
Vergangenheit gebunden sind.  Moralische Absolutismen und Anteilnahme
spielen keine grosse Rolle in diesem Leben, das gepraegt ist durch
praktische Erfahrungen, die zur Selbstaendigkeit, oft verwechselt mit
Unabhaengigkeit, fuehren sollen.  Angesichts all dieser Entwicklungen
draengt sich die Frage auf, welche Form die Beziehung zwischen
Gemeinschaft und hocheffizienten Individuen, die sich in der Regel in
Abkapselung von den anderen entfalten, annehmen wird.  Welchen Status
wird die Gemeinschaft bekommen?

Heutzutage klagen viele Buerger und Organisationen ueber die geringe
Lebensqualitaet in den urbanen Zentren (in den USA und ueberall auf der
Welt), hohe Arbeitslosigkeit und ein Gefuehl der Randexistenz.
Einwanderer in vielen verschiedenen Gastlaendern, Gastarbeiter in der
Europaeischen Union, junge Menschen in Asien, Afrika und den
ehemaligen Ostblockstaaten, Minderheiten in den USA, Arbeitslose auf
der ganzen Welt--jede dieser Gruppen steht vor Problemen, die sich
aus ihrer Andersartigkeit ergeben.  Einwanderer sind nicht immer
willkommen, und wenn sie aufgenommen werden, wird von ihnen erwartet,
dass sie sich anpassen.  Gastarbeiter muessen Arbeiten verrichten, an
denen sich die Buerger des Gastlandes nicht die Finger schmutzig
machen moechten.  Die junge Menschen sollen nach Moeglichkeit in die
Fussstapfen ihrer Eltern treten.  Die Empfaenger von Sozialhilfe sollen
sich diese verdienen und jeden angebotenen Arbeitsplatz annehmen.
Schriftlichkeit impliziert Erwartungen von Homogenitaet.  Einwanderer
mussten und muessen heute noch die Sprache des jeweiligen Gastlandes
erlernen, um ganz normale Buerger zu werden.  Von Gastarbeitern,
definiert durch ihre Funktion auf dem Arbeitsmarkt, erwartet man eine
reibungslose Rueckkehr in ihr Heimatland.  Jugendliche wurden durch
ein einheitliches Bildungssystem geschleust, und Arbeitslose sollten
nach einer kurzen Phase der Umschulung von der Maschine
Volkswirtschaft wieder geschluckt werden.

Historisch hat sich das Phaenomen Gemeinschaft folgendermassen
entwickelt: Individuen nehmen "lockere" Beziehungen zum herrschenden
Adel auf.  Im naechsten Schritt werden individuelle
UEberlebensgemeinschaften gebildet.  Es folgt die UEbertragung
individueller Eigenschaften (Selbstbestimmung, Entscheidungsfreiheit)
auf die Gemeinschaft, und schliesslich kommt es zur Aufgabenteilung,
zur Dezentralisation.  Jeder Schritt ist durch das Ausmass der
optimalen Leistung des Individuums definiert: von sehr hoher
individueller Leistungsfaehigkeit als Voraussetzung fuer das UEberleben
zu geteilten Verantwortungsbereichen bis hin zur UEbertragung der
individuellen Verantwortung auf die Gesellschaft.  Die liberale
Demokratie zelebriert das Paradoxon eines sozialisierten
Individualismus.  In dieser Hinsicht beendet dies die Zeit
politischer Kaempfe (und auch der Geschichte, wie man uns weismachen
will), und laeutet die Zeit des Wohlstands ein.  Die kommerzielle
Demokratie ist weder das Ergebnis politischen Handelns, noch ist sie
Ausdruck einer Ideologie.  Innerhalb ihres Bereiches sind die Grenzen
zwischen Individuum und einer aus dem Gleichgewicht gebrachten
Gemeinschaft ein staendiger Konfliktherd.  Moralischer Individualismus
siegt oder verliert in einer Welt feindlicher menschlicher
Beziehungen.  Da moralischer Individualismus den Liberalismus
sozusagen untermauert--"Sei dir selbst der Naechste"--ist die vom
Liberalismus angestrebte Freiheit eine Freiheit des Wettbewerbs um
den Zugang zum Wohlstand.  Sozialisierter Individualismus akzeptiert
den Staat nur als Lieferanten von Rechten und Moeglichkeiten (sofern
der Hegelsche Gedanke von der Prioritaet des Staates vor dem
Individuum de facto akzeptiert wird), nicht aber als moralische
Instanz.

Definitorisch fuer diese Prozesse ist der UEbergang zu einer
Lebenspraxis, in der angesichts zahlreicher Koordinierungsmechanismen
individuelle Leistung marginal wird.  Die relative Bedeutung von
Funktionsstoerungen--Zusammenbrueche des Rechts- und Sozialsystems
etwa--als Momente der Selbsterkenntnis und des Neuanfangs, die durch
die Notwendigkeit einer UEberholung veralteter Praktiken ausgeloest
werden, ist in jedem der erwaehnten Stadien eine andere.

Gleiches gilt fuer die Chance des Wandels und der Erneuerung.
Kreativitaet ist in der heutigen Praxis weniger eine Angelegenheit des
einzelnen als das Ergebnis orchestrierter Bemuehungen innerhalb eines
grossen Interaktionsnetzes.  Die zugrundeliegende Struktur einer
Kultur jenseits der Schriftkultur unterstuetzt eine Praxis, die durch
Heterogenitaet, verteilte Aufgaben und Vernetzung gekennzeichnet ist.
Die Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen erzeugt nicht mehr Uniformitaet,
sondern Mannigfaltigkeit.  Dauerhaftigkeit, stabile Hierarchien und
Zentralismus sind irrelevant geworden.  Wir stehen vor neuen
Problemen.  Ihre schriftkulturelle Formulierung waere irrefuehrend; die
Herausforderung, die sie im neuen Kontext der Schriftlosigkeit
darstellen, ist von bislang unbekannter Groesse.  Deshalb muessen wir
uns damit befassen.


Das Sein in der Sprache

Die zwei Aspekte der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung durch
Sprache--Individuum und Gemeinschaft (Gesellschaft)--ergeben sich aus
der Grundfrage nach den sozialen Beziehungen.  Die Sprache des
Einzelnen existiert nicht unabhaengig von der Sprache der Gesellschaft,
obwohl sich innerhalb einer Gesellschaft Menschen durch
offensichtliche Besonderheiten in Sprache, Schrift, Lektuere und
Gespraechsverhalten identifizieren.  Die biologische Struktur des
Menschen beinhaltet Elemente, die sprachrelevant sind.  Sprache
entwickelt sich jedoch nicht von innen heraus wie die Sinne, sondern
wird schrittweise erworben.  Ungeachtet des jeweiligen Stadiums des
Spracherwerbs dominiert die Sprache die Sinne.  Das menschliche Wesen
projiziert sich durch Sprache in die Kultur, die es selbst
kontinuierlich veraendert und innerhalb welcher sie sich gegenseitig
identifizieren.  Natur und Sprache bilden eine immer wechselnde
Einheit.

Waehrend die Natur ein relativ stabiles Bezugssystem ist, veraendert
sich die Kultur mit den Menschen.  In einer Sprache zu sein, wie es
alle Menschen sind, und in einer Gemeinschaft zu sein, bedeutet, am
Prozess individueller Integration und sozialer Koordination
teilzuhaben.  Individueller Sprachgebrauch und Sprachgebrauch der
Gesellschaft sind nicht identisch.  Individuen konstituieren sich
anders als Gemeinschaften.  Dass jede Gemeinschaft Merkmale aufweist,
die den diese Gemeinschaft konstituierenden Individuen gemeinsam sind,
besagt lediglich, dass die Summe individueller Sprachhandlungen sich
von der fuer die soziale Erfahrung charakteristischen Sprache
unterscheidet.  Der Unterschied zwischen der Sprache des Individuums
und der Sprache der Gemeinschaft zeigt soziale Beziehungen an.  Eine
allgemeinere These soll hier angefuehrt werden: Die Natur und die
Vielfalt menschlicher Interaktionen bei der Selbstkonstituierung
durch Sprache beschreiben die Komplexitaet des pragmatischen Rahmens.
Diese Interaktionen sind Teil des staendigen Identifikationsprozesses
des Einzelnen oder der Gruppe im Verlauf der Identitaetsfindung als
besondere Gattung.

Anerkannte Beziehungsformen im Rahmen von Arbeitsplatz, Familie,
Leben, Magie, Ritual, Mythos, Religion, Kunst, Wissenschaft oder
Bildung werden durch ihre jeweiligen Muster dargelegt.  Solche Muster,
umschrieben durch die Selbstkonstituierung im natuerlichen und
kulturellen Kontext, sind erst rueckwirkend von Bedeutung.  Sie
bezeugen das soziale Wesen des Menschen und zeigen, wo der kulturelle
Teil und der natuerliche Teil dieses Wesens liegen.  Aktive Teilhabe
von Individuen in der Praxis der Sprache bezeugt deren Beduerfnis,
ihre Identitaet in den erwaehnten Beziehungsmustern zu suchen.
Menschen treten nicht deshalb zueinander in Beziehung, weil das
jeweilige Gegenueber ein netter Mensch ist.  Der Bezug zum anderen ist
Teil einer staendigen Definition des Individuums in einem Kontext, der
von Konflikt und Kooperation und von der Anerkennung von
Unterschieden und AEhnlichkeiten gepraegt ist.  Jegliche Dynamik, ob in
der Biologie oder in der Kultur, ergibt sich aus Unterschieden.

Man sieht Sprache als naturgegeben an und stellt ihre Konventionen
nie in Frage.  Als eine natuerliche, (nach Chomsky) vererbte
Eigenschaft wird Sprache nicht jedes Mal neu erfunden, wenn sich
Selbstkonstituierungen durch Sprache vollziehen.  Auch steht ihre
Nuetzlichkeit niemals in Frage, wenn wir ihre Grenzen zu spueren
bekommen.  Das Versagen eines Werkzeugs--z. B. wenn es fuer eine
bestimmte Aufgabe ungeeignet ist--legt nahe, ein neues Werkzeug zu
entwickeln.  Das Versagen von Sprache hingegen deutet auf Grenzen der
menschlichen Erfahrung hin, nicht auf die des Werkzeugs.
Funktionsstoerungen der Sprache verweisen auf die biologische Anlage
und die Art und Weise, wie sie durch das menschliche Handeln auf die
Realitaet projiziert wird.  Dies gilt nicht fuer andere, weniger
natuerliche Zeichensysteme: Symbole, kuenstliche Sprachen,
Meta-Sprachen.

Was sich von einer Skala des Menschen zu einer anderen veraendert, ist
der Koeffizient der linearen Gleichung, nicht die Linearitaet als
solche.  Eine kleine Gruppe von Menschen kann durch Jagen, Sammeln
von Fruechten und Landbestellung ueberleben.  Die Anstrengungen, die
notwendig sind, um eine groessere Gruppe zu versorgen, wachsen
proportional zur Groesse der Gruppe.  In jenen Augenblicken der
Entwicklung, in denen eine kritische Masse, eine Schwelle erreicht
wurde (Spracherwerb, Landbewirtschaftung, Schrift, industrielle
Produktion und jetzt die post-industrielle Produktion), verursachten
die Effizienzerwartungen, die der jeweiligen Skala entsprachen,
Veraenderungen im pragmatischen Rahmen.  Das Bewusstsein eines
Versagens der Sprache entsteht durch Erfahrungen, die neue Sprachen
notwendig machen.

Fehlkommunikation ist dann gegeben, wenn die verwendete Sprache fuer
die praktische Erfahrung unpassend ist.  Ein Mangel an Kommunikation
zeigt die Grenzen der Menschen, die in eine bestimmte Taetigkeit
eingebunden sind.  Fehlkommunikation fuehrt dazu, dass Menschen (sich
und andere) fragen, was und warum etwas schief gelaufen ist und was
getan werden kann, um negative Folgen fuer die Effektivitaet ihrer
Taetigkeit zu verhindern.  Andere Arten der Fehlfunktion von Sprache
koennen Menschen als Individuen oder als Mitglieder einer Gemeinschaft
auf einer anderen Ebene als der der Kommunikation betreffen: Das
Versagen von politischen Systemen, Ideologien, Religion(en), Maerkten,
von Ethik oder Familie drueckt sich im Zusammenbruch menschlicher
Beziehungsmuster aus.  Wir halten aber die Sprache dieser politischen
Systeme, Ideologien, Religionen und Maerkte selbst nach ihrem
Scheitern am Leben; nicht zufaellig oder aus Nachlaessigkeit, sondern
weil wir selber alle diese Sprachen sind--als Beteiligte an
politischen Prozessen, Objekte ideologischer Indoktrinierung,
Anhaenger einer Religion, Gueter eines Marktes, Familienmitglieder oder
aufrechte Buerger.  Die Ineffizienz dieser praktischen Erfahrungen
spiegelt unsere eigene Ineffizienz wider, die schwieriger zu
ueberwinden ist als eine Rechtschreibschwaeche, etymologische Ignoranz
oder phonetische Taubheit.


Die Mauer hinter der Mauer

Ein gutes Beispiel fuer die Solidaritaet zwischen Spracherfahrung und
dem sich durch Sprache konstituierenden Individuum liefert der
Zusammenbruch des osteuropaeischen Blocks, und pointierter noch der
Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion.  Niemand hatte damit gerechnet, dass
nach dem Fall der Berliner Mauer die Menschen im oestlichen Teil
Deutschlands in diesem System gefangen bleiben wuerden, obwohl sich
rechtliche, soziale und wirtschaftliche Umstaende veraenderten.  Trotz
der gemeinsamen Sprache blieben die Ostdeutschen Gefangene der
strukturellen Merkmale der alten Gesellschaft, die die Schriftkultur
ihnen aufgepraegt hatte: Zentralismus, klare Trennlinien,
Determinismus, hierarchische Strukturen, begrenzte (Wahl-) Freiheit.
Die unsichtbare, doch wirksame Konditionierung durch die ostdeutsche
Bildung--derjenigen Westdeutschlands kategorisch ueberlegen--ist der
neuen, in Westdeutschland erreichten Pragmatik unangemessen und
erweist sich als Huerde fuer die Integration der Ostdeutschen in eine
dynamische Gesellschaft.  Die hocheffiziente Pragmatik--verbunden mit
hohen Erwartungen, die die tatsaechliche Leistung zu uebersteigen
scheinen--wurde den Ostdeutschen von der Regierung auf der anderen
Seite der Grenze, die es nie haette geben duerfen, aufoktroyiert.

In anderen Teilen der Welt sieht es aehnlich aus--in Korea, Ungarn,
Rumaenien, in der Tschechische Republik, in der Slowakei, in Polen,
Kroatien, Serbien usw., wo pragmatische Entwicklungen und soziale,
politische, wirtschaftliche, nationale und kulturelle Entwicklungen
vollkommen asynchron vor sich gehen.  Auf die grossen kulturellen und
wissenschaftlichen Leistungen des Ostblocks habe ich in anderem
Zusammenhang schon hingewiesen; auch darauf, dass die Staerke dieser
auf Schriftkultur basierenden Kulturen illusorisch und reine
Selbsttaeuschung war.

In nicht allzu entfernter Vergangenheit lasen die Menschen dieser
Laender Buecher, besuchten Konzerte, Opern und Museen.  Heute jagen sie,
wenn ihre Lebensumstaende es noch zulassen, mit der gleichen
Leidenschaft hinter den Dingen her, die frueher fuer sie unerreichbar
waren, auch wenn das einer Aufgabe ihrer geistigen Errungenschaften
gleichkommt.  Die neue Sprache ist die Sprache des Konsums.  Die alte
Beziehung zwischen der Sprache des Einzelnen und der Sprache der
Gesellschaft wies Merkmale von Taeuschung oder Feigheit auf.  Die neue
Beziehung zeigt Erwartungsstrukturen, die die erreichte Effizienz
weit uebersteigen.  Die Mauer hinter der Mauer zeigt sich in den sehr
resistenten Mustern der Interaktion, die aus einer schriftkulturellen
Praxis erwachsen sind.  Angesichts dieses Beispiels muessen wir fragen,
ob es Alternativen gibt zu den Ausdrucksmitteln, die die Menschen
verwenden, und zu dem sozialen Programm, dem sie sich verpflichtet
haben.


Die Botschaft ist das Medium

Sprache ist eine Form des sozialen Gedaechtnisses.  Wenn wir etwas
sagen oder jemandem zuhoeren, gehen wir von einem einheitlichen
Gebrauch der Woerter und der uebergeordneten linguistischen Einheiten
aus.  Als gespeichertes Zeugnis aehnlicher praktischer Erfahrungen
wurde die Sprache, stabilisiert in der Schrift, zum Medium, das sie
auf einen gemeinsamen Durchschnitt anglich.

Die in Sprache gefassten menschlichen Beziehungsmuster machen den
Menschen rueckblickend die Bedeutung dieser Muster fuer die menschliche
Effizienz bewusst.  Es sieht also so aus, als wuerden wir uns ueber die
eigenen Betrachtungen unserer Interaktionsmuster konstituieren.
Diese Betrachtungen koennen wir Erkenntnis nennen, da wir einander
mittels Interaktion kennenlernen und durch Interaktion erfahren, wie,
durch was und wann unsere dringendsten und weniger dringenden
Beduerfnisse befriedigt werden.  Das Paradigma der Schriftkultur
behauptet, dass die Selbstkonstituierung in der Sprache stattfindet,
und zwar nur in der Sprache, schriftlich niedergelegt und anderen
durch Lektuere zugaenglich.  Tatsaechlich haben wir unser Wissen aus der
Praxis menschlicher Interaktion und dem auf Sprache basierenden
Informationsaustausch gewonnen.  Dieses Wissen praegte die politischen,
ideologischen, religioesen und wirtschaftlichen Erfahrungen, unsere
Bemuehungen zur staendigen Verbesserung der Technologien und die
Entwicklung der Wissenschaft.  Die Zukunftsdimension ist
Grundbestandteil des Lebens, und sie erfasst Sprache und Schriftkultur,
Arbeit und pragmatische Erwartungen.

Die Sprache verkoerpert, wie jede andere semiotische Praxis, Art und
Zustand des durch Sprache Konstituierten; dies gilt auch fuer die
Identitaet des Menschen.  Die Projektion biologischer und kultureller
Merkmale auf die Alltagswelt schafft Bezugselemente.  Die Faehigkeit
zu sehen, zu hoeren, zu riechen und Werkzeuge zu benutzen, wird durch
menschliche Interaktion bestaetigt.  Faehigkeiten und Leistung
unterscheiden sich stark.  Wenn es darum geht, gemeinsame Ziele zu
verfolgen, fallen Selbsteinschaetzung und die Einschaetzung durch
andere unterschiedlich aus.  Sprache vermittelt, folglich werden
Verpflichtungen Teil der Erfahrung.  Wenn diesen nicht Folge
geleistet wird, kann die Sprache zum Ersatzmedium fuer Konfrontation
werden.

Einigung und Konfrontation gehoeren zu den Beziehungsmustern, die die
Art der Beziehung zwischen der Sprache des einzelnen und der Sprache
der Gemeinschaft definiert.  Die Sozialisierung von Sprache fuehrt zu
paradoxen Situationen: die sich durch die Sprache konstituierenden
Menschen glauben, dass sich Konfrontationen nicht zwischen ihnen,
sondern zwischen ihren Sprachen abspielen.  Vor wenigen Jahren konnte
man hoeren, dass Russen und Amerikaner sich gegenseitig sehr schaetzten,
obwohl in den Sprachen der Politik und der Ideologien Konflikt
angelegt war.  Heute hoeren wir, dass das Verhaeltnis von Ossis und
Wessis emotional stark belastet ist (die einen gelten als faul, die
anderen als arrogant; die einen sind kultiviert, die anderen ignorant;
eine Seite ist ehrlich, die andere korrupt), obwohl sie (fast)
dieselbe Sprache sprechen.

Die neue Skala der Menschheit, in der auch Demokratie--die Macht des
Volkes--nicht mehr ueberzeugend funktioniert, wirft viele schwierige
Fragen auf: Was, wenn ueberhaupt irgend etwas, kann die Schriftkultur
ersetzten?  Was koennte die Demokratie ersetzten?  Wie befreien wir
uns aus dem eisernen Griff der Buerokratie?  Bevor wir eine Antwort
darauf versuchen, muss deutlich werden, dass die kulturelle Praxis der
Schriftlichkeit und die soziale Praxis der Demokratie ihren Hoehepunkt
ueberschritten haben.

Die Frage nach dem Verhaeltnis von Schriftkultur und Macht stellt sich
in einem post-schriftkulturellen Zeitalter neu, aber mit der alten
Dringlichkeit.  Nicht das, was ein Politiker sagt, ist wichtig,
sondern wie er es sagt.  Bilder, gute Regie, ein gutes Buehnenbild
oder der richtige Hintergrund werden selbst zur Botschaft.  Deswegen
ist die Feststellung: "Die Botschaft ist das Medium", keine
respektlose Umkehrung von McLuhans beruehmter Formel, sondern sie
verzeichnet die veraenderte Beziehung zwischen Sprache und Welt.  Die
Interaktionen in der vernetzten Welt verdeutlichen diese
Umformulierung noch besser.  Die neu definierte Beziehung zwischen
den vielen Sprachen unserer neuen Lebenspraxis und der Realitaet wird
durch die Mittel und Werte einer Kultur jenseits der Schriftkultur
wiedergegeben.

In der pompoesen Architektur von Mitterands Palast und in der
Monumentalitaet des "neuen" Berlin verwandelt sich die Botschaft der
Schriftkultur--in Hoehe von mehreren Milliarden Mark--zu Stein und
Moertel.  Im Zeitalter von Aufgabenteilung und Dezentralisierung liegt
die angemessene Alternative in der virtuellen Welt und in einer
verbesserten Infrastruktur fuer den Zugang zu Denken und Wissen.  "Die
Botschaft ist das Medium": das laesst sich auch uebersetzen in die
Forderung, die Vergangenheitsfixiertheit aufzugeben.  Das setzt
allerdings voraus, dass wir alternative Medien schaffen, die die
Position des Einzelnen staerken, und nicht jene Machtstrukturen, die
in der Vergangenheit wichtig waren, aber heute die Entfaltung der
Zukunft verhindern.


Von der Demokratie zur Medio-kratie

Demokratie ist ein Spielfeld fuer Erwartungen.  Die Menschen
konstituieren sich als Buerger einer Demokratie, indem sie in ihren
praktischen Erfahrungen Gleichheit, Freiheit und Selbstbestimmung
anerkennen.  Der Demokratiebegriff hat sich mit der Zeit veraendert.
In der Antike gab es die Gleichheit des demos und freie Buerger--keine
Frauen, keine Sklaven--hatten Stimmrecht.  Nach zahlreichen
Emanzipationen bezeichnete der Begriff Demokratie schliesslich die
Freiheit der Menschen, ihre Regierung zu waehlen.  Wie diese
Selbstverwaltung tatsaechlich funktioniert--durch direkte oder
indirekte Repraesentation, in Form von Regierungen, die auf der
Gewaltenteilung von Exekutive und Legislative basieren, oder durch
Monarchien--ist eine Frage der jeweiligen pragmatischen Einrichtungen.
Die Demokratie der Armut ist eine andere als die Demokratie des
Wohlstands.  Gleiches Recht auf Arbeit, Bildung, medizinische
Versorgung und Kunst und gleiches Recht auf Drogen, Mord,
Arbeitslosigkeit, geringen Bildungsstand und Krankheit sind sehr
verschiedene Dinge.  Eine Stadtratssitzung in Vermont oder in einem
Schweizer Kanton, wo das Leben ordentlich und effektiv geregelt ist,
unterscheidet sich von einer Staatsregierung in Laendern, in denen die
zentrale Macht jede Form der Selbstverwaltung unterdrueckt.

Demokratie ist eine unserer wesentlichen sozialen und politischen
Erfahrungen.  Die Macht der Mehrheit, ermittelt in Wahlen, ist nur
eine der moeglichen Ausdrucksformen.  Wenn aber nur ein kleiner Teil
der Bevoelkerung zur Wahl geht, ist nicht die Mehrheit repraesentiert.
Die demokratische Praxis beruht oft auf Taeuschung, und wir verstaerken
dies durch den schriftkulturellen politischen Diskurs.  Als ein
Erwartungsbereich, in dem sich schriftkulturell verankerte Hoffnungen
artikulieren, erlangt Demokratie nur eine Bedeutung, wenn damit eine
Partizipation an sozialen und politischen Erfahrungen einhergeht.
Wenn sich eine der beiden Groessen in dieser wichtigen
gesellschaftlichen Praxis verringert--etwa die Partizipation--,
verringert sich die Demokratie proportional.  Es gibt viele Gruende
fuer eine abnehmende Partizipation der Buerger.  In Laendern, in denen
ein funktionierendes demokratisches System durch demokratische
Demagogie ersetzt wurde, mobilisieren Veraenderungen, ob durch
Revolutionen, Aufstaende oder Reformen, zu Beginn fast die ganze
Bevoelkerung.  Wir koennen dies gerade in Osteuropa und in den
Republiken der ehemaligen Sowjetunion beobachten.  Nach der
anfaenglich fast ungetruebten Begeisterung fuer den Neuanfang, die zu
demokratischen Bedingungen fuehrte, nimmt jetzt die individuelle
Teilhabe an der Regierung wieder ab.  Wo liegen die Gruende fuer dieses
Phaenomen, das sich auch am abnehmenden Interesse fuer Religion, Kunst
und Solidaritaet aeussert?

Es gibt viele Antworten und noch mehr Hypothesen:
Ermuedungserscheinungen, Mangel an demokratischer Tradition, Egoismus,
das Bestreben, mit reichen Nationen gleichzuziehen.  In Wahrheit aber
liegen die Gruende im Konflikt zwischen den schriftkulturellen Werten
und den neuen Effizienzerwartungen, die sich aus der neuen Skala der
Menschen ergeben.  Die Effizienz, die sich aus einer Pragmatik ergibt,
die sich von den in der Schriftkultur reifizierten Strukturmerkmalen
emanzipiert hat, verwandelte Demokratie in eine kommerzielle
Demokratie.  Die Menschen koennen kaufen und verkaufen, was immer sie
wollen.  Ihre Gleichheit heisst gleicher Zugang zum Markt des
Wohlstands; Freiheit ist durch das von allen anerkannte Recht auf
UEberfluss besiegelt.  Demokratisierung, von der die Menschen glauben,
dass sie ueberall auf der Welt stattfindet, ist ein Prozess, der immer
neue Gruppen von Menschen einbindet, in eine Welt des Wohlstands, der
oberflaechlichen Unterhaltungskultur (einschliesslich des Sports) und
der Regierungen, die ein Recht auf Reichtum und Konsum garantieren.

Man koennte leicht ins Moralisieren verfallen.  Die Schriftkultur
traegt bestimmte Erwartungen an demokratische Institutionen heran.
Wie andere Institutionen, muessen auch sie sich dem Effizienztest
unterziehen.  Wenn die Institutionen diesen Test nicht bestehen,
bekraeftigen sie--in der Sprache der Demokratie--nicht mehr die
Demokratie als praktische Erfahrung des Volkes, sondern sich selbst
als Institution.  Buerokratien entstehen dadurch, dass die Demokratie
ihren sozialen und politischen Blickwinkel aufgibt und sich gleichsam
in ihre eigene Sprache verliebt, in der ihre Prinzipien formuliert
sind.

Die Medien werden in Form der Massenmedien zu einem eigenen Faktor in
der Formel der Macht.  Wird das Potential der neuen Ausdrucksmittel
voll ausgeschoepft--die Macht der Bilder, der direkte Zugang zu
Ereignissen, die Macht der Vernetzung, der kommunikativen Ressourcen,
neuer Technologien--dann spielen die Medien eine Doppelrolle als
Repraesentanten des Volkes und Repraesentanten der Macht.  Da ihr
eigener Praxisbereich die Darstellung ist, sind die Medien von der
Effizienz der Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen in produktiven
Taetigkeiten abhaengig.  Die Taetigkeit der Massenmedien folgt nicht
eigenen Zielen, sondern wird durch den Markt, der in ihnen verortet
ist, motiviert.  Folglich wird die Formel der Demokratie zur Formel
von Wettbewerb und wirtschaftlichem Erfolg.  Die Medien waehlen die
Ursachen und Persoenlichkeiten aus, die fuer den Prozess der
Demokratievermarktung geeignet erscheinen.  Demokratie steht nicht
mehr fuer Regierung und die damit verbundene Verantwortung, sondern
vielmehr fuer das Recht der Menschen zu kaufen; unter anderem, die
Regierung zu kaufen und den Luxus, die eigene Verantwortung an ihre
Institutionen zu uebertragen.

Medienkritik wird immer dann zur Lieblingsbeschaeftigung der Politiker,
wenn die Dinge nicht wie erwartet funktionieren.  Die OEffentlichkeit
beteiligt sich an solchen Auseinandersetzungen besonders in Zeiten
wirtschaftlicher Unsicherheit oder politischer Entwicklungen, die
ausser Kontrolle geraten (Kriege, gewalttaetige Massendemonstrationen,
Wahlen).  Die Kritik an den Medien bezeugt, dass deren Beteiligung an
der Macht gewachsen ist.  Die schriftkulturellen Methoden der
Hierarchiebildung werden durch neue Technologien verstaerkt, die jeden
Adressaten selbst in vollkommen uebersaettigten Kontexten der
Informationsverbreitung erreichen.

Informationsvermarktung, Feedbackstrategien, Massenmedien, soziales
Engineering, Psychologie und Veranstaltungsdesign bilden eine
merkwuerdig eklektische Praxis.  Ihr einen bestimmten Namen zu geben,
wie etwa Medio-kratie mag tendenzioes klingen.  Aber es trifft den
Kern.  Ihre Bemuehungen sind nicht darauf gerichtet, Exzellenz und
Qualitaet zu foerdern oder gesellschaftliche Gruppen davon zu
ueberzeugen, dass Demokratie Qualitaet garantiert und selbstverwaltende
Systeme vor Korruption schuetzt.  Vielmehr ist ihr daran gelegen,
glaubhaft zu vermitteln, dass Mediokritaet der Ausdruck von Gleichheit
ist, und dass mehr nicht zu erwarten ist, wenn die Menschen nicht
entschlossener von ihren Rechten Gebrauch machen.  Die Mittel, die
zur Verteidigung der Demokratie verwendet werden, und das gesamte
politische System, das auf ihren Grundsaetzen aufgebaut ist, machen
nur allzu deutlich, dass die Demokratie als ein Kind sprachgebundener
Praxis alles andere als die ewige und universelle Antwort oder der
Hoehepunkt der Geschichte ist.  Auch hier muessen alternative
Partizipationsformen gefunden werden, die der neuen Skala entsprechen.
Solche Alternativen muessen die entscheidenden neuen Faktoren
beinhalten: die verteilte Natur der Arbeit; ein besseres Verstaendnis
der Beziehung (oder fehlenden Beziehung) zwischen Individuum und
Gemeinschaft; das Bewusstsein von Veraenderung als einzig dauerhaftem
Zustand; und Strategien der Koevolution, die alle Menschen und die
Natur, deren Teil der Mensch immer noch ist, als gleich betrachten.
Demokratie ist das Produkt menschlicher Erfahrungen, die auf dem
Postulat des Gleichseins beruhen.  Alternativen entstehen durch die
Dynamik des Unterschieds.  Sobald die Gruenen eine Partei wie jede
andere werden, verschwimmt ihre Farbe.


Selbstorganisation

Zeit, Energie, Ausruestung und Verstand sind in die Erforschung des
kuenstlichen Lebens (ALife) investiert worden.  Das Wissen, das wir
aus dieser Forschung bezogen haben, kann zur Verbesserung von
Modellen fuer individuelles und gesellschaftliches Leben genutzt
werden.  Derartige Forschungsergebnisse besagen, dass Vielfalt und
Selbstorganisation, die durch strukturelle Merkmale hervorgerufen und
in emergenten Funktionen veraeusserlicht sind, den Evolutionsimpuls in
einem lebenden System erhalten.  Die Menschen gehoeren einem solchen
System an.  In der Vergangenheit haben wir uns auf soziale Formen mit
variabler Organisation konzentriert.  Iterative Optimierung und
Lernprozesse waren darin Ausdruck innerer Notwendigkeiten, nicht
Ausdruck angenommener oder aufgezwungener Funktionsregeln.

Die gesamte Reproduktionsdynamik, die die gegenwaertigen Anstrengungen
von Staaten und Organisationen bei der Kontrolle des
Bevoelkerungswachstums kennzeichnen, muss wieder an die Praxis gebunden
werden.  Wir koennen davon ausgehen, dass Gemeinschaften, die nach
solchen Prinzipien strukturiert sind, mit einer Art sozialem
Immunsystem ausgestattet sind, das es ihnen ermoeglicht, soziale
Erkrankungen zu erkennen und zu bekaempfen.  Eine Rueckbindung an den
pragmatischen Kontext muss als neue Strategie verstanden werden, die
den Menschen nicht mehr sagt, was zu tun waere, sondern sie zu
wirklichem Tun motiviert.  Alle Vorteile eines sich rapide
entwickelnden Netzwerks der Netzwerke basieren auf dieser
Grundvoraussetzung.  Ein soziales Immunsystem sollte ein Mechanismus
sein, der die fuer das Funktionieren eines jeden Einzelnen und aller
Mitglieder der Gemeinschaft schaedlichen Handlungen verhindert.  Der
Begriff der sozialen Erkrankung laesst Merkmale eines Systems von gut
und boese, richtig und falsch anklingen.  Hier ist aber die fehlende
Verbindung von individueller Leistung und pragmatischem Fokus gemeint.
Mechanismen zur Wiederherstellung dieser Verbindung gruenden auf der
Anerkennung von Vielfalt und auf einer Definition von Einheit,
Mitteln, Zielen und Idealen.

Anpassungsfaehigkeit ergibt sich aus Vielfalt; das gilt fuer die
Faehigkeit, Ressourcen innerhalb einer dynamischen Gemeinschaft zu
mobilisieren.  Staerker als in der Vergangenheit wird der Einzelne in
mehr als nur einer Gemeinschaft eingebunden sein.  Neue
Interaktionsformen und geteilte Ressourcen werden es moeglich machen.
Die heutige Telekommunikation ist erst der Anfang.  Das traditionelle
Verstaendnis von Gemeinschaft, das identisch ist mit Ortsgebundenheit,
wird dem Begriff der Interessengemeinschaften weichen.  Virtuelle
Gemeinschaften im Internet zeigen, was das bedeuten kann.  Das
Hauptmerkmal solcher selbstorganisierender sozialer und kultureller
Zellen ist ihre Modifikationsstruktur waehrend der Koevolution, die
die Einsicht verraet, dass sich politische und soziale Interaktion
veraendert, wenn die Menschen sich veraendern.

Ausgangspunkt fuer das beschriebene Modell war urspruenglich, das
Phaenomen des Lebens genauer zu verstehen und bestimmte Aspekte davon
zu simulieren; es laesst sich auf natuerliches und kuenstliches Leben
gleichermassen anwenden.  Eine globale Wirtschaft, globale politische
Anliegen, globale Verantwortung fuer unser Versorgungssystem, globales
Interesse an Transport- und Kommunikationsnetzen, globales Engagement
fuer die sinnvolle Nutzung von Energie sollten nicht zu einem
Weltstaat fuehren, sondern zu einem Staat mit vielen Welten.  Die
Skala der politischen Praxis hat eine solche Komplexitaet erreicht,
dass das Kokettieren mit globalen Institutionen zur Selbstzerstoerung
durch soziale Implosion fuehren koennte.  Die Alternative waere
Dezentralisierung, leistungsstarke Netzwerke, verbunden mit
hochspezialisierter Aufgabenteilung und effektiven
Integrationsverfahren.

Konkret bedeutet dies, dass Individuen ihre Identitaet in Erfahrungen
finden, die ihren persoenlichen Beitrag in verschiedene
Geschehensablaeufe oder Produkte einbindet.  Sie werden Ressourcen
teilen und Kommunikationsmittel zur Optimierung ihrer Arbeit nutzen.
Zugang zum Wissen anderer mit Hilfe von Mitteln, die die
gleichzeitige Nutzung durch viele ermoeglichen, ist Teil des globalen
Vertrags, den die Menschen abschliessen werden, wenn sie die Vorteile
eines fuer alle zugaenglichen Informationskomplexes und der
Moeglichkeiten einer weltweiten Vernetzung erkannt haben.
Selbstorganisierende Zellen menschlicher Gemeinschaft verschiedenster
Art werden die Vielfalt der Sprachen in der Kultur jenseits der
Schriftkultur, die Freiheit von Buerokratie und eine direktere
Teilhabe am Leben jeder dieser sozialen Einheiten betreiben.

Hochspezialisiertes Wissen, das es den Menschen ermoeglicht, ihre
praktischen Ziele mit Hilfe von neuen Sprachen (mathematischer
Notation, Visualisierung, Diagrammen usw.) zu verfolgen, isoliert die
Experten meist von der Welt.  Wenn Bedingungen geschaffen werden,
relevante Praxiserfahrungen miteinander zu verknuepfen, koennen
Fragmentarisierung und Synthese gleichzeitig verfolgt werden.  Im
Fragmentarisieren sind wir erfahren--es bestimmt unsere eng gefassten
Spezialgebiete.  Aber bei der Synthese sind wir weit weniger versiert.
Es geht also um Integration.

Da menschliche Aktivitaeten die Multidimensionalitaet des Menschen
widerspiegeln, ist es klar, dass Zentren, in denen sich Erfahrungen
ueberlappen--die allerdings aus unterschiedlichen Perspektiven
gewonnen sein koennen--, gerade in den Umfeldern entstehen, in denen
Ressourcen gemeinsam genutzt und die Ergebnisse zum Ausgangspunkt fuer
weitere Erfahrung gemacht werden.  Die Identitaet von Menschen, die
sich im Rahmen einer effizienz- und vielfaltsorientierten Praxis
konstituieren, spiegelt Erfahrungen durch viele Schriftformen und
UEberlebenskonzepte wider, die auf Koevolution und nicht auf
Beherrschung angelegt sind.  Die Entwicklung der Technologie ist
hierfuer ein Beispiel.  Von den Bulletin Boards der fruehen sechziger
Jahre bis zum Internet und dem World Wide Web in unserer Zeit hat
Koevolution zur Konstituierung des vernetzten Buergers gefuehrt.
Michael Hauben, der den englischen Begriff des Netizen praegte, wollte
damit Individuen beschreiben, die um kooperative und kollektive
Taetigkeit bestrebt waren, welche der gesamten Welt von Nutzen sein
sollte.  Konflikte wurden dadurch nicht abgeschafft.  Die
Netz-Gemeinschaft zeichnet sich keinesfalls durch Perfektion, sondern
durch bewusst erstrebte Vielfalt aus, in der Unvollkommenheit keinen
Mangel darstellt.  Ihre Dynamik gruendet auf Unterschieden in
Quantitaet und Qualitaet; ihre Effizienz kommt darin zum Ausdruck,
wieviel Vielfalt sie weiterhin schaffen kann.


Die Loesung ist das Problem.  Oder ist das Problem die Loesung?

Die Unangemessenheit der Schriftkultur und der natuerlichen
Sprache--zweifellos das wesentliche Zeichensystem der Menschen--wird
vor dem Hintergrund neuer Praxiserfahrungen deutlich, die zur
Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen durch viele unterschiedliche
Zeichensysteme fuehren.  Die neue Pragmatik verlangt, dass die
Schriftlichkeit um alternative Ausdrucks-, Kommunikationsund
Bedeutungsmittel ergaenzt wird.  Unsere Analyse der verschiedenen
Formen menschlicher Praxis und Kreativitaet laesst nur eine
Schlussfolgerung zu: Die Muster der menschlichen Beziehungen und die
auf der Grundlage der Schriftkultur geschaffenen Werkzeuge sind keine
optimale Antwort mehr auf die Anforderungen einer gesteigerten
Dynamik unseres Daseins.

Von der Hoffnung verleitet, dass, wenn wir erst einmal die
sprachlichen Extensionen--alles, was Menschen im Akt ihrer
praktischen Selbst-Identifikation unternehmen--erfasst haben, wir
daraus auch Rueckschluesse auf die Intensionen--wie sich eine einzelne
Komponente entfaltet--ziehen koennen, haben wir die intensionalen
Aspekte des menschlichen Handelns selbst uebersehen.  Wir kennen z. B.
die vielfaeltigen Komponenten der mathematischen Praxis: analytisches
Denken, Rationalitaet, Symbolismus, Intuition, AEsthetik.  Aber ueber
die einzelnen Komponenten wissen wir fast gar nichts.  Einige koennen
sprachlich nicht ausgedrueckt werden; andere werden durch Sprache
lediglich auf Stereotype reduziert.  Liegt die Kraft des
mathematischen Ausdrucks in der mathematischen Notation oder in den
aesthetischen Qualitaeten?  In welcher Beziehung stehen diese beiden
Aspekte?  Wo und wie beeinflusst die Intuition das mathematische
Denken?

Die gleichen Kriterien gelten, allerdings folgenreicher, fuer soziale
Handlungen.  Menschliche Interaktion erfordert physische Praesenz; ihr
Auftreten (schoen, passend oder angemessen); ihre Faehigkeit, Gedanken
zu artikulieren; ihre UEberredungskunst; und vieles mehr.  Jede
Komponente ist wichtig, aber wir wissen nur sehr wenig ueber die
spezifischen Auswirkungen einer jeden einzelnen.  Wir sind ueberrascht
darueber, wie Diktatoren an die Macht kommen, und noch mehr, wie sich
die Massen verfuehren lassen.  Aber wir richten unsere Aufmerksamkeit
noch immer nicht auf auf die Motive, die Menschen zu Rassisten,
Kriegstreibern, Scheinheiligen oder auch zu aufrichtigen
Philanthropen werden lassen.  Wenn die Argumente nichts taugen, die
Massen ihnen aber dennoch folgen, dann ist mehr am Werk als nur Worte,
Erscheinung und Psychologie.  Die Sprache hat die Erfahrung unserer
Kulturpraxis dargelegt, ansonsten aber nichts davon, was fuer unsere
natuerliche Existenz von besonderer Relevanz waere.  Die Muster des
kulturellen Verhaltens, die in der Sprache zum Ausdruck kommen, sind
von den Mustern unseres biologischen Lebens offenbar recht unabhaengig
oder haben zumindest eine merkwuerdige, schwer erklaerbare
Unabhaengigkeit gewonnen.

Wir muessen uns ueber unsere Besessenheit von Unverletzbarkeit, die wir
begrifflich leicht fassen koennen, ernsthaft Gedanken machen.  Sie
zeigt sich in der Schriftkultur der Medizin besonders deutlich.  Die
ploetzliche Entdeckung von AIDS, die der Euphorie der Unverletzbarkeit
ein Ende setzte, kann uns vielleicht dabei helfen, das zunehmende
Auseinanderdriften unseres kulturellen Lebens--zu dem die Sexualitaet
gehoert--und unseres natuerlichen Lebens--zu dem die Fortpflanzung
gehoert--zu verstehen.  Die Magie war ein Versuch, eine harmonische
Beziehung zur aeusseren Welt beizubehalten.  Es ist noch immer nicht
klar, ob es die Medizin oder die Umarmung der Eltern ist, die die
Kolik eines Kindes heilt; oder ob die psychosomatische Natur vieler
moderner Krankheiten von der Technologie des heutigen
Gesundheitssystems in den Griff zu bekommen ist.  Wir wissen indes,
dass die Bevoelkerungszahlen zurueckgingen, wenn den Menschen neue
Ernaehrungs- und Hygienevorschriften aufgezwungen wurden, weil die
Lebensmuster beeinflusst werden, wenn ein bestehendes Gleichgewicht
wegen einer fremden Form verworfen wird.  Dies geschah nicht nur mit
den Voelkern in Asien, Afrika, Australien und Neuseeland, sondern auch
mit den Eingeborenen der amerikanischen Kontinente.  Die aus der
analytischen Praxis der Selbstkonstituierung entstandenen
medizinischen Konzepte--von denen viele in der Schriftkultur der
Medizin verdinglicht sind--verwerfen die Vielfalt moeglicher
Gleichgewichte und legen den Verdacht nahe, dass hier die Loesung das
eigentliche Problem ist.

Wo sie anwendbar ist, funktioniert die Schriftkultur sehr gut, aber
sie ist nicht die universelle Antwort auf die immer komplexere Praxis
der Menschheit.  Da die Menschen die Erfahrungen mit anderen
nichtsprachlichen Zeichensystemen nicht voellig ausser acht gelassen
haben, konnten sie die Muster der Schulung, der Einweisung, der
industriellen Produktion, der modernen Landwirtschaft und des
Gesundheitswesens aendern.  Davon ist auch das Verstaendnis von
Bereichen betroffen, die lange Zeit durch die Schriftkultur verdeckt
waren: das Erkennen von Mustern, Bildmanipulation, Design.  Dadurch
ergeben sich neue Methoden, mit denen neue Bereiche der menschlichen
Erfahrung in Angriff genommen werden koennen: Statt Bilder durch Worte
zu beschreiben und einen Handlungsverlauf oder ein Ziel mit Hilfe
eines Textes zu definieren und dann durch den Text den Gebrauch der
visuellen Elemente steuern zu lassen, nutzen wir heute die
Vermittlungskraft von Designsystemen mit integrierten Planungs- und
Managementeinrichtungen.  Ein neues Produkt, ein neues Gebaeude und
Konzepte im Bereich der Staedteplanung werden hervorgebracht, waehrend
das entsprechende Computerprogramm die Daten zu den Kosten, den
oekologischen Folgen, den sozialen Auswirkungen und der
zwischenmenschlichen Kommunikation verarbeitet.  Diese Praxis, die
die Schriftkultur ueberwindet, ohne sie ganz aufzugeben, hat neue
Faehigkeiten freigelegt: visuelles Bewusstsein, Verarbeitung von
Informationen aller Art, Vernetzung und neue Formen menschlicher
Integration, die sehr viel weniger starr sind als die, die fuer die
ausschliesslich durch die Sprache erfolgende Integration typisch sind.

Die Schriftkultur muss nicht abgeschafft, aber ebensowenig muss alles
auf sie reduziert werden.  Wo sie noch sinnvoll Anwendung findet, ist
sie lebendig und gesund.  Im Internet und dem World Wide Web
vervollstaendigt sie das Repertoire der fuer die computergestuetzte
Kommunikation typischen Interaktionsmittel.  Das Fernsehen fesselt
ein breites Publikum mit einseitiger Kommunikation.  Die Ambition des
World Wide Web liegt darin, sinnvolle Interaktionen zwischen zwei
oder mehr Menschen zu ermoeglichen.

Die Kultur jenseits der Schriftkultur zeichnet sich durch Vielfalt
aus und stuetzt sich auf die Dynamik der Selbstorganisation.  Um aber
Erfolg zu haben, muessen mehrere Bedingungen erfuellt werden: Wir haben
z. B. bei allen Formen der Selbstkonstituierung noch nicht die
Faehigkeit entwickelt, in anderen Medien als der natuerlichen Sprache
zu denken.  Wie beim Erlernen einer Fremdsprache uebersetzen viele
Menschen immer noch von einer Sprache in die andere.  Wenn das nicht
funktioniert, suchen sie in der Sprache nach Hilfe, die sie
beherrschen, statt in der alternativen Sprache zu fragen, in der sie
die Antwort erwarten.  Nachdem Intuition von Rationalitaet und System
verdraengt wurde, werden nur noch geringfuegige Anstrengungen
unternommen, den Ursprung der Intuition, ob in der Mathematik, in der
Medizin, im Sport, in den Kuensten, den Markttransaktionen, im Krieg,
bei der Essenszubereitung oder in sozialen Aktivitaeten zu verstehen.

Innerhalb der neuen Skala und der neuen Dynamik haengt die
Zivilisation vom Zusammenspiel mehrerer Elemente ab.  Die an der
Integration dieser Vielfalt beteiligte Logistik kann kaum durch
schriftkulturelle Methoden erfolgen, und sie ist fuer das Ergebnis
entscheidend.  Die Schriftkultur drueckt die groben und linearen
Beziehungsebenen aus.  Neue Praxiserfahrungen mit erhoehter Effizienz
verlangen differenziertere Ebenen und auf nichtlineare Phaenomene
ausgerichtete Werkzeuge, um mit den parallel verlaufenden Prozessen
der Selbstkonstituierung des einzelnen und der Gesellschaft umgehen
zu koennen.


Der Umgang mit den Wahlmoeglichkeiten

Wenn die Multiplikation von Moeglichkeiten nicht auch die effektiven
Mittel ermoeglichen wuerde, zwischen ihnen auszuwaehlen, waeren wir vom
Strudel der Entropie erfasst.  In der Praxis fuehrt dies zu einem ganz
natuerlichen Verlauf der Dinge: neue Moeglichkeiten zuzulassen, die
sich als Alternativen ausweisen, bedeutet, bekannte und erprobte
Optionen auszuschliessen.  Wo z. B. in einer Demokratie die
Buerokratie die Oberhand gewinnt, erfuellt eine Ratssitzung nur noch
dekorative Funktionen.  Die Rede des amerikanischen Praesidenten zur
Lage der Nation zieht keinerlei Konsequenzen nach sich.

Die Moeglichkeit, andere Zeichensysteme zu nutzen, ist keineswegs neu.
Selbst die Moeglichkeit des Synkretismus ist alles andere als neu.
Neu ist das Bewusstsein von Fehlfunktionen und moeglichem Verlust der
Kontrolle ueber eine komplexe Praxis.  Unter den vielen Formen, die
die Beziehung zwischen dem einzelnen und der Gesellschaft festlegen,
ist das Rechtssystem vermutlich das beste Beispiel.  Ob unabhaengig,
als Regel- und Kontrollbereich mit eigenen Motivationen oder als Teil
anderer Komponenten des sozialen und politischen Lebens, kodifiziert
die Institution der Gerechtigkeit ihre Typologien, Klassifikationen
und Regeln in Gesetzen.  Hier werden Werte staendig durch pragmatische
Handlungen ueberprueft.  An der Integritaet des einzelnen und seiner
rechtmaessig erworbenen Gueter, an der Verbindlichkeit von
Verpflichtungen und an vielen anderen Regeln, die fuer das Gemeinwohl
wichtig sind, hat sich die Rechtspraxis entwickelt.  Richtig oder
falsch, Kriterien, die sich entwickelt haben, als sich praktisches
Handeln noch unmittelbar auf das Wohlergehen der Gemeinschaft
auswirkte, werden jetzt in einem Bereich mit eigenem Leben und
eigenen Regeln definiert.  Toeten, Stehlen und Faelschen sind
Handlungen, die in den schriftlich niedergelegten Gesetzen klar
definiert sind.  Aber das in der Schriftkultur verankerte Recht hat
sich von der tatsaechlichen Welt losgeloest und konstituiert eine
eigene Wirklichkeit mit eigenen Beweggruenden.  Da dies so ist,
ueberrascht es nicht, dass die Rechtspraxis nichts anderes ist als die
Interpretation von Texten und der Versuch, mit Hilfe der Sprache
Loesungen zu finden, auch wenn die Loesung eigentlich eine Chimaere ist
und nicht auf der Wirklichkeit gruendet.

Das Rechtssystem reagiert auf Innovationen, indem es Regeln, die
einer anderen Praxis entspringen--die DNA-Analyse als Beweismittel
vor Gericht ist hier ein gutes Beispiel--, in ihre eigenen
Evaluationskriterien zwaengt.  Statt einen pro-aktiven Kontext fuer die
Entfaltung des menschlichen Geistes zu schaffen, verteidigt die
Rechtspraxis letztlich nur ihre eigenen Interessen.

Als Erweiterung der aus der Schriftkultur hervorgegangenen Sprache
entwickelt die Rechtssprache ihre eigenen Effizienzregeln und legt
Erfolgskriterien fest, die den Prozess der Gerechtigkeit korrumpieren.
Sie ist ein typisches Beispiel fuer sprachliche Funktionsdefekte,
genauso erhellend wie die Sprache der Politik.  Juristische und
politische Praxis dokumentieren auf unterschiedliche Weise, wie die
Demokratie scheitert, wenn sie die in der Buerokratie des
Rechtssystems und der reifizierten Machtbeziehungen manifeste
symbolische Phase erreicht.


Der richtige Umgang mit den Wahlmoeglichkeiten

Selbstdefinition impliziert die Faehigkeit, einen Bereich von
Moeglichkeiten einzurichten.  Aber die Moeglichkeiten ergeben sich
nicht von alleine.  Im UEbergang von der Schriftkultur zu einem
Stadium jenseits von ihr erweitern sich die globalen Moeglichkeiten
dramatisch, waehrend sich die lokalen, individuellen Bereiche
proportional verringern.  Dies geschieht, weil das, was auf globaler
Ebene nach einer Multiplikation von Moeglichkeiten aussieht, auf der
Ebene des einzelnen eine Sache effektiver Selektionsprozeduren wird.
Solange die Auswahl nicht sehr gross ist, stellt die Selektion kein
Problem dar.

Die primitive Familie hatte bei der Wahl von Nahrungsmitteln,
Fortpflanzung und Gesundheitsvorkehrungen wenig Moeglichkeiten.  Die
Auswahl wurde groesser, als die Praxiserfahrung der
Selbstkonstituierung sich diversifizierte.  Herumziehende
Populationen trafen eine Auswahl, die anders war als die, die sich
dem sesshaften Menschen bot.  Die ersten Staedte wiesen
Beziehungsstrukturen auf, fuer die die geschriebene Sprache gerade
angemessen war.  Die heutige Megalopolis bietet Wahlmoeglichkeiten von
ganz anderem Ausmass.  Innerhalb eines solchen Bereichs von
Moeglichkeiten gibt es keine effektiven Selektionsmethoden.  Die
Reduzierung von praktisch unendlich vielen Wahlmoeglichkeiten auf eine
endliche Zahl von Realisierungen ist bestenfalls eine Sache des
Zufalls.  Umgekehrt kann das Motto "Lokal handeln, global denken"
schnell zum Scheitern fuehren.  Viele Leistungen auf lokaler Ebene
wuerden bei einer globalen Umsetzung scheitern, wenn sie nicht von
vornherein auf Globalitaet angelegt waeren.

Zur Schriftkultur gehoerte die Erwartung, dass Menschen, die lesen und
schreiben koennen, durch ihr Sprachwissen zugleich auch ueber gute
Selektionsmethoden verfuegen.  Jenseits der Schriftkultur gibt es
fortlaufende, stets nur kurzfristige, begrenzte und wertfreie
Entscheidungen.  Es scheint, als waehlten sich die Wahlmoeglichkeiten
ihre Subjekte selbst.  Das erklaert, warum heute immer mehr Menschen
in den Staedten leben wollen.  Ist eine Wahlmoeglichkeit einmal
ausgeschoepft, folgt die naechste automatisch, als Folge der Skala, und
nicht etwa als Suche nach Alternativen.  Dies gilt im uebrigen auch
fuer das Berufsleben, das ebenfalls den kuerzeren Zyklen der Neuerung
und des Wandels ausgesetzt ist.

Die Mechanismen der sozialen Segmentierung, die das Ergebnis der
mannigfaltigen Vermittlungsmechanismen sind, macht aus der Frage nach
dem richtigen Umgang mit den Wahlmoeglichkeiten ein demokratisches
Prinzip.  Schauen wir uns einige konkrete Optionen an: sollen wir
Kondome an Schueler verteilen oder nicht; sollen wir das Recht, dem
eigenen Leben ein Ende zu setzen, einraeumen oder nicht (Pro-Wahl oder
Pro-Leben); sollen wir heterosexuelle Familienprivilegien auf
homosexuelle Lebensgemeinschaften uebertragen oder nicht; sollen wir
einheitliche Pruefungsmassstaebe im Bildungssektor einfuehren oder nicht?
Diese Beispiele werden aus dem grossen Zusammenhang menschlicher
Selbstkonstituierung herausgenommen und der Evaluierung durch den
(von den Medien beherrschten Meinungsbildungs-) Markt ueberantwortet,
nicht aber der verantwortungsvollen Ausuebung zivilstaatlicher
Verpflichtungen.

Die Vermittlungsmechanismen der neuen Zeit bewirken, dass die
Auswahlmoeglichkeiten, denen sich eine Gemeinschaft gegenuebersieht,
auf der Ebene des einzelnen nahezu irrelevant werden.  Im neuen
staendig anwachsenden Universum der Moeglichkeiten geben die Menschen
ihre Autonomie und Selbstbestimmung auf und werden zu Mitgliedern
verschiedener Gemeinschaften.  Sie haben an den Wahlmoeglichkeiten der
Gesellschaft in dem Masse Teil, in dem diese ihren Moeglichkeiten und
Erwartungen entsprechen.  Aber sie haben die Mittel, sich aus einer
Gesellschaft zurueckzuziehen, wenn sich ihre Entscheidungen (bezueglich
Frieden, Krieg, Freiheit des einzelnen, Lebensart usw.) von denen des
Staates unterscheiden.  Die Buerger der transnationalen Welt nehmen an
der Dynamik der Veraenderung in einem weitaus staerkeren Mass teil als
diejenigen, die sich dem schriftgebundenen Ideal des Nationalismus
und der ethnischen Zugehoerigkeit widmen.

Wir koennen zum Mond fliegen.  Wir koennen es uns leisten, an
einzigartigen Ereignissen teilzunehmen--an grossen Konzerten,
Wettbewerben, Auktionen--einige persoenlich, andere mit Hilfe der
digitalen Mittel.  Jeder Mensch koennte Praesident oder Mitglied einer
gesetzgebenden Instanz werden; aber nur wenige koennen es sich leisten,
sich fuer eine solche Position zu bewerben.  Ob nun aufgrund von
Reichtum, Intelligenz, Sensibilitaet, Herkunft, Geschlecht, Alter oder
Glauben--bei der Wahrnehmung der Wahlmoeglichkeiten sind wir nicht
alle gleich, obwohl wir alle die gleichen Rechte haben.  Mit dem
Wahlangebot richtig umzugehen, heisst also auch, Ziele und Mittel
miteinander in Einklang zu bringen.  Die Schriftkultur kann das nicht
leisten.  Dieses vollzieht sich zwischen den einzelnen Individuen und
zwischen den vielen Gemeinschaften, denen sie angehoeren.  Die
verschiedenen Sprachen, die bei der praktischen Entfaltung all derer
involviert sind, die sich in diese Vielfalt der Moeglichkeiten
einbinden, funktionieren effektiver.

Das Netz der Beziehungen, aus denen unser Dasein besteht, und die
Beziehungsmuster werden sich weiter veraendern und auf globaler Ebene
komplexer werden, im Gegensatz zur lokalen Ebene, auf der sie
begrenzter werden.  Mit einer Zunahme von globaler Freiheit verlieren
wir lokale Dynamik.  Auf der jeweiligen Ebene, auf der wir unsere
Vermittlungsleistung ausueben, haben wir eine fast totale Kontrolle
ueber unsere eigene Effizienz.  Jeder der zahlreichen Anbieter von
Dienstleistungen, jeder Arzt, Rechtsanwalt oder Schriftsteller gibt
ein Beispiel ab fuer die lokalen Wahlmoeglichkeiten, die sich aus der
gesteigerten Produktivitaet derer, denen sie ihre Dienstleistungen
anbieten, ergibt.  Auf einer hoeheren Ebene, die diese
Dienstleistungen integriert--ganz gleich, ob es sich um Rostschutz,
Roentgenverarbeitung, Kommunikationsdesign oder Buchhaltung handelt--,
wird die Zahl der Auswahlmoeglichkeiten geringer.  Folglich wird die
Koordinierung ausschlaggebend.  Die Strategie des Outsourcing gruendet
auf der UEberzeugung, dass maximale Effizienz eine Form der
Spezialisierung verlangt, die Firmen nicht erreichen koennen.  Wenn
sich der Prozess in diese Richtung weiterentwickelt, wird die
Koordinierung bald das schwierigste Problem unserer Praxis sein.  Das
liegt an der Komplexitaet des Problems sowie daran, dass es keine
effektiven Prozeduren gibt, um sie zu vereinfachen.  Je einfacher
eine Aufgabe ist, desto komplexer gestaltet sich ihre Integration.
Daraus laesst sich vielleicht kein Gesetz, aber eine weitere These
ableiten: die allgemeine Komplexitaet bleibt erhalten, ganz gleich,
wie Systeme unter- oder Aufgaben verteilt werden.  Wenn Aufgaben fuer
eine effiziente Ausfuehrung aufgeteilt werden, wird die Komplexitaet
von der Aufgabe auf die Integration uebertragen.


Abwaegungen

Kulturelle, historische, wirtschaftliche, soziale und andere
Entwicklungen tragen zu unserer Vorstellung von Schriftkultur bei.
Ihre Krise ist symptomatisch fuer all das, was die Schriftkultur
notwendig hervorgebracht hat und was auf den Funktionsweisen
schriftkultureller Gesellschaften begruendet ist.  Die Krise der
Schriftlichkeit ist nicht eine allgemeine kulturelle oder
wirtschaftliche Krise.  Die Emanzipation der Frau begann z. B. nicht
mit der Emanzipation der Sprache, nimmt aber Sprache in Anspruch.
Als Ausdruck besonderer sozialer Beziehungen geben
geschlechtsspezifische Strukturen einer Sprache einen Status wieder,
dem zu widersetzen sich Frauen aufgefordert fuehlen koennten.

Viele andere Muster menschlicher Interaktionen, die zu Handlungen
fuehren, die wiederum Veraenderungen hervorrufen, sind tief in der
Sprache verwurzelt.  Wenn wir die Entwicklung unserer Kinder in der
ihnen von uns auferlegten Schriftkultur beobachten, zaehlen wir
geradezu die Woerter, die sie gelernt haben und messen ihren
Fortschritt an der Faehigkeit, Wuensche, Meinungen und Fragen zu
artikulieren.  Dabei vernachlaessigen wir die Frage, welche Art von
Welt die Sprache ihnen im Prozess des Spracherwerbs eroeffnet.  Welche
Art der Praxiserfahrung ermoeglicht die Sprache?  Wenn die Kinder sich
von unserer Sprache loesen, ist es fast zu spaet, das Problem zu
verstehen.  Der Sprachgebrauch erscheint so natuerlich, dass seine
syntaktischen und wertebeladenen Konventionen nicht in Frage gestellt
werden.  Wir akzeptieren die Sprache so, wie sie auf uns uebertragen
wird.  Sie kommt mit den Goettern oder mit Gott, mit Guete, Recht,
Wahrheit, Schoenheit und anderen Werten sowie mit Kategorisierungen
(nach Geschlecht, Herkunft oder Generation), die wir fuer so ewig
halten wie die Sprache selbst.  Wir uebertragen die Sprache auf unsere
Kinder, nur um uns durch ihre eigene Sprache, die ihrem eigenen
pragmatischen Bezugsrahmen angepasst ist, herausgefordert zu sehen.

Als ein Rahmen, in dem Kinder auf Wunsch ihrer Eltern und der
Gesellschaft denken, kommunizieren und handeln, weist die Sprache
zwei widerspruechliche Merkmale auf: Freiheit und Zwang.  Der
allumfassende Umbruch, dem wir uns ausgesetzt sehen, betrifft beide.
Um in einer Gesellschaft mit hochspezialisierten Interaktionsmustern
effektiv bestehen zu koennen, ist ein Abwaegen zwischen Freiheiten und
Zwaengen unausweichlich.  Auf sozialer und kultureller Ebene
beeintraechtigen die Zwaenge, die in allgemein verbreiteten Vorurteilen
und Ideologien zum Ausdruck kommen, unseren begrenzten
Entscheidungsspielraum und unsere persoenliche Integritaet.  Die
Sprache entpuppt sich nicht nur als Medium zum Ausdruck von Idealen,
sondern auch als widerspenstiger Traeger alter und neuer Vorurteile.
Sie ist auch ein Instrument der Taeuschung und birgt im Ideal der
Schriftkultur die offenkundigste und folgenreichste aller Taeuschungen,
die Schriftlichkeit als Allheilmittel fuer jedes Problem der
Menschheit herauszustellen: fuer Armut, Ungerechtigkeit und Ignoranz,
bei militaerischen Konflikten, fuer Krankheit, Hunger und schliesslich
sogar fuer die Unfaehigkeit, mit neuen Entwicklungen in Wissenschaft
und Technik Schritt zu halten.  Interessanterweise glauben die
Netoyens das gleiche im Hinblick auf das Internet!  In ihrer Kampagne
fuer eine freie Wahl der Literalitaet sind sie genauso dogmatisch
bezueglich ihrer Kommunikationsformen wie die Modern Language
Association und vergleichbare Organisationen in anderen Laendern
bezueglich der altmodischen Schriftkultur.

Wir muessen akzeptieren, dass unsere Welt mit ihren diversifizierten
Formen der Praxis (die der Vielfalt der Menschen entsprechen) mehr
als nur eine Form von Schriftlichkeit benoetigt.  Aber das allein
wuerde kein ausreichender Grund fuer eine Veraenderung des gegenwaertigen
Bildungssystems sein, wenn nicht gleichzeitig auch neue Wege des
Wissenserwerbs entwickelt werden.  Die Annahme, dass Sprache ein
hochentwickeltes Zeichensystem ist, trifft zwar zu, besagt aber nicht
unbedingt, dass jedes Mitglied einer Gesellschaft diese Sprache
beherrschen muss, um in der Gesellschaft zu bestehen.  Um uns von
dieser Vorstellung zu befreien, brauchen wir mehr als das Beispiel
einzelner Menschen, die in Bereichen, in denen Schriftkultur und
Schrift nicht vorherrschend oder gaenzlich ueberfluessig sind, ein hohes
Mass an Effizienz an den Tag legen.


Aus Schnittstellen lernen

Das aufregende Abenteuer, menschliche Merkmale und Funktionen
kuenstlich nachzubilden, ist vermutlich so alt wie das Bewusstsein des
Selbst und anderer.  Werkzeuge und Maschinen zu beherrschen, um die
Effizienz der Praxis zu maximieren, war immer eine Erfahrung, die mit
Sprachgebrauch und Handwerk zu tun hatte.  Die groesste Herausforderung
bestand vielleicht im Gebrauch von Computern mit dem Ziel, die
Faehigkeit zu rechnen, Worte und Bilder zu verarbeiten,
Produktionsvorgaenge zu steuern, komplexe Daten zu deuten und sogar
Teile des menschlichen Denkens nachzubilden.

Programmiersprachen dienen als Vermittlungseinheiten.  Mit einem
eingeschraenkten Vokabular und aeusserst praeziser Logik uebersetzen sie
Teilschritte eines Vorgangs, die nach Ansicht der Programmierer
ausgefuehrt werden muessen, um erfolgreich Zahlen zu berechnen, Woerter
zu verarbeiten, Bilder zu verarbeiten und sogar logische Operationen
vorzunehmen, um Schach zu spielen und einen menschlichen Gegner bei
diesem Spiel zu schlagen.  Eine Programmiersprache ist die
UEbersetzung eines Ziels in eine Beschreibung logischer Prozesse, mit
deren Hilfe das Ziel erreicht werden kann.  Benutzer von Computern
haben mit der Programmiersprache nichts zu tun; sie wenden sich ueber
die Sprache der Schnittstelle an den Computer: Woerter auf Deutsch
oder Englisch (oder einer anderen Sprache, fuer die die Schnittstelle
entworfen ist) oder Bilder, die fuer die gewuenschten Ziele oder
Handlungen stehen.  Die Maschine spricht oder versteht die hoehere
Sprache der Schnittstelle nicht.  Die Interaktion des Benutzers mit
der Maschine wird von Schnittstellen-Programmen in das uebersetzt, was
eine Maschine verarbeiten kann.  Effiziente Schnittstellen anzubieten
ist vermutlich ebenso wichtig wie die Gestaltung hochgradig
abstrakter Programmiersprachen und das Schreiben von Programmen in
diesen Sprachen.  Ohne solche Schnittstellen koennten wahrscheinlich
nur wenige Menschen mit einem Computer umgehen.  Die Erfahrung der
Schnittstellen-Gestaltung kann uns dabei helfen, die Richtung des
Wandels, zu dem uns ein neuer pragmatischer Rahmen verpflichtet, zu
verstehen.  Die Entwicklung laeuft darauf hinaus, dass der Computer von
unserem Schreibtisch verschwindet.  Der Zugang zu digitaler
Verarbeitung, nicht jedoch zur digitalen Maschine ist noetig.  Das
gleiche galt fuer die Elektrizitaet.  Frueher wurde sie zu Hause oder am
Arbeitsplatz erzeugt, wo sie gerade gebraucht wurde.  Jetzt kommt sie
ueber Verteilernetze zu uns.

Die natuerliche Sprache erfuellte die Funktion einer Schnittstelle,
lange bevor dieses Konzept entstand.  Die Schriftkultur sollte die
staendige Schnittstelle menschlicher Praxiserfahrungen sein, ein
Bindeglied in der Beziehung zwischen dem einzelnen und der
Gesellschaft.  Im Idealfall sollte die Schnittstelle die Art, wie
Menschen sich konstituieren, nicht beeinflussen, d. h. sie sollte
hinsichtlich der menschlichen Identitaet neutral sein.  Das bedeutet,
dass die Menschen sich veraendern und die Aufgaben variieren koennen.
Die Schnittstelle wuerde die Veraenderung beruecksichtigen und neuen
Zielen Rechnung tragen.  Selbst in ihren kuehnsten Traeumen wuerden
Computerwissenschaftler und Forscher im Bereich der
Kognitionswissenschaft und kuenstlichen Intelligenz, die mit
intelligenten Schnittstellen arbeiten, eine solche lebendige
Schnittstelle nicht erwaegen.  Schnittstellen wirken sich auf die
Natur praktischer Erfahrungen im Rechenbereich aus.  Wenn diese
komplexer werden, kommt es zu einem Zusammenbruch, da die
Schnittstellen nicht mehr Schritt halten koennen.  Statt eine bessere
Interaktion zu unterstuetzen, kann eine Schnittstelle sie
beeintraechtigen und das Ergebnis einer Berechnung beeinflussen.  Die
Sprache hat dem Druck recht gut standgehalten.  Sie waechst mit jeder
neuen menschlichen Erfahrung und kann sich einer Vielzahl von
Aufgaben anpassen, weil sich die Menschen anpassen, die sich mit
Hilfe der Sprache konstituieren.  Aber wegen der engen Beziehung
zwischen den Menschen und ihrer Sprache werden neue Erfahrungen durch
die Sprache eingeschraenkt, weil sie diese den Erwartungen von
Kohaerenz unterwirft.  Das ausdrucksvolle und kommunikative Potential
der Sprache erreicht seinen Hoehepunkt, wenn die Pragmatik, die sie
moeglich und notwendig machte, ihr eigenes Effizienzpotential
erschoepft hat.  Schriftkultur kann die menschlichen Faehigkeiten in
der Praxis ausserhalb ihres eigenen pragmatischen Bereichs nicht mehr
unterstuetzen.  Die Schriftlichkeit schraenkt den Erfahrungsraum der
Menschen auf ihren eigenen Erfahrungsraum ein und begrenzt damit
menschliches Wachstum.

Viele beeindruckende menschliche Leistungen, vermutlich die Mehrheit
von ihnen, sind ein Zeugnis der Leistung der Sprache als
Schnittstelle.  Aber diese Leistungen zeugen auch davon, was passiert,
wenn die Schnittstelle zu ihrem eigenen Motivationsbereich wird oder
Ziele verfolgt, die zu einer erzwungenen Uniformitaet von Erfahrungen
fuehren.  Waere die Schriftkultur ein neutrales Vermittlungsinstrument
gewesen, haette sie mit der neuen Skala und den entsprechenden
Effizienzerwartungen Schritt gehalten als diese Schwelle einmal
erreicht wurde.  Aufeinanderfolgende Formen religioeser,
wissenschaftlicher, ideologischer, politischer und wirtschaftlicher
Dominanz sind Beispiele fuer maechtige Schnittstellenmechanismen.  Um
das Dilemma besser zu verstehen, koennen wir die Abfolge von
Schnittstellen bezueglich der religioesen Praxis mit der Abfolge von
Schnittstellen fuer Computerbenutzer vergleichen.  Ungeachtet der
grundlegenden Unterschiede zwischen diesen beiden Bereichen zeigt
sich eine verblueffende AEhnlichkeit.  Beide beginnen als
eingeschraenkte Erfahrungen, die anfaenglich wenigen Auserwaehlten
zugaenglich sind, und erweitern sich von einem begrenzten
Zeichensystem zu sehr reichhaltigen multimedialen Umfeldern.  Aus der
Entwicklung von einem begrenzten, geheim gehaltenen Bereich zur
breiten, durch triviales Vokabular ermoeglichten OEffnung treten beide
als zweikoepfige Phaenomene hervor: Die Sprache der urspruenglich
wenigen Auserwaehlten wird zu einer Schnittstelle mit der Sprache der
Menschen, die nach und nach in diese Erfahrung integriert werden.
Niemand sollte diesen Vergleich, der nur die grundsaetzliche Natur der
Schnittstellenerfahrung beschreiben soll, falsch verstehen.  Wir
koennten uns genausogut auf Erfahrungen in der Wirtschaft, der Politik,
der Ideologie, der Wissenschaft, der Mode oder der Kunst beziehen.

Die Schriftkultur hat zu einer gewissen Bestaendigkeit, aber auch zu
einem Verlust an Vielfalt gefuehrt.  Jede Interaktions- oder
Schnittstellensprache hatte mit ihrem Verblassen auch Erfahrungen
mitgenommen, die nicht wieder zurueckzugewinnen waren.  Die Beziehung
zwischen dem einzelnen und der Gemeinschaft, die frueher einmal auf
verschiedenen Ebenen sehr intensiv war, schwaechte sich mit Zunahme
der Schriftkultur ab.  Die Schriftkultur normiert diese Beziehung,
indem sie sie in einen Multiple-choice-Test umwandelt.
Informationsverarbeitungstechniken, die auf schriftgebundene Formen
sozialer Interaktion angewandt werden, verlangen eine noch staerkere
Standardisierung, um effizient zu sein.  Damit wird das Individuum
wegrationalisiert, und die Gemeinschaft entwickelt sich zu einem Ort
fuer Datenmanagement statt fuer menschliche Interaktion.  Dieser Prozess
verdeutlicht, was passiert, wenn die Schnittstelle die Oberhand
gewinnt und mit sich selbst interagiert.

Die bisherigen UEberlegungen illustrieren, wie wichtig ein Verstaendnis
vom Wesen der Schnittstellenprozesse ist.  Aber die Erfahrung, die in
der computergestuetzten Wissensforschung gemacht wurde, deutet auf
weitere, fuer die Beziehung zwischen dem Individuum und der
Gesellschaft entscheidende Aspekte hin: Die Menschen konstituieren
sich durch eine Vielfalt praktischer Erfahrungen, die nach
Alternativen zur Sprache verlangen.  Leistungsstarke mathematische
Notationen, Diagramme, Visualisierungstechniken, Akustik, Holographie
und der virtuelle Raum sind solche Alternativen.  Nichtlineare
Verbunde und kognitive Pfade, die in der Hypertext-Struktur des World
Wide Web verkoerpert sind, gehoeren ebenfalls dazu.  Sprache zu
verarbeiten, heisst noch nicht, diese Moeglichkeiten zu integrieren.

Kognitive Erfordernisse legen den auf nichtsprachlichen Mitteln
gruendenden Erfahrungen wegen der Intensitaet und der Natur kognitiver
Prozesse sowie der benoetigten Speicherleistung starke Einschraenkungen
auf.  Die genetischen Anlagen, die aus der sprachgebundenen Praxis
der Selbstkonstituierung entstanden sind, eignen sich nicht unbedingt
fuer grundlegend andere Ausdrucksmoeglichkeiten.  Die Kommunikation
erfordert ein gemeinsames Substrat, das in einem
Akkulturierungsprozess ueber mehrere Generationen hinweg aufgebaut wird.
Unterstuetzt von den "Neuen Medien" wird die Kommunikation nicht
praeziser.  Programme werden entworfen, um das Verstaendnis von
Sprachen zu ermoeglichen.  Alles, was je geschrieben wurde, wird
eingescannt und fuer die Zeichenerkennung gespeichert.  Abbildungen
werden in kurze Beschreibungen uebersetzt.  Eine semantische
Komponente wird an alles gehaengt, was die Menschen mit dem Computer
verarbeiten.  Man hofft, dass solche Mittel routinemaessig eingesetzt
werden koennen, auch wenn der Kompass auf ein schwer fassbares Ziel
gerichtet sein mag.  Selbst wenn die Maschinen verstehen, was wir von
ihnen wollen--d. h. wenn sie Sprach- und Schrifterkennungsfunktionen
in ihre Betriebssysteme eingebaut bekommen--, muessen immer noch wir
unsere Ziele artikulieren.  Eine Technologie, die viele heute noch
von Menschen ausgefuehrte Handlungen automatisieren kann, wird das
Ergebnis und damit die Effizienz des Aufwands erhoehen.  Aber die
eigentliche Herausforderung liegt darin herauszufinden, wie die
Beziehung zwischen dem Moeglichen und dem Notwendigen optimiert werden
kann.  Vorgaenge, die das Ergebnis mit den vielen Kriterien
korrelieren, anhand derer die Menschen oder die Maschinen bestimmen,
wie sinnvoll das Ergebnis ist, sind wichtiger als die blosse
technologische Leistung.  Die Schriftkultur hat sich dafuer nicht als
das geeignete Instrument angeboten.

Menschen und Sprache veraendern sich gemeinsam.  Individuen werden
durch die Sprache geformt; ihre praktischen Erfahrungen formen
ihrerseits die Sprache und schaffen einen Bedarf an neuen Sprachen.
Wenn wir die Sprache und den Menschen nicht entkoppeln koennen,
besonders mit Blick auf die Parallelentwicklung von genetischen
Anlagen und sprachlicher Fertigkeit, werden wir uns weiterhin im
Teufelskreis von Ausdruck und Darstellung bewegen.  Das Thema ist
nicht die Sprache an sich, sondern die Behauptung, dass die
Darstellung das dominante, man darf sagen ausschliessliche Paradigma
menschlichen Handelns ist.  Weder die Wissenschaft noch die
Philosophie haben eine Alternative zur Darstellung geschaffen.

Die physische Realitaet ist mehr als das, was die Sprache erfassen
kann.  Und die Dynamik unseres Daseins in einer Welt, deren eigene
Dynamik wiederum die unsere integriert und zugleich weit ueber sie
hinausgeht, ist ebenfalls umfassender.  Faehigkeiten fuer das UEberleben
in der physischen Welt--Faehigkeiten, die Kinder und neugeborene Tiere
besitzen--werden nur teilweise in der Sprache dargestellt.  Das
gesamte Reich des instinktiven Verhaltens gehoert hierher sowie die
Koordination und die mannigfaltige Art, eine Beziehung zu Raum, Zeit
und zu anderen Lebewesen herzustellen.  Fortgeschrittene biologische
und kognitive Forschung (Maturanas Werk ist in diesem Bereich
fuehrend) zeigt, dass verschiedene Organismen ohne die Vorzuege der
sprachlichen Darstellung ueberleben.  Sehr persoenliche menschliche
Erfahrungen--darunter Schmerz, Liebe, Hass und Freude--stellen sich
ohne die Vorzuege und Beschraenkungen der Sprachdarstellung ein.

Es gibt Faehigkeiten, fuer die wir keine Darstellung in der Sprache
haben.  Man hat versucht, sie unter solchen Begriffen wie
Parapsychologie, Magie und nichtsprachliche Kommunikation zu fassen.
Beschreibungen ihrer Leistungen loesen Zweifel oder Laecheln aus.  Das
ungewoehnliche und unerklaerliche Verhalten von sogenannten idiots
savants gehoert ebenfalls in diese Kategorie.  Ein idiot savant hoert
ein Klavierkonzert und spielt es brillant nach, obwohl er oder sie
eins und eins nicht zusammenzaehlen kann.  Eine Streichholzschachtel
faellt hinunter, und der idiot savant kann nach einem Blick auf die
Schachtel sagen, wie viele Streichhoelzer herausgefallen sind.  Diese
Leistungen sind nachgewiesen.  Einige idiots savants koennen zahllose
Telefonnummern und komplette Reihen von Primzahlen hersagen sowie
unglaubliche Multiplikationen und Divisionen durchfuehren.  Die
Forschung kann solche Leistungen nur beobachten und festhalten.  Fuer
andere unerklaerliche Phaenomene steht uns kein Konzept zur Verfuegung:
die erstaunlichen letzten Momente vor dem Tod, die Macht der Illusion
und die Visualisierungskraft einiger Menschen.  Die Forschung hat
Erkenntnisse zur Macht des Gebets und des Glaubens und zu
paranormalen Manifestationen gesammelt.  Das vorliegende Buch will
keine Erklaerung dieser Phaenomene versuchen, sondern die umfassende
Vielfalt von Erfahrungen aufzeigen, die in die menschliche Praxis
integriert werden koennten, aber nicht werden, nur weil sie sich einer
sprachlichen Erklaerung entziehen.

In einer Welt zu funktionieren, die wir durch die Brille der
Schriftkultur lesen, macht uns oft blind fuer das, was die
Schriftkultur nicht einschliesst.  Ein Reich der Tatsachen und
moeglicher Abstraktionen, das mit der Welt des Seins, ueber die die
Sprache berichtet, nur schwer verglichen werden kann, bleibt noch zu
erforschen.  Als Richard Feynman, Nobelpreistraeger der Physik, ueber
den Unterschied zwischen maschinellem und menschlichem Rechnen
berichtete, wies er auf Aspekte hin, fuer die die Sprache als
nuetzliche Schnittstelle nicht geeignet ist, bis hin zu einem Bereich,
der sich der sprachlichen Darstellung entzieht.

Krisen, Katastrophen und Zusammenbrueche zeigen die Grenzen eines
gegebenen pragmatischen Kontextes auf.  Sie geben Hinweise auf das
Ausmass, das ein solcher Kontext haben kann.  Jenseits dieses
Kontextes beginnt das Universum des grundlegenden Umbruchs und der
Revolution.  Die wirklich interessante Ebene der Sprache und anderer
Zeichensysteme ist nicht die Bezugsebene, sondern die Ebene, aus der
neue Welten hervorgehen.  Diese neuen Welten gehen nicht unbedingt
ueber die alte hinaus.  Telecommuting ist eine Ausweitung vorheriger
Arbeitsmuster.  Kooperative Echtzeit-Erfahrungen sind mehr als die
Summe der individuellen Beitraege.  Sie sind konstitutiv fuer
nichtlineare Formen der Komplementaritaet.  Das virtuelle Buero ist
auch nur eine andere Art von Buero.  Die virtuelle Gemeinschaft ist
eine konstitutive Erfahrung.  Das Ziel liegt nicht darin, zu
informieren, sondern neue Moeglichkeiten und Kraefte zu schaffen.  Die
ausgekluegelte Kombination von Chemikalien, die man fuer wirksame
Arzneimittel, Baumaterialien oder elektronische Komponenten ersann,
setzt fruehere Muster fort.  Atomare Manipulation mit dem Ziel,
intelligente Materialien und selbstregenerierende Substanzen und
Mittel herzustellen, stellt einen weiteren neuen Bereich praktischer
Erfahrungen dar.

Jedes dieser Beispiele gehoert in einen pragmatischen Rahmen, der sich
in seiner Natur von dem unterscheidet, der die Schriftkultur
bestimmte und den die Schriftkultur nunmehr unserer Erfahrung
aufzwingt.  Viele Formen des Zentrismus, ob nun Euro-, Ethno-,
Techno- oder irgendeine andere Form, sowie des Dualismus--gut und
schlecht, richtig und falsch, gerecht und ungerecht, schoen und
haesslich--und der Hierarchie haben ihre Moeglichkeiten erschoepft.  Der
Versuch, die neue Pragmatik an Idealen zu messen, die sich nicht aus
ihr heraus entwickelt haben, kann nur zu leeren Phrasen fuehren.  Wenn
wir das Vermaechtnis der Sprache am UEbergangspunkt von
schriftgebundenem zu schriftlosem Sprachgebrauch betrachten, dann
sehen wir nicht nur Errungenschaften, sondern auch eine Diskrepanz
zwischen dem, was die Welt ist, und den Beschreibungen von der Welt
in unseren Koepfen und Buechern.  Dinge sind real, soweit sie
versprachlicht wurden.  Diese Auffassung zu ueberwinden, ist eine
Herausforderung, die ueber die Kraft der meisten Menschen hinausgeht.
Aus dem neuen pragmatischen Rahmen der distribuierten Praxis und der
kooperativen, parallelen menschlichen Interaktionen tritt ein Mensch
hervor, der sich in der Pluralitaet voneinander abhaengiger Ausdrucks-,
Kommunikations- und Bedeutungsmittel konstituiert.  Wir koennten auf
der Schwelle zu einem neuen Zeitalter stehen.



Kapitel 2:


Eine Vorstellung von der Zukunft

Fuer viele von uns ist der Bereich jenseits der Schriftkultur der
Bereich der Sciencefiction.  Die Bezeichnung Jenseits der
Schriftkultur kann auch nur die Richtung anzeigen und einige
Wegzeichen benennen.  Der Reichtum und die Vielfalt dieses Bereiches
deutet dabei die Natur an, die unsere praktischen Erfahrungen im
Verlauf unserer Selbstkonstituierung angenommen haben.  Sofern
bezueglich der erkennbaren Wegweiser Ungewissheit besteht, so gibt es
doch an einem nicht den geringsten Zweifel: an der digitalen
Grundlegung unseres pragmatischen Handlungsrahmens.  Das soll
indessen nicht heissen, dass der gegenwaertige Umbruch allein auf den
Siegeszug des Digitalen oder auch nur auf den allgemeinen Siegeszug
der Technologie zurueckgefuehrt werden kann.

Wir haben die Vorstellung von einem einzigen beherrschenden
Zeichensystem--der Sprache in ihrer schriftkulturellen Ausformung--in
Frage gestellt und zugleich vermerkt, dass eine Vielzahl
unterschiedlicher Zeichenprozesse die Notwendigkeit und Legitimation
der Schriftkultur im Zusammenhang hoeherer Effizienzerwartungen
erkennbar ueberfluegelt hat.  Wir koennten das Stadium jenseits der
Schriftkultur allerdings auch als ein semiotisches Stadium bezeichnen,
in dem Sinne, dass die menschlichen Erfahrungen zunehmend Gegenstand
von Zeichenprozessen werden.  Die digitale Maschine ist letztendlich
eine semiotische Maschine mit einem enormen Auswurf vielfaeltiger
Zeichen.  Die Semiotik der menschlichen Erfahrung geht allerdings
ueber Computer und Symbolverarbeitung weit hinaus.

Wir haben auch zeigen koennen, dass das semiotische Bewusstsein sich in
Optionen (zwischen Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsmitteln) und
Interaktionsmustern ausdrueckt.  Aufeinanderfolgende Modetrends, die
neuen Medien, globale Interaktionen in den Netzwerken, Kooperation
und distributive Konfigurationen entwickeln alle ihre eigenen
Semiologien.  Schnittstellen sind semiotische Einheiten, mittels
derer schwierige Aspekte des Verhaeltnisses zwischen Individuen und
Gesellschaft behandelt werden.  Genauer noch, to interface,
Schnittstellen einzurichten, heisst, neue Methoden und Vorstellungen
der Kulturtechnik zu entwickeln, die von der selben Natur ist wie die
Gentechnik, wenn sie auch nicht auf den selben Mechanismen beruht,
wie uns die Verfechter der Memetik glauben machen wollen.

Das entscheidende Element in der Dynamik des Umbruchs sind jene
pragmatischen Merkmale, die den Quantensprung der Effizienz innerhalb
der neuen Skala der Menschheit moeglich machen.  Darin liegen
unvorstellbar neue Moeglichkeiten und zugleich Anlass zu Zweifel und
Sorge.  Unsere Sorge richtet sich dabei nicht so sehr auf die
toerichte und bisweilen boesartige Rhetorik gegen jegliche Technologie
und deren Missbrauch, sondern auf einen falschen Optimismus, mit dem
manch einer die Auswuechse der menschlichen Kreativitaet begleitet.
Aber angesichts der spektakulaeren Multimediaprogramme, der um sich
greifenden Erscheinungsformen der virtuellen Realitaeten, der
Genmedizin und Gentechnik, der auf Breitband vernetzten menschlichen
Interaktionen oder der weltweit gespannten Kooperationsformen zaehlt
letztlich nur eines: die enormen kognitiven Ressourcen, die in der
Form von semiotischen Ablaeufen, die nicht mehr auf Sprache und
Schriftkultur reduzierbar sind, in einem globalen Rahmen zur
Entfaltung kommen.


Kognitive Energie

Die Aufzaehlung jener nuetzlichen und fuer sehr viele Menschen
segensreichen Anwendungen, die gleichwohl von vielen Menschen
abgelehnt werden, noch bevor sie wirklich ausgereift sind, waere
endlos.  Sie alle sind erst denkbar in einer Welt jenseits der
Schriftkultur, denn sie basieren auf strukturell unterschiedlichen
Ausdrucks-, Kommunikations- und Signifikationsmitteln.  Wir haben
alle auf diese oder jene Weise erste Eindruecke von den Moeglichkeiten
dieser neuen Verfahren gewonnen: Gelaehmte koennen sich mit Hilfe von
Sensoren, die an unversehrten Nervenzentren angeschlossen sind,
wieder bewegen; an den Rollstuhl gebundene Kinder koennen unabhaengig
von der Welt, in der sie als behindert gelten, in der virtuellen
Realitaet Entfaltungsmoeglichkeiten finden; durch UEbertragung von
Verhaltensmustern der koerperlichen Welt in simulierte Welten koennen
wichtige neue Fertigkeiten entwickelt werden; Simulationen fuehren zu
erfolgreicheren Rehabilitationsformen nach Unfaellen und Krankheit; in
Japan bereiten sich die Menschen mittels virtueller Realitaet auf
Erdbeben und das richtige Verhalten in entsprechenden Notsituationen
vor; die vernetzten virtuellen Welten foerdern Interaktionen im
Bereich wissenschaftlicher, dichterischer oder kuenstlerischer
Interessen und naehren die Hoffnung auf eine neue Renaissance.

Nicht alles muss dabei virtueller Natur sein.  Active badgesTM, d. h.
aktive Namensschilder, speichern und vermitteln Daten, die die
Identitaet eines Individuums ausweisen.  Das heisst nicht nur, dass man
Personen leichter lokalisieren kann, sondern dass auch alle Formen der
Interaktion--in Form von digitalen Spuren gespeichert--als
Gedaechtnishilfe fuer Menschen und Maschinen dienen.  Auch das
Gedaechtnis nimmt digitale Formen an.  Von jemandem, der einen Raum
betritt, wird automatisch Kenntnis genommen.  Der Computer informiert
sofort darueber, wie viele Botschaften auf ihn warten und wer die
Absender sind.  Er berechnet eigenstaendig die Entfernung der Person
vom Bildschirm und bietet die Information auf eine Weise dar, dass man
sie aus der entsprechenden Entfernung sehen kann.  Er fuehrt den
Terminkalender und er erinnert selbstaendig an Termine.  Er fuehrt auf
Wunsch auch ein persoenliches Tagebuch mit allem, was notiert werden
soll: Handlungen, Gespraeche, gedankliche Notizen usw.  Diese Art der
Speicherung von Daten aus den active badges und aus Bildern, die im
Verlauf bestimmter Taetigkeiten aufgezeichnet wurden, ist weniger
aufdringlich als Sekretaerinnen oder Assistenten, die einen staendig
umgeben.  Jeglicher Datenschutz ist in jedem gewuenschten Masse
gewaehrleistet.  Ein solches Tagebuch kann auch Routineereignisse
aufzeichnen, die zunaechst irrelevant erscheinen--Bewegungsablaeufe,
Gespraeche, Essen, Trinken, Zeichnen, Entwerfen, Datenanalyse.
Verhaltensmuster, die einen besonderen emotionalen oder kognitiven
Wert haben, Angeln, Bergsteigen oder auch Tanzen oder Nichtstun
koennen je nach Bedarf aufgezeichnet werden.  Und schliesslich kann
dieses Tagebuch am Ende des Tages per e-mail an seinen Verfasser
geschickt werden.  Er kann die Ereignisse des Tages dann noch einmal
vor sich ablaufen lassen oder diejenigen Augenblicke herausfiltern,
die im Verlauf des Tages besondere Bedeutung gewonnen haben.

Natuerlich koennen wir in dieser Welt jenseits der Schriftkultur auch
kuenstlerische Erfahrungen sammeln.  Wir koennen uns eine
Shakespeare-Auffuehrung auf die Monitore unserer Augen projizieren
lassen, dort, wo die Grenzen zwischen Wirklichkeit und Fiktion
beginnen.  So bekommen wir die Inszenierung unserer Wahl oder die
Schauspieler unserer Wahl.  Wir koennen uns an die Stelle der
Schauspieler setzen und eine Rolle selbst uebernehmen.  In Sport und
Spiel wird eine aehnliche Teilnahme moeglich.  Wir koennen mit jeder
gewuenschten Person in Beziehung treten oder Kontakt aufnehmen zu
einer Gemeinschaft, zu der wir gehoeren wollen.  UEberhaupt bekommen
"Dazugehoerigkeit" und "Dabeisein" einen anderen Sinn.  Sie ergeben
sich nicht mehr zufaellig, sondern aus unserer bewussten Wahl.
Dabeisein heisst nicht mehr, nur Nachrichten und politische Ereignisse
auf dem Fernsehschirm zu sehen und dabei ein Gefuehl der Ohnmacht und
des Ausgeliefertseins zu empfinden.  Alle diese Erfahrungen koennen
sich als sehr private intensive Erfahrungen vollziehen oder als
Interaktion mit anderen, ob sie nun physisch gegenwaertig sind oder
nicht.  Die Welt anders zu sehen heisst auch, den Standpunkt eines
anderen Menschen oder einer anderen Kreatur im wahrsten Sinne des
Wortes einzunehmen.  Wie sieht ein Immigrant oder ein auslaendischer
Besucher ein bestimmtes Land?  Wie erscheint der Mensch einem Wal,
einer Biene, einer Ameise oder einem Hai?  Mit den neuen
Moeglichkeiten koennen wir uns nicht nur in die Lage, sondern in den
Koerper von Schwerbehinderten versetzen und auf diese Weise am
"eigenen Leibe" erfahren, wie sich zum Beispiel ein Blinder in
unserer gnadenlosen Welt rasender Autos und hastender Menschen
zurechtfindet.  Indem wir diese Erfahrung im Rahmen der Identitaet des
anderen nachvollziehen, lernen wir sehr viel mehr voneinander und
koennen die Moeglichkeiten und Grenzen anderer besser teilen oder
verstehen.  Im guenstigsten Falle tritt an die Stelle leerer
Sympathiebekundungen aufrichtige Solidaritaet.

Es kann gar nicht genug betont werden, wie all diese semiotischen
Mittel--Ausdrucksmittel in sehr komplexen dynamischen
Zeichensystemen--die Natur unserer individuellen Erfahrungen und
unseres gesellschaftlichen Lebens veraendern.  Alles Erdenkliche kann
gesehen, kritisiert, gefuehlt, empfunden, durchgespielt und evaluiert
werden, bevor wir es tatsaechlich produzieren.  Auch simulierte
Personen koennen mit einem active badge versehen werden und als Avatar
durch die Plaene fuer ein neues Gebaeude wandern oder auf den geplanten
Wegen einer schwierigen Gebirgsexpedition.  Ein Tagebuch der
Raumforschung ist mindestens ebenso wichtig wie das persoenliche
Tagebuch eines Menschen, der in einer Fabrik, einer Forschungseinheit
oder zu Hause arbeitet.  Bevor weitere Baeume abgeholzt, weitere
Flussbetten verlegt, Wohnsiedlungen geplant oder in irgendeinem
anderen Bereich ein neuer Weg beschritten wird, koennen wir
herausfinden, welche unmittelbaren und langfristigen Folgen sich
ergeben wuerden.

Wir koennen auch noch einen Schritt ueber die integrierte Welt der
digitalen Verarbeitung hinausgehen und hoechst komplizierte Ablaeufe
und Verfahren neuronalen Netzwerken ueberantworten, die darauf
ausgerichtet sind, Befehls-, Kontrolls-, Evaluationsfunktionen
auszufuehren.  Unvorhersehbare Situationen werden so zu
Lernerfahrungen.  Und dort, wo Menschen z. B. unter emotionaler
Belastung gelegentlich versagen, koennen neuronale Netzwerke an ihre
Stelle treten, ohne dass wir damit das Risiko des letztlich
unvorhersagbaren menschlichen Verhaltens eingehen muessen.  Ein active
badge kann mit neuronalen Netzwerkverfahren verknuepft werden, die die
oftmals verschwendeten zahlreichen Fragmentpartikel unseres Wissens
verarbeiten.  So erfahren wir mehr ueber unsere Kreativitaet und die
damit verbundenen kognitiven Prozesse.  Aus der Masse unserer
nicht-aktivierten Gedanken und Handlungen koennen wir eine Menge
zusaetzlichen Wissens beziehen.  Und die Allgegenwaertigkeit,
unbegrenzte Einsatzfaehigkeit und Unaufdringlichkeit solcher Mittel
macht sie besonders geeignet fuer medizinische Versorgung,
Kindererziehung und Altenbetreuung.  Optische Computer und
Verarbeitungsmittel fuer biologische Daten werden letztendlich unser
Verhaeltnis zu Daten und Informationsverarbeitung und die
zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen voellig neu strukturieren.  Der
einzelne Mensch wird seine individuellen Merkmale genauer erkennen
und fortentwikkeln und auf diese Weise seine Position im Netzwerk der
sozio-politischen Interaktion verbessern.

Noch immer gibt es eine Reihe von Bereichen, in denen wenige Menschen
die Entscheidungen fuer andere treffen: Wie sollen unsere Kinder
spielen?  Wie sollen sie lernen?  Welche Verhaltensregeln gelten in
Familie und Gesellschaft?  Wie versorgen wir die alten Menschen?
Welche medizinischen Eingriffe sind gerechtfertigt?  Wie definieren
wir Leben und Tod?  Die Menschen, die darueber entscheiden, ueben eine
Macht aus auf der Grundlage von Werten, die in einer hierarchisch
strukturierten Lebenspraxis entstanden sind und die wir gemeinhin mit
Schriftkultur und Bildung verbinden.  Das muss nicht zwangslaeufig so
sein, vor allem wenn wir uns vor Augen halten, welche komplexen
Fragen und Entscheidungsprozesse hinter diesen scheinbar so
offensichtlichen Fragen stehen.  Auch unser Verhaeltnis zum Leben und
zum Tod, zu Universalitaet, Dauerhaftigkeit, zu nicht-hierarchischen
Lebens- und Arbeitsformen, zu Religion und Wissenschaft, vor allem
aber zu all den anderen Menschen, die unsere Erfahrungswelt
konstituieren, wird sich veraendern.  Unser Begriff von Politik wird
neu definiert werden muessen, wenn wir die Individualitaet neu
definieren als eine durch umfangreiche Zeichensysteme konstituierte
Interaktionsinstanz, und nicht mehr nur als eine Identitaet, die sich
in einer Allgemeinheit verfluechtigt, in welcher Individualitaet
gnoseologisch aufgehoben ist.


Falsche Vermutungen

Die Geisteswissenschaften haben sich in einzelnen Faellen den
Herausforderungen gestellt, die sich aus der immer zentraleren Rolle
der Naturwissenschaften und der damit einhergehenden Marginalisierung
der schriftkulturell bezogenen Geisteswissenschaften ergeben.  Dies
geschieht nicht ohne das entsprechende Selbstbewusstsein und nicht
ohne eine provokante Note.  So behauptet George Steiner, dass kein
Forschungsergebnis der Genetik an das heranreicht, was Proust ueber
den Zauber oder die Last von Abstammung und Blutsverwandtschaft zu
sagen hat.  Eine solche Feststellung ist weder wahr noch falsch, denn
es gibt fuer sie keine objektiven Kriterien.  Eine solche Feststellung
besagt lediglich, dass in Steiners Lebenspraxis nicht die Pragmatik
der Genetik, sondern die Pragmatik der Literatur und
Literaturwissenschaft die zentrale Rolle spielt.  Diese Tatsache ist
nicht zu widerlegen und ihr ist nichts hinzuzufuegen.  Aber abgesehen
davon heisst das keineswegs, dass fuer die Mehrheit der Menschen, die
vermutlich nie etwas von der Genetik verstehen werden, diese nicht
doch erhebliche Folgen hat.  Wir koennten weitere Beispiele anfuehren.
Der Hinweis, dass Othellos Worte ueber die vom Tau rostigen, blanken
Schwerter uns mehr ueber die sinnliche, vergaengliche Wirklichkeit
erfahren lassen als die Physik es je wollte und koennte, entbehrt
nicht einer gewissen rhetorischen Eleganz, verkennt aber die Tatsache,
dass die physikalischen Berechnungen ueber die ersten Minuten oder
Sekunden bei der Entstehung des Universums ebenso metaphysisch und
bewegend sind wie irgendein Beispiel aus den Kuensten oder der
Philosophie.  Die Naturwissenschaften sind lediglich von
unterschiedlichen Erkenntnisinteressen geleitet und druecken sich in
einer jeweils anderen Sprache aus.  Als solche sind sie jedoch eine
Herausforderung fuer jegliches Denken und Empfinden und fuer die Art
und Weise, wie wir uns unserer selbst und anderer, wie wir uns des
Raumes und der Zeit bewusst werden; sie stellen somit auch eine
Herausforderung fuer die Literatur dar, deren Entwicklung im uebrigen
in dem Masse zu stagnieren scheint, indem sich das Potential der
Schriftkultur erschoepft hat.  Sie muss sich fragen lassen, inwieweit
diese Art des Schreibens den neuen Erfahrungen von
Selbstkonstituierung und Identitaetsfindung in dem heutigen Stadium
jenseits der Schriftkultur noch gerecht wird.  Wie lassen sich solche
Fragen ueberhaupt beantworten?  Gar nicht oder ganz einfach: Das
Ausmass, in dem irgend etwas--Kunst, Arbeit, Wissenschaft, Politik,
Sexualitaet, Familie--etwas bedeutet, ergibt sich aus den Formen der
Selbstkonstituierung, die der Mensch findet, und kann von nichts
durch aussen diktiert werden, nicht einmal durch unsere humanistische
Tradition.  Die Luft, ob sauber oder verschmutzt, ist wichtig, soweit
sie zur Lebenserhaltung beitraegt.  Homer, Proust, Van Gogh, Beethoven
oder auch der unbekannte Kuenstler eines afrikanischen Stammes sind
alle wichtig, sofern sie Teil einer bestimmten Form menschlicher
Selbstsetzung sind.  Menschen erfahren und bestimmen ihre natuerliche
Wirklichkeit, indem sie ihre biologische Anlage in die Welt
hineinprojizieren--wir alle atmen, sehen, hoeren, benutzen unsere
Koerperkraft und erkennen die Welt.  Die Erfahrung der
Selbstkonstituierung kann sich in ganz einfachen Formen, etwa der
Nahrungsoder der Schutzsuche, vollziehen oder sehr komplex
verlaufen--durch das Komponieren oder den Genuss einer Symphonie,
eines Bildes, eines literarischen Werkes oder aber auch durch
Nachdenken ueber die eigene Lage.  Und wenn man fuer diese Erfahrung
einen Stein oder einen Stock benoetigt, ein Geraeusch, einen Rhythmus,
oder wenn sich das Individuum in eine Plastik oder ein Musikstueck
hineinprojiziert, dann ist die Bedeutung eines jeden solchen
Elementes durch den pragmatischen Zusammenhang im Vollzug der
Selbstkonstituierung bestimmt.

Es gibt zahlreiche Zusammenhaenge, aus denen auch die Bedeutung von
Erfahrungen hervorgeht, die auf der Schriftkultur basieren.
Geschichte zum Beispiel, auch in den rechnergestuetzten oder
genetischen Formen, gehoert zweifellos dazu.  Eine Reihe auch heute
wichtiger praktischer Erfahrungen ist aus der Schriftkultur erwachsen:
Bildung und Ausbildung, die Massenmedien, politische Arbeit und
industrielle Produktionsweisen.  Das heisst aber nicht, dass diese
Bereiche auf ewig an die Schriftkultur gebunden sein muessen.
Wichtige, noch heute bedeutsame Formen der Lebenspraxis, wie z. B.
das Handwerk, sind der Schriftkultur vorausgegangen.
Informationsverarbeitung, Visualisierung nichtalogorithmischer
Rechenverfahren, Genetik und Simulation sind ebenfalls aus einer
Pragmatik heraus entstanden, die an die Schriftkultur gebunden war.
Gleichwohl sind sie relativ unabhaengig von ihr.  Einer anderen
Feststellung George Steiners wollen wir zustimmen, naemlich, dass wir
die Moeglichkeit in Betracht ziehen muessen, dass die Beschaeftigung mit
Literatur zukuenftig eher von marginaler Bedeutung sein wird, ein
wichtiger Luxus wie die Bewahrung des Alten.  Nur muessen wir seine
These von der Literatur auf die gesamte Schriftkultur ausweiten.

Die Einsicht, dass wir die Schriftkultur hinter uns lassen muessen,
kann sich nur muehsam durchsetzen und steht durchaus im Widerspruch
zum gegenwaertigen modus operandi jener Wissenschaftler und Paedagogen,
die fest in der Schriftkultur und in der Tradition verwurzelt sind,
so sehr, dass sie den Verlust der Schriftkultur mit dem Verlust der
fundamentalen Dimension des Menschen gleichsetzen.  Sie gehen
faelschlicherweise davon aus, dass der Erfahrungsbereich der Sprache
identisch mit dem der Schriftkultur ist.  Wir wissen, dass das nicht
stimmt.  Muendlichkeit, die heutzutage viel wichtiger ist, als es die
Mehrheit von uns realisiert, und darueber hinaus in vielen Sprachen
ohne ein Schriftsystem fungiert, bildet die Grundlage sehr
ausdrucksreicher und vielfaeltiger Erfahrungen in der heutigen Welt.

Seit den fruehen Argumenten der Antike gegen die Schriftlichkeit ist
immer wieder Kritik an den beengenden Auswirkungen der Schriftkultur
vorgebracht worden, die, so die Argumentation, die zahlreichen
Dimensionen der Sprachen beschraenkt, indem sie den Menschen
regelhafte Verwendung aufzwingt.  Auch hier koennen wir Steiners
pluralistischer Ansicht folgen, derzufolge die Sprachmatrix
keineswegs die einzige Form sein muessen in der sich geistige Arbeit
vollzieht und artikuliert.  Ikonen und Musik dienen ihm als Beispiele
fuer eine auf Geist und Empfindungen gruendende Wirklichkeit, die
andere kommunikative Energien freisetzt.  Er erinnert daran, wie sich
unter dem Einfluss Leibniz’ und Newtons die Mathematik als eine eigene
dynamische Sprache entwickelt hat, die es Mathematikern
unterschiedlicher Kulturkreise ohne Kenntnis der jeweiligen anderen
Sprache ermoeglicht, mit Hilfe ihrer mathematischen Symbole,
gewissermassen in stiller Kommunikation, gemeinsam zu arbeiten.


Netzwerke kognitiver Energie

Chemie, Physik, Biologie und eine ganze Reihe anderer
Erfahrungsbereiche haben ihre eigene Sprache entwickelt.  Das
Ausdrucksmedium, innerhalb dessen sich eine bestimmte Erfahrung
ergibt und aeussert, ist nicht bloss deren passive Ausdruckskomponente;
es weist vielmehr durch alle seine Merkmale die Notwendigkeit auf,
mit der es aus der spezifischen Erfahrung heraus entstanden und daher
zugleich ein konstitutiver Bestandteil dieser Erfahrung geworden ist.
Das gilt fuer alle Sprachen und fuer alle Entwicklungsstufen der
einzelnen Sprachen.  Dementsprechend tragen alle Entwicklungsstadien
der Schrift ihre eigenen Charakteristika und verfolgen
unterschiedliche Funktionen.

Alle Merkmale, die wir mit Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur
verbinden, kennzeichnen eine Grundstruktur praktischer Erfahrungen,
Werte und Sehnsuechte, die in der Druckmaschine verkoerpert sind.
Linearitaet und Sequentialitaet sind die Modi des Maschinenzeitalters,
denen auch die Schriftkultur unterworfen ist: als Sprachmaschine, die
den Sprachgebrauch vereinheitlicht.  Der sequentielle Modus wird auch
fuer elaboriertere Arbeitszusammenhaenge wie etwa fuer
vollautomatisierte Produktionsketten kennzeichnend bleiben.
Gleichwohl werden sich daneben auch Parallelfunktionen durchsetzen.
Handlungsablaeufe aehnlicher und unterschiedlicher Art, die sich
gleichzeitig an verschiedenen Orten vollziehen, unterscheiden sich
qualitativ von sequentiellen Taetigkeiten.  Die sich daraus ergebenden
veraenderten Bedingungen der Selbstkonstituierung setzen neue
kognitive Merkmale und entsprechend neue, effizientere kognitive
Ressourcen frei.  In der deterministischen Komponente, die wir aus
den schriftkulturell bestimmten Erfahrungen in unsere Zeit hinueber
genommen haben, spiegelt sich unser Denkund Erfahrungsmuster von
Aktion und Reaktion, Ursache und Wirkung.  Dieser dualistische
Grundzug setzt sich fort in den Unterscheidungen unseres
Sprachgebrauchs zwischen richtig und falsch und in der dazugehoerigen
Logik.

Eine ganze Reihe unserer pragmatischen Effizienzerwartungen muendete
auch in den Versuch, eben diesen deterministischen Denk- und
Arbeitsmodus zusammen mit Linearitaet, Sequentialitaet und Dualismus zu
ueberwinden.  Eine neue Grundstruktur fuehrt zu einer durch
nicht-lineare Relationen, durch eine andere Dynamik, durch
Konfigurationen und Systeme mehrwertiger Logik ausgewiesenen
Pragmatik, die Zentralismus und Hierarchien durch (Um-) Verteilung
der Aufgaben und nicht-hierarchische Interaktionsformen ersetzt.  Die
weltweite Vernetzung verleiht ihr globale Dimensionen, wobei die neue,
integrative Rolle der Vermittlung die Effektivitaet dieser
Lebenspraxis entscheidend erhoeht.  Anstelle der tradierten
analytischen Strategien setzen sich dadurch aber auch
synthetisierende Ansaetze zu einer Gesamtschau aller partikularen
Hypothesen durch.  All das laeuft auf eines hinaus: Die
Weiterentwicklung von Computern in Leistungsfaehigkeit und Design,
ihre Produktion, Distribution und vor allem ihre Integration in unser
Leben; die Anwendungsbereiche reichen dabei von der simplen
Datenverwaltung zur hochentwickelten Simulation, und dies stets vor
einem globalen Horizont.

Die kluegsten Koepfe aus vielen Laendern sind heute an der Entwicklung
von neuen Rechnerkonzepten beteiligt.  Viele unterschiedliche
Berufsfelder tragen zur Entwicklung von Computern bei, Maschinenbau,
Chipdesign, Betriebssysteme, Telekommunikation, Ergonomie,
Interfacedesign, Produktdesign und Kommunikationsforschung.  Die
Leistungsskala unterscheidet sich dabei von allem, was wir bislang
kennengelernt haben.  Bevor ein solcher Computer als Hardware und als
Software auf unseren Schreibtischen landet, sind alle seine
Funktionen modelliert, simuliert und schliesslich getestet worden; er
verkoerpert zahllose Hypothesen und Ziele, die im neuen Produkt zu
einer leistungsfaehigen Synthese zusammengefuegt worden sind.

Fuer die neue Pragmatik jenseits der Schriftkultur wird die
Digitalisierung zu einer zentralen Ressource, so wie Elektrizitaet und
andere traditionelle Ressourcen in der Vergangenheit zur Steigerung
menschlicher Effizienz angezapft wurden.  Die Digitalisierung wird in
den kommenden Jahren unser Leben bestimmen.  So wie die Industrie im
Industriezeitalter bestrebt war, jeden Haushalt mit Autos und anderem
Geraet auszustatten, so moechte sie heute auf jedem Schreibtisch einen
Computer sehen.  Die Prioritaet sollte aber nicht darin liegen,
jedermann mit Geraeten auszustatten, sondern jedem einen Zugang zu den
Computerressourcen zu verschaffen.  Und diejenigen, die sich mit dem
Internet und dem World Wide Web noch nicht haben anfreunden koennen,
sollten sich darueber klar werden, dass sie nicht etwa wegen ihres
Surfingpotentials oder ihrer enormen Publikationsmoeglichkeiten so
vielversprechend sind, sondern als Zugang zu kognitiven Energien, die
ueber das Netzwerk transportiert werden.


Unebenheiten und Schlagloecher

Mit neuen Moeglichkeiten stellen sich auch neue Risiken ein.  Zu Fuss
zu gehen ist weniger riskant als zu reiten, Fahrrad oder Auto zu
fahren.  Mit dem Flugzeug koennen wir uns zu jedem Punkt auf dem
Erdball bringen lassen, aber damit sind wieder groessere Risiken
verbunden.  Die von uns neu erschlossenen kognitiven Ressourcen sind
effizienter als Wasserkraft, Dampfmaschine und Strom; aber in dem
Masse, in dem wir sie in unsere Lebenspraxis integrieren, nehmen wir
entsprechende Unwaegbarkeiten in Kauf.  Simulierungen komplexer und
waghalsiger Projekte lassen sich nicht mit Staedtebauprojekten oder
massiven technischen Eingriffen in die Natur vergleichen, wie sie
unter kognitiven Voraussetzungen von geringerer Komplexitaet in
vergangenen Zeiten durchgefuehrt worden sind.  Natuerlich sind nicht
zustande kommende Verbindungen im Internet oder entsprechende
Stoerungen im World Wide Web in den Anfangsstadien zu erwarten und
ganz normal.  Wir sollten indes auch niemals vergessen, dass kognitive
Zusammenbrueche sehr viel mehr bedeuten als den Zusammenbruch eines
Betriebssystems oder einer Anwendung im Netz, und dass sie
entsprechende Folgen zeitigen.

Bei der Entwicklung der neuen Sprachen in den verschiedenen
wissenschaftlichen Disziplinen und den Kuensten lernen wir mehr ueber
uns, als wir in der gesamten bisherigen Menschheitsgeschichte gelernt
haben.  Diese Sprachen verbinden das in diesen Bereichen akkumulierte
Wissen mit unseren genetisch angelegten, auf Intellekt und Emotion
gruendenden kognitiven Prozessen.  Die damit einhergehenden
Veraenderungen im allgemeinen Zuschnitt des Menschen spiegeln sich in
seinen verbesserten Faehigkeiten im Umgang mit Abstraktionen, in der
fortschreitenden Verlagerung von Unmittelbarkeit auf Vermittlung und
in neuen zwischenmenschlichen Verpflichtungen, die sich aus bislang
unerreichten Ausdrucks-, Kommunikations- und Bezeichnungsmitteln
ergeben.

Im Verlauf dieser Entwicklung wurden uns zugleich ernsthafte Grenzen
aufgezeigt.  Zwar hat sich unser Wissen erweitert und vertieft,
gleichzeitig ist es aber auch fuer den einzelnen zusammenhangloser
geworden.  Die von uns entwickelte Effizienz setzt uns auch
Bedrohungen aus, die mehr an die primitiven Stadien des Menschen als
an die vermeintlichen geistigen Errungenschaften anknuepfen.  Die
neuen Moeglichkeiten veraendern Politik und Wirtschaft, vor allem
anderen veraendern sie jedoch die Natur menschlicher Beziehungen und
Transaktionen.  Und sie veraendern unser Zukunftsverstaendnis.

Orwells Big Brother ist weiterhin allgegenwaertig, allerdings in einem
anderen Sinn, als Orwell ihn verstand.  In den sich abzeichnenden
Interaktionsstrukturen koennen sich Kontroll- und
Unterdrueckungsmechanismen nicht so durchsetzen wie in zurueckliegenden
Gesellschaftsformen.  Nicht unsere Begeisterung fuer das Internet,
sondern dessen Natur konstituiert einen nicht kontrollierten,
herrschaftsfreien Handlungsrahmen; es laesst sich einfach nicht wie
unsere Fahr-, Trink- und Lebensgewohnheiten ueberwachen.  Wir koennen
uns gar nicht leisten, die in den jenseits schriftkultureller
Dominanz entwickelten Systemen angelegte Transparenz zu
vernachlaessigen oder zu missbrauchen.  Einige Parameter koennen wir
beeinflussen, nicht aber ihr globales Funktionieren.  Die durch die
parallel verlaufenden, hochspezialisierten und verzweigten
Arbeitsablaeufe erforderliche Integration koennte sich in einem
vernetzten System, das durch alle moeglichen Kontrollfilter und
Vertraulichkeitsnischen behindert ist, gar nicht entfalten.  Das waere
so, als muessten wir bei jeder koerperlichen Taetigkeit den einzelnen
Gliedmassen und Organen des Koerpers eine Einsatzerlaubnis erteilen.
Im neuen pragmatischen Zusammenhang uebernehmen die einzelnen
Individuen dieselbe Funktion von Gliedern und Organen, deren
individuellen Beitraege sich zu einem grossen Zusammenhang fuegen.
Darin liegt eine enorme Leistung, die auch nicht immer so ergiebig
und befriedigend ist, wie wir es erwarten, und die sich in ihrer
Komplexitaet dem einzelnen fast immer entzieht.  Feedback ist zwar ein
sichtbarer, nicht aber der wesentliche Teil dieses Systems.

Die Authentizitaet einer jeder unserer Handlungen traegt zur Integritaet
des gesamten Prozesses bei.  Damit verbunden ist jedoch eine gewisse
Insularisierung und eine Entfremdung vom Ganzen und vom
uebergeordneten Ziel: hoehere Erwartungen durch groessere Leistungen zu
erfuellen.  Andererseits sehen wir uns mit einer ganz neuen Art der
Selbstbestimmung und mit neuen Interaktionsformen versehen, die viel
menschlicher sein koennen als die Lebens- und Arbeitsbedingungen des
Industriezeitalters, in dem der einzelne Mensch ameisengleich
zwischen Wohnung und Arbeitsplatz, Einkaufszentrum und
Freizeitbeschaeftigung pendelte.  Kein Big Brother wacht ueber uns,
jeder einzelne ist auf gleiche Weise eingebunden und findet jeden
gewuenschten Zugang zu allen Teilen des Systems.  Ohne Transparenz
waere das gar nicht zu bewerkstelligen.  Damit aber koennen und muessen
wir auch jederzeit unseren Beitrag zum Ganzen ueberpruefen.  Es waere
oft bequemer, sich einer vorgegebenen Autoritaet zu unterwerfen, als
sich durch die Feedback-Mechanismen vor sich selbst verantworten und
die eigene Leistung bestaendig ueberpruefen zu muessen.  Die Last der
Verantwortung ist von Big Brother, von buerokratischen Instanzen und
Gaengelungen auf jeden einzelnen uebergegangen.

Es erscheint nunmehr ratsam, fuer einige wichtige, durch diese
Veraenderungen besonders betroffenen Bereiche die notwendigen
Handlungsmassnahmen zu skizzieren.  Wenn die an Schriftkultur und
schriftkultureller Bildung orientierten Formen unserer Erziehung und
Ausbildung nicht mehr leistungsfaehig sind, dann bedarf es neuer, in
die Zukunft gerichteter Haltungen und Einstellungen und konkreter
Entwuerfe, die sich in voller Kenntnis der tragenden
Entwicklungskraefte den Herausforderungen stellen.


Die Universitaet des Zweifels

Schriftkulturell gebundene Erziehung geht wie alle anderen auf der
Schriftkultur gruendenden Taetigkeiten davon aus, dass alle Menschen
gleich sind und dass jeder lesen und schreiben koennen muss.  Wie die
industrielle Produktionsweise auf standardisierte Produkte abzielte,
unterzog die Erziehung den Menschen einer Standardisierung, indem sie
ihn in die Gussform schriftkultureller Bildung zwaengte.  Zeugnisse
belegen das Ausmass der Annaeherung an diesen Standard.  Lese-,
Schreib- und Rechenschwierigkeiten werden als krankhafte Abweichungen
behandelt.  Warum wir aber uniforme kognitive Strukturen beim
schriftlichen Gebrauch von Sprache und Zahlen voraussetzen, nicht
aber beim Gebrauch von Geraeuschen, Farben und Formen, wird niemals
hinterfragt.  Mit enormem Aufwand widmen wir uns denen, die die
Sequentialitaet des Schreibens nicht beherrschen oder die Bedeutung
von Zahlenreihen nicht verstehen.  Den kognitiven Merkmalen von
Menschen, die in nichtschriftlichen Zeichensystemen besser zu Hause
sind, schenken wir hingegen nicht die geringste Beachtung.

Unser Erziehungssystem muss das Individuum mit seinem umfangreichen
Repertoire kognitiver Merkmale wiederentdecken.  Mit wiederentdecken
meine ich ganz urspruengliche Erziehungsmassnahmen in Einzel- oder
Kleingruppen.  Auch muesste die Erziehung ihre am industriellen Modell
der Standardisierung orientierte Grundvoraussetzung, die von einem
gemeinsamen Nenner jeglicher Erziehung ausgeht, ueberpruefen.  Statt zu
zaehmen und vermeintlich Krankes zu heilen, sollten Unterschiede in
Faehigkeiten und Interessenlagen nicht nur gelten bleiben, sondern
gefoerdert werden.  Jede bekannte Energieform ist Ausdruck von
Differenz, nicht das Ergebnis von Gleichschaltung.

Zu der Neubesinnung auf die Aufgaben der Erziehung gehoert auch, dass
ihre Methoden und Inhalte ueberdacht werden.  Visuelle, akustische,
kinetische und synaesthetische Phaenomene muessen einbezogen werden und
neben allem anderen ein guenstiges Umfeld fuer Interaktion und
Entdeckung schaffen.  Die Zeit, die heute fuer die Aufarbeitung des
Vergangenen aufgewendet wird, sollte zumindest auch genutzt werden,
um den Bezug zur Gegenwart und, wenn moeglich, zur Zukunft
herzustellen.

Die Grunderziehung sollte sich den wesentlichen Ausdrucks- und
Kommunikationsformen widmen, die Unterschiede zwischen den jeweiligen
Zeichensystemen hervorheben und alle an diese Systeme und an deren
sinnvolle Verknuepfungen heranfuehren.  Die Einuebung in diese
Zeichensysteme kann nur ueber deren praktischen Gebrauch geschehen,
nicht ueber Anweisungen und theoretisch ersonnene UEbungen.  Im
konkreten Umgang mit ihnen kann der Schueler erfahren, wie sie
anzuwenden sind; richtige und falsche Antworten ergeben sich aus den
jeweiligen pragmatischen Kontexten ihrer Verwendung.  Gemeinsames
Lernen in Form von Zusammenarbeit und Erfahrungsaustausch steht im
Vordergrund.

Ein fundamentales paedagogisches Prinzip muss dabei die heuristische
Suche sein, die sich in Programmen fuer weitergehende Untersuchungen
ausdrueckt.  Solche Programme haben viele Sprachen: Schriftlichkeit,
Mathematik, Chemie, computergestuetztes Rechnen usw.  Da Menschen
unterschiedlichster Herkunft in die Lernprozesse eingebunden sind,
bringen sie die Erfahrungen ihrer jeweiligen Sprachen mit ein.
Welcher Zugang zu einem gegebenen Problem dabei der richtige ist,
ergibt sich aus der Relevanz fuer die jeweils gestellte Aufgabe.
Dabei wird vermutlich nicht selten das Rad neu erfunden.  Aber auch
das Gegenteil wird denkbar: die freigelegte authentische Kreativitaet
und der gefoerderte Erfindungsreichtum koennen durchaus zur Entdeckung
neuer Raeder fuehren.  Die an solchen Lernprozessen teilhabenden
Schueler teilen ihre Erfahrungen miteinander und finden so Zugang zu
den vielfaeltigen Perspektiven der Beteiligten und damit zur Vielfalt
der Menschen.


Interaktives Lernen

Erziehung, Bildung und Ausbildung muessen lebendige Prozesse sein, die
den Zugang zu allen Informationsquellen garantieren, nicht nur zu
denen im Schriftformat.  Jede Informationsquelle hat ihre eigene
epistemologische Voraussetzung--eine gedruckte Enzyklopaedie
unterscheidet sich von einer elektronischen Datenbank.  Die Lektuere
eines Buches ist etwas anderes als der Umgang mit einer multimedialen
Plattform.  Diese Unterschiede stellen sich bei der Verwendung ein,
nicht im passiven Erlernen oder durch Nachahmung.  Das Erziehungsziel
darf nicht darin liegen, Verhaltensmuster nachzuahmen, sondern Wissen
und Faehigkeiten in Vorgaengen und konkreten Handlungsablaeufen zu
erwerben.  Nach diesem Erziehungsmodell setzen sich Klassen aus
Interessengruppen mit gemeinsamen Zielen zusammen, sie sind nicht
durch Altersstufen, festgelegte Faecher oder gar durch
verwaltungstechnische Prinzipien definiert.  Der Klassenraum ist die
Welt, nicht ein aus Ziegelsteinen und Moertel umgrenzter Raum, in dem
stereotype Rollen und Beziehungen eingeuebt werden.  Das mag alles
vielleicht etwas unueberlegt oder ueberzogen klingen, aber die Mittel
zur Verwirklichung solcher Erziehungsideale stehen zur Verfuegung.

Wir koennen uns folgendes Szenarium vorstellen: Nach einer ersten
Grunderziehungsphase besuchen die Schueler interaktive Bildungszentren.
Dabei soll der Begriff des Zentrums keineswegs an schriftkulturelle
Bildungsmerkmale anschliessen.  Diese Zentren sind vielmehr
Sammelpunkte fuer die vielfaeltigen Wissensrepositorien--Datenbaenke,
Programme zur Erprobung unterschiedlichster Erfahrungsbereiche,
Beispiele und Evaluationsmassnahmen.  Diese Zentren offerieren
jederzeit modifizierbares und ergaenzungsfaehiges Wissen in allen
erdenklichen Formaten.  Auf Wunsch koennen eigens dafuer entwickelte
Programme (sogenannte intelligent agents) entsprechende
Wissensquellen erschliessen, sei es mit Hilfe derer, die ihrer
beduerfen, unabhaengig von oder parallel zu ihnen.  Der Wunsch kann
muendlich artikuliert werden ("Ich wuesste gern..."), handschriftlich,
maschinell oder graphisch.  Interaktive Bildungszentren vereinigen
die Funktionen von Buechereien, heuristischen Erprobungsfeldern,
Laboratorien, Testverfahren und Forschungsmedien.  Die hybride
Maschine aus menschlichen Individuen und Funktionen, die den Kern
eines solchen Zentrums ausmacht, veraendert sich in dem Masse, in dem
das in die Interaktion verwobene Individuum sich aendert.

Wir alle wissen, dass das Lehren die beste Art des Lernens ist.  Daher
sollten die an das neuronale Netzwerk angeschlossenen Teilnehmer ihre
Partner an ihren Erfahrungen teilhaben lassen, soweit diese deren
eigene Interessengebiete beruehren.  Die miteinander verbundenen
neuronalen Netzwerke selbst werden ihrerseits zu Partnern bei der
Verfolgung von immer komplexeren Zielen.  Und da die Kriterien, nach
denen sich die Interaktionspartner finden, nicht durch Wohnort und
Schulbezirk, Alter oder Herkunft, sondern allein durch gemeinsame
Interessen und unterschiedliche Perspektiven bestimmt sind, gewinnt
dieser neue Bildungstypus auch eine erhebliche soziale Bedeutung:
Alles was wir tun, wirkt sich auf die gesamte Welt aus.

In unserem Modell werden gemeinsame Interessen verfolgt, Ergebnisse
verglichen, Fragen verbreitet.  Auf diese Weise eignet man sich
Denkweisen an, lernt Hypothesen zu ueberpruefen und Fortschritte
festzustellen.  Lehrer und Erzieher koennen sich frei von
Verwaltungspflichten auf die entscheidenden Lernprozesse
konzentrieren; statt immer wieder Vergangenes aufzuarbeiten,
entwickeln sie Interaktionsmoeglichkeiten, in denen sich die Schueler
lernend entfalten.  Auch die Lehrer werden in den Interaktionsprozess
einbezogen, sind an der allmaehlichen Entwicklung des Wissens
beteiligt und entwickeln sich damit selbst weiter.  Sie bleuen ihren
Schuelern nicht die Disziplin einer beherrschenden Sprache ein,
sondern oeffnen Wahlmoeglichkeiten fuer kurz- oder laengerfristiges
Engagement.

Und wenn die Schueler nicht mehr eine verbindliche Sprache
aufoktroyiert bekommen, sind sie auch von den Fesseln aufgetragener
UEbungspflichten befreit.  Sie treffen ihre eigene Wahl und uebernehmen
damit ein hohes Mass an Selbstverantwortung.  Dabei werden
Unterschiede zwischen den Schuelern zutage treten, aber gleichzeitig
wird auch die Einsicht geschaerft, dass bei kooperativer Interaktion
das Anderssein ein hohes Gut und kein Nachteil ist.  Das Erlebnis,
Eigenes zu entdecken und sich in grosse Zusammenhaenge kooperativ
einbinden zu koennen, praktische Erfahrungen nicht im Lernspiel
nachzuahmen, sondern selbst zu vollziehen, ist der beste Naehrboden
fuer motiviertes Lernen.


Die Begleichung der Rechnung

Auch die Finanzierung der Ausbildung wuerde auf neue Grundlagen
gestellt und von denen getragen, die den Nutzen daraus ziehen.  Ein
Unternehmen, das an gut ausgebildeten, am Arbeitsmarkt orientierten
Schuelern interessiert ist, duerfte dafuer ohnehin besser geeignet sein.
Auch fallen die Kosten wesentlich geringer aus, da die
Interaktionskonfigurationen weder aufwendige Schulgebaeude noch hohe
Verwaltungskosten erfordern.  Die Ausbildung wuerde sich nicht mehr an
einem fiktiven Arbeitgeber ausrichten, sie waere Teil von Industrie,
Dienstleistungsbetrieben, Behoerden und Kleinbetrieben.  Sie wuerde
sich orientieren an praktischen Erfahrungen und tatsaechlichem Bedarf,
nicht an unbestimmten Erziehungsidealen, die sich nach Abschluss einer
teueren Ausbildung als hohl und nutzlos erweisen.  Entsprechend gut
ist die Motivation der Schueler, die sich in Betriebe eingebunden
fuehlen, deren zukuenftige Bilanz von der Leistung der von ihnen
Ausgebildeten abhaengt.  Aber wird die Wirtschaft sich darauf
einlassen?  Heute sieht sie sich jedenfalls in der paradoxen
Situation, dass sie ueber eine am Berufsmarkt vorbeigehende Ausbildung
klagt, die im uebrigen viele Merkmale traegt, die auch die ueberholten,
ineffizienten Formen des Geschaeftslebens kennzeichnen.

Die Absolventen solcher Ausbildungsgaenge koennen ab einem gewissen
Kompetenz- und Selbstvertrauensgrad ihr Schicksal eigenstaendig in die
Hand nehmen, weiterfuehrende Ausbildungswege beschreiten oder im
Unternehmen, das ihre Ausbildung getragen hat, eine Aufgabe
uebernehmen.  Vor allem koennen sie die selbstgewaehlten und erprobten
kognitiven Faehigkeiten ausbauen.  Es wird analytisch oder synthetisch
orientierte Menschen geben, viele werden die erlernten Faehigkeiten
zur Bildung und Erprobung von Hypothesen erweitern.  Manche werden
ihren Neigungen zu induktivem Arbeiten folgen, empirisch arbeiten,
beobachten und daraus allgemeine Schlussfolgerungen ziehen; andere
werden das deduktive Arbeiten vorziehen, von allgemeinen
Gesetzmaessigkeiten auf konkrete Anwendungen uebergehen.  Wieder andere
werden sich mit Ableitungen beschaeftigen, das Wissen ueber einen
repraesentativen Satz von Phaenomenen auf umfangreichere
Tatsachenbestaende oder Ablaeufe uebertragen.

Keine dieser kognitiven Moeglichkeiten sollte verboten, ausgeschlossen
oder nachgeordnet werden, solange die menschliche Integritaet in allen
Aspekten gewahrt bleibt und die Interaktion von Menschen in allen
ihren denkbaren Formen ausgeuebt wird.  Unsere derzeitigen Erziehungs-
und Bildungsmethoden foerdern integritaetshemmende Motivationen; was
zaehlt, ist das fuer das Zeugnis relevante Ergebnis, ungeachtet der
Tatsache, wie es erreicht wurde und was es zur Persoenlichkeitsbildung
beitraegt.  Im gegenwaertigen Bildungssystem stellt sich Integritaet
allenfalls zufaellig ein.  Die gemeinsame Arbeit an einem Projekt
hingegen foerdert die gegenseitige Verantwortung fuer das angestrebte
Ergebnis.  Und da das Ergebnis fuer die zukuenftige Entwicklung eines
jeden Beteiligten entscheidend ist, erschoepft sich die Ausbildung
nicht mehr in Zensuren und Zeugnissen, sondern orientiert sich an der
erfolgreichen Zusammenarbeit in der Verfolgung eines gemeinsamen
Ziels.

Durch Zwang laesst sich nichts vermitteln und nichts erreichen.  Ein
bestimmter Standpunkt gegenueber einer Sache oder Werten ausserhalb des
unmittelbaren Lebenszusammenhangs werden nur in einer
lebenspraktischen Erfahrungslage als notwendig erfahren.  Wer
gezwungen wird, Daten aus Shakespeares Leben und Passagen aus seinen
Werken auswendig zu lernen, wird seine Dramen weder verstehen noch
schaetzen.  Aber ein zwangfreies Angebot von Kunst und Wissenschaft,
Sport und Unterhaltung, Politik und Religion, Ethik und
Rechtssystemen in vielfaeltigen didaktisch-methodischen Formen wie
interaktiven Medien, Buechern, Kunstwerken, Datenbaenken und
Interaktionsprogrammen bietet die Moeglichkeit eigener Entdeckungen
und Erfahrungen.  So wichtig alle genannten Bereiche sind, wir duerfen
niemals vergessen, dass Erziehung nur dann erfolgreich sein kann, wenn
sie die Schueler einigermassen gluecklich und zufrieden macht.  Jede
Erziehungsmassnahme, gut oder schlecht, greift in irgendeiner Weise in
den Menschen als eine natuerliche Einheit ein.  Das heisst, dass es im
Erziehungsprozess immer auch Spannungen geben muss; aber statt nur
diejenigen zu belohnen, die sich leichter akkulturieren lassen,
sollte die Erziehung auch komplementaere Faktoren beruecksichtigen.
Damit befuerworte ich weder interaktives Lernen am Strand oder auf dem
Skihuegel noch die totale und bedingungslose Einbindung in die
Arbeitswelt.  Aber wenn sich die Erziehung schon vom Modell
industrieller Ablaeufe loesen sollte--fabrikaehnliche Gebaeude,
Unterricht, der nach Pinzipien der Schichtarbeit und der Teilung von
Arbeit, Freizeit und Urlaub organisiert ist--, dann sollten die
Schueler den Unterrichtsrhythmus auch besser mit ihren natuerlichen
Lebensrhythmen vereinbaren koennen.  Statt staendiger physischer
Anwesenheit aller zu bestimmten Zeiten sollte sich eine interaktive
und kooperative Kreativitaet entfalten duerfen, die Raum bietet fuer das
Spielerische, Natuerliche und Zufaellige.

Das klingt vielleicht weit hergeholt, aber es liegt tatsaechlich noch
in weiter Ferne.  Selbst wenn die grossen Computerfirmen ueberall auf
der Welt Interaktionszentren einrichten wuerden, haette dies keine
weitreichenden Veraenderungen zur Folge.  Zu tief sind die
Lernhaltungen der Schueler in den traditionellen Erwartungen
verwurzelt.  Es laesst sich leichter UEbereinstimmung darueber erzielen,
was am gegenwaertigen Bildungssystem gut ist, als darueber, was
geaendert werden koennte und muesste.  Aber jeder einzelne kleine Kern
selbstorganisierten Lernens, der sich in Online-Klassen mit
netzwerkspezifischen Fragestellungen beschaeftigt, ist ein Schritt in
die richtige Richtung.  UEberall dort, wo sich der Bedarf an
qualifizierten Arbeitskraeften besonders dringlich
stellt--rechnergestuetzte Genetik, Nanotechnologie, nicht-lineares
elektronisches Publishing--, bietet das hier vorgestellte Modell eine
Chance.  Wir koennen nicht mehr erwarten, dass unser Bildungssystem
qualifizierten Nachwuchs heranbildet, ohne dass die an diesem
Nachwuchs interessierten Firmen an den Kosten dafuer beteiligt werden.
Statt Stiftungslehrstuehle fuer traditionelle Wissenschaftsdisziplinen
bereitzustellen, sollten die Unternehmen in die Ausbildung und die
lebenslange berufliche Weiterbildung investieren.

Solange wir davon ausgehen, dass nur derjenige ein guter Architekt
wird, der Geschichte, Mathematik, Biologie beherrscht und dazu noch
weiss, wer Vitruvius war, halten wir an den ueberkommenen Regeln der
Schriftkultur fest.  Die Frage ist auch falsch gestellt.  Denn sie
unterstellt, dass man im voraus wissen kann, was fuer veraenderte
pragmatische Zusammenhaenge wichtig wird und wie diese sich darstellen.
Die Inhalte veraendern sich, die Proportionen veraendern sich, vor
allem aber veraendert sich der Lebenszusammenhang.

Im Gegensatz zur heute verbreiteten Rangordnung zwischen den Faechern,
die z. B. Zeichnen und Singen zu Nebenfaechern und Lesen und
Schreiben zu Hauptfaechern erklaert, muessen wir die Komplementaritaet
der einzelnen Faehigkeiten anerkennen.  Unsere Erziehung sollte alle
die Faehigkeiten foerdern, in denen und durch die die jungen Menschen
sich in einer Welt definieren, die den Kreislauf ewiger
Wiederholungen durchbrochen hat und voellig neue, auf keine
Vergangenheit bezogenen Ziele verfolgt.  Statt Intuition und
Irrationalitaet rundweg abzulehnen, sollten auch Selbsterkundungswege
offenstehen, die sie integrieren.  Eine nur auf Problemloesung
ausgerichtete Erziehung ist zu eng; alternative Ziele, auf die auch
Intuition, Irrationalitaet oder das Unbewusste hinfuehren, sollten
erlaubt sein.


Ein Weckruf

Unser Modell vertraut bei den Schuelern auf Reife und Erfahrung und
bei den Erziehern auf die Faehigkeit, ein Unterrichtsklima zu schaffen,
in dem sich Selbstverantwortung und Selbstdisziplin entfalten koennen.
Es muss sich den bislang ungeklaerten Fragen danach stellen, wann und
mit welchen Mitteln die Ausbildung beginnt, welche Rolle die Familie
darin spielt--sofern die Familie ueberhaupt noch ein nennenswerter
Erziehungsfaktor bleibt--, wie man Vielfalt und Multiplizitaet
integrieren kann.  OEffentlichen Bekundungen nach verfolgen Erziehung
und Ausbildung einen Hauptzweck: die nachwachsenden Generationen mit
den Faehigkeiten auszustatten, die sie in die Lage versetzen, in der
Zukunft zum nationalen Wohl beizutragen.  Wenn das so ist, dann
sollte die Tatsache, dass unsere wirtschaftliche Lebensfaehigkeit von
einer globalen Wirtschaft abhaengt, die sich nicht mehr durch Landes-
und Staatsgrenzen definieren oder lenken laesst, und dass Wettbewerb
sich auf dem uebernationalen Markt abspielt, nicht unberuecksichtigt
bleiben.

Insgesamt geraet, ein wenig wohl auch in unserem Modell, die
Entfaltung des Individuums durch die Entwicklung seiner geistigen und
seelischen Faehigkeiten in Vergessenheit oder wird dem Einschaerfen von
Fakten und Fertigkeiten untergeordnet.  AEsthetische Sensibilitaet,
subtilere geistige Interessen, auch der Erfahrungsreichtum der
Gefuehlswelt, bleiben sich selbst genuegende persoenliche Interessen.
Die Menschen sehen sich einer Arbeitswelt ausgesetzt, die mit der von
Paedagogen, Wirtschaftsvertretern und Politikern antizipierten
Berufswelt wenig zu tun hat und immer fragmentarischer und
vermittelter wird.  Letztendlich wird fast jede Arbeit zu einem "Job"
statt zu einem Beruf.  AErzte, Professoren, Geschaeftsleute, Schreiner
und Fast-food-Verkaeufer ueben Taetigkeiten aus, die zumindest teilweise
automatisiert werden koennten.  Damit verliert die Arbeit ihre
wichtigste Motivationsgrundlage--die Entfaltung individueller Anlagen
zu einer persoenlichen Identitaet.  Innere Motivation wird durch aeussere
Begruendungen--die Erhaltung der kommerziellen Demokratie--ersetzt,
was schliesslich zu abnehmendem Interesse an der Arbeit, geringerem
Engagement und weniger Kreativitaet fuehrt.  Eine berufsbezogene
Ausbildung verspricht Wohlstand, nicht Selbsterfuellung.  Der Verfall
der Familie und ein neues Sexual- und Fortpflanzungsverhalten deuten
darauf hin, dass eine staerkere Einbindung der Familie in die
Bildungsverantwortung, so begruessenswert sie waere, wohl eher die
Ausnahme bleiben wird.  Es waere also geraten, dass wir uns auf die
Veraenderungen einstellen und Alternativen entwickeln, statt darauf zu
hoffen, dass durch ein Wunder oder die goettliche Intervention des
Dollars oder einer anderen starken Waehrung die Familie wieder zu dem
wird, was sie nach den Idealen der Schriftkultur haette werden sollen.

Zahlreiche Paedagogen haben Theorien zur Erziehungs- und
Bildungsreform entwickelt.  Sie ignorieren nicht etwa die neuen
pragmatischen Erfordernisse, sie werden ihrer ueberhaupt nicht gewahr.
Ihre Empfehlungen laufen daher mehr oder weniger auf dasselbe hinaus:
immer das Gleiche und davon noch mehr.

Der allgegenwaertige Fernsehapparat ist das typischste Merkmal unserer
Zeit.  Er hat laengst die Rolle uebernommen, die das Buch einmal
innehatte.  Dennoch ist das Fernsehen ein passives Medium; sein
Informationsgehalt ist trotz der gegebenen Moeglichkeiten gering.  Das
digitale Fernsehen mit der Einbeziehung des Computers wird hier
entscheidende Veraenderungen mit sich bringen; es ist ein aktives
Medium und foerdert Interaktivitaet.  Bildungszentren werden diese
Moeglichkeiten aktivieren und mit seiner Hilfe interaktive
Bildungsprozesse zwischen Individuen mit unterschiedlichstem
Bildungshintergrund ermoeglichen.  Vor allem dieses Medium wird uns
den Umgang mit unterschiedlichen Sichtweisen und Perspektiven lehren
und neue Erfahrungs- und Wissenshorizonte erschliessen.  Sie werden
weniger auf Informationsvermittlung konzentriert sein als auf das
Verstaendnis von Veraenderungen und den Prozessen, die sie herbeifuehren.

In diesem Zusammenhang hat auch die aesthetische Erfahrung einen Platz,
nicht als Kunstgeschichte, sondern als aesthetische Erwaegung und
Taetigkeit, die neben den wissenschaftlichen Kenntnissen zur
Optimierung der menschlichen Praxis beitraegt.  Wenn sich zukuenftige
Lerngruppen dynamisch zusammensetzen, werden sie nach Alter, Herkunft
und Vorbildung heterogen sein.  Angesiedelt im oeffentlichen Bereich
vernetzter Ressourcen findet jeder den Zugang zu Lerngebieten seiner
Wahl, Feedback ist jederzeit gewaehrleistet und insgesamt ein Klima
kreativen Wettbewerbs geschaffen.  Hieraus ergeben sich dann nicht
nur wissenschaftliche und technologische Leistungen, sondern
besonders auch die Relevanz aesthetischer Dimensionen.

Das schriftkulturell fixierte paedagogische Establishment wird unsere
UEberlegungen vermutlich als Wolkenkuckucksheim, bestenfalls als
futuristisch abtun.  Man wird unter Verweis auf die draengenden
Probleme Sofortloesungen fordern, keine Zukunftsmodelle, die auf
Selbstorganisation und Finanzierung durch die Wirtschaft setzen.
Zukunftsmodelle besitzen weniger UEberzeugungskraft als Plaene fuer die
Reformierung einer Bildungspraxis, die auf eine lange Tradition und
auf Leistungen in der Vergangenheit verweisen kann.  Und die
OEffentlichkeit wird trotz aller Kritik am gegenwaertigen
Bildungssystem einige Zweifel aeussern: Wie sinnvoll und serioes ist es,
angesichts von Metalldetektoren in den Schulen, die die Schueler nach
Waffen absuchen, eine neue Bildungstheorie zu entwerfen, die auf neue
Lernhaltungen abzielt?  Wie ueberzeugend sind Forderungen nach neuen
Lernerfahrungen mit hohen aesthetischen Anspruechen, wo doch gerade die
Mittelmaessigkeit fuer die prekaere Lage an unseren Schulen kennzeichnend
ist?  Aber: Sollen wir Motivation und Eigenmotivation in einer
Schulwirklichkeit, in der immer mehr Teenager schwanger zur Schule
kommen oder ihre Kinder in den Unterricht mitbringen, unterbezahlten
Lehrern oder Visionaeren ueberantworten?  Wasser in der Wueste zu
verkaufen, ist nicht so einfach, wie es vielleicht klingt.

Warum sollen wir uns nicht ausmalen, dass Lernmittel an die
Computerterminals des Kennedy Space Center oder an die Supercomputer
des European Center for Research of the Future angeschlossen werden?
Wir koennen uns durchaus vorstellen, dass wir mit digitalem Fernsehen
das uns Unbekannte erforschen oder eine Online-Ausbildung einrichten;
denn wir leben in einer Welt, in der zur Steigerung unser aller
Leistungen der Zugriff auf Ressourcen, die bislang wenigen
vorbehalten waren, immer selbstverstaendlicher wird.  Dafuer muessen wir
aber unsere hergebrachten Vorstellungen von einer homogenen,
allgemein verbindlichen Ausbildung, die alle Individuen in dieselben
Ausbildungsmuster zwaengt, ob sie wollen und koennen oder nicht,
aufgeben.  Auch die besten Vorsaetze, die soziale und ethnische
Ruecksichten nehmen und humanistische Ideale verfolgen, helfen nicht
weiter.  UEberall auf der Welt hat die Pro-Kopf-Rate der privaten und
oeffentlichen Bildungsausgaben die Inflationsrate ueberschritten;
dennoch widmen die Schueler ihre Zeit immer weniger der Schule und den
schulischen Aufgaben.  Das gilt fuer die USA ebenso wie fuer andere
Laender mit hohen Zulassungsvoraussetzungen, also etwa Frankreich,
Deutschland oder Japan.

Wir koennen also unser Bildungssystem nicht ohne Blick auf die
allgemeinen gesellschaftlichen Veraenderungen reformieren.  Es ist
nicht von den anderen gesellschaftlichen Systemen losgeloest.  Schueler,
Lehrer, Eltern, politische Institutionen, wirtschaftliche Realitaeten,
ethnische und kulturelle Voraussetzungen und die Verhaltensmuster in
unserer kommerziellen Demokratie binden es in den allgemeinen
pragmatischen Kontext ein.  Und da herrschen provinzielle Denkweisen
vor: Buerokratische Verordnungen von unuebertroffener Dummheit
unterbinden jegliche Veraenderung, die Millionen von zukuenftigen
Schuelern bessere Ausbildungschancen geben koennte.  Was sich als
Kultivierung von Geist und Seele verstanden wissen will, ist die
Hochglanzpolitur eines Ladenfensters, hinter dem nur noch Ladenhueter
verstauben.  Welcher Sinn liegt darin, Millionen von Schuelern taeglich
in Schulen zu schicken, deren Kosten wir nicht mehr tragen koennen,
und sie Leistungstests zu unterziehen, deren Massstaebe wir staendig
senken muessen?


Konsum und Interaktion

Ob wir es wollen oder nicht, die Wirtschaft wird durch Konsum
angetrieben.  Das soll nicht gleich heissen, dass wir einen
Feedback-Kreislauf beguenstigen sollen, der letztendlich die
Stabilitaet des Systems, dem wir angehoeren, unterminieren wuerde.  Wenn
aber Konsum die Hauptantriebskraft bliebe, wuerden wir uns irgendwann
alle zu Tode vergnuegen.  Die Loesung fuer unser Problem ist aber nicht
in politischen oder paedagogischen Moralpredigten zu suchen.
Schuldzuweisungen an Konsum, Wohlstandserwartungen oder
Freizeitverhalten loesen keine Bildungsprobleme.  Unsere Erziehung muss
den Konsumfaktor beruecksichtigen und gleichzeitig den gesunden
Menschenverstand foerdern.  Ein gewisses Qualitaetsbewusstsein koennen
wir schon dadurch anerziehen, dass wir kooperative Erziehungsprojekte
foerdern, die nicht nur die Produktion von Dingen, sondern auch die
eigene Weiterentwicklung in den Mittelpunkt stellen.  Den
Generationen, deren Fenster zur Wirklichkeit die Fernsehschirme
geworden sind, kann nicht zur Last gelegt werden, dass ihr Interesse
am Lesen nachgelassen hat oder dass ihnen die Wirklichkeit als eine
inszenierte Show erscheint, die durch halbminuetige Werbespots
unterbrochen wird.  Die jungen Leute von heute verfuegen ueber andere
Faehigkeiten; statt sie auszuschalten, muss unser Bildungssystem ihnen
dafuer die angemessenen Entfaltungsmoeglichkeiten bieten.  Das
Fernsehen ist eine Tatsache in unserem Leben geworden, wir muessen sie
nutzen; allerdings werden sich die Entwicklungen, die das Verhaeltnis
zwischen den Zuschauern und den Sendern von Botschaften veraendern,
auch auf die Wirklichkeit des Fernsehens auswirken.

Kognitive und motorische Merkmale von Fernsehzuschauern unterscheiden
sich von denen, die sich unter der Schiftkultur herausgebildet haben.
Und das digitale Fernsehen wird diese Merkmale noch weiter veraendern.
Buecher zur Geschichte oder ueber andere Laender werden eine marginale
Rolle in unserer Lebenspraxis behalten, aber die Faehigkeit, Bilder zu
lesen und zu verstehen, Veraenderungen zu erkennen und zu bewirken,
Bilder zu veroeffentlichen und wiederzuverwenden oder sie zu ergaenzen,
ueberhaupt die Faehigkeit, eigene Bilder herzustellen, ist fuer unsere
Leistungsfaehigkeit von entscheidender Bedeutung.  Wenn es nicht
gelingt, den Schueler zu fesseln und zu engagieren, werden alle
Bildungsbemuehungen nichtig sein.  Es ist schwer zu begreifen, dass es
keine absoluten Werte gibt; aber wenn nicht alle Generationen zu
dieser Einsicht gelangen, werden sich die Generationskonflikte
verschaerfen.  Dagegen ist das Fernsehen gewiss kein Allheilmittel;
aber es kann eine breite Grundlage fuer ein gegenseitiges Verstaendnis
dafuer schaffen, wie wir uns den immer bedrohlicheren
Herausforderungen stellen koennen.  Natuerlich ist von einem Fernsehen
die Rede, das den in der Industriegesellschaft erworbenen Status
eines Massenkommunikationsmittels abgelegt und sich zu einem
Instrument persoenlicher Interaktion weiterentwickelt hat.

Ein Verstaendnis fuer Unterschiede zu entwickeln, kann nicht nur die
Aufgabe der Erziehung sein oder auf den Fernsehkonsum beschraenkt
bleiben.  Dieses Problem gehoert zu den wichtigen Aufgaben unseres
politischen Lebens.  Alle Menschen sind vor dem Gesetz gleich, und
alle bekommen die gleichen Chancen, sich ihren Moeglichkeiten
entsprechend zu entwickeln; deshalb muss eine Gesellschaft jeglichen
Anspruch auf Homogenitaet und Uniformitaet zurueckstellen und alles dazu
tun, die Bedeutung der Unterschiede zwischen ihren unterschiedlichen
Mitgliedern herauszustellen.  Die Erwartungen, die mit dieser Art von
Erziehung einhergehen, richten sich auf Persoenlichkeitsentfaltung und
Erfuellung in den gewaehlten Taetigkeitsbereichen als Wissenschaftler,
Taenzer, Denker, Facharbeiter, Bauer, Sportler usw.  Mit anderen
Worten: das Ziel ist nicht primaer ein gutbezahlter Job, sondern eine
befriedigende Arbeit.  Die Mittel und Wege dazu wird uns weder der
Staat noch irgendeine Behoerde weisen.  Wir selbst muessen sie
entdecken, erproben und verbessern, und zwar immer im Wissen darum,
dass wir an die Stelle einer starren Institution einen nach vorn
offenen Prozess setzen, aus dem heraus wir uns als gebildete und
ausgebildete Persoenlichkeiten entwickeln.

Laeuft Erziehung in Zukunft auf eine allgemeine Handelsschule hinaus?
Fuer die, die wollen, schon.  Anderen stehen andere Moeglichkeiten
offen, solange wir Erziehung als ein offenes Unterfangen begreifen,
das sich auf die Bildungsbeduerfnisse einrichtet, die sich im Verlauf
eines langen, lernwilligen Lebens ergeben.  Die Ausbildung von
interaktiven Kompetenzen, in Visualisierungstechnologien, im Umgang
mit Internet und Datenbaenken, die Sensibilisierung der Sinne als
Denk- und Erfahrungsorgane--sie alle erfordern einen Lernkontext, den
keine Schule und keine Universitaet der Welt bieten kann.  Wenn aber
alle bisherigen Bildungsressourcen gemeinsam zur Einrichtung der oben
skizzierten interaktiven Lernzentren beitragen wuerden, dann haetten
wir es nicht mehr mit einem maroden und finanziell bankrotten
Unternehmen zu tun, sondern Wege in eine erfolgreiche Zukunft
gefunden.

Die Menschen werden heute aelter, die Altersstruktur der Gesellschaft
veraendert sich, daraus ergibt sich ein weiterer Bildungsbedarf.  Zu
den am staerksten anwachsenden Benutzergruppen im Internet gehoert die
Gruppe der aelteren Menschen, die nicht nur sehr motiviert sind,
sondern erstaunliche Faehigkeiten aufweisen, von denen die
Gesellschaft noch besser profitieren koennte.

Der Zugang zum verfuegbaren Wissen ueber interaktive Projekte im
aufgezeigten organisatorischen Rahmen ist weder trivial noch billig.
Die vernetzte Welt, alle neuen Kommunikationsmittel und auch das
keineswegs mehr utopische digitale Fernsehen sind schon heute vielen
und vielerorts zugaenglich.  Denjenigen, die bislang keinen Zugang zu
dieser Technologie gefunden haben, koennte er leicht dadurch
ermoeglicht werden, dass die hohen Ausgaben fuer die derzeitige
Bildungsbuerokratie umverteilt werden.  Statt weiterhin in Gebaeude,
Verwaltungsapparate, Normen und Regulierungen zu investieren, statt
verfallende Schulgebaeude wiederaufzubauen und all die Lehrer
wiederzuverwerten, die mangels richtiger paedagogischer
Herausforderungen geistig laengst veroedet sind, sollten wir ein neues,
ein globales Bildungssystem entwerfen.  Dieses wuerde sich nicht nur
fuer ein Land, nicht nur fuer wenige reiche Laender, sondern kraft
seiner allgemeinen Verfuegbarkeit fuer die ganze Welt segensreich
auswirken.  Die in unabhaengigen Modulen erstellten Lehrinhalte wuerden
sich aus authentischer Arbeit, aus wirklichen Problemstellungen der
Lebenspraxis ergeben, nicht aus von Lehrern erdachten und in
Lehrbuechern festgeschriebenen Schuluebungen.

Effizienz in der Lebenspraxis ist der einzige Erfolgsmassstab.
Zensuren werden insofern irrelevant, als sich praktische Taetigkeit,
in der sich die Selbstkonstituierung von Individuen vollzieht, nicht
durch Multiple-choice-Verfahren ueberpruefen laesst.  Hier ist der Mensch
in seiner Gesamtheit angesprochen, dieses Lernen fuehrt zu
persoenlicher Reifung und erhoehtem sozialen Bewusstsein.


Unerwartete Gelegenheiten

Wir haben es immer wieder zu hoeren bekommen: Wir leben im Zeitalter
des Wissens.  Damit ist ein Erfahrungszusammenhang bezeichnet, dessen
wesentliche Ressourcen kognitiver Natur sind.  Im Zeitalter der
Schriftkultur vollzog sich die Aneignung von Wissen eher langsam und
erstreckte sich ueber eine laengere Zeitdauer.  Das Wissen, dass sich
aus den praktischen Erfahrungen und Taetigkeiten der
Industriegesellschaft ergab, lief letztendlich auf eine Erleichterung
der Lebensbedingungen fuer den Menschen hinaus.  Alles, was
urspruenglich durch Muskelkraft des Menschen und seine handwerklichen
Fertigkeiten geleistet worden war, wurde zunehmend Maschinen
uebertragen und mit Hilfe von Energieressourcen durchgefuehrt, die der
Mensch in seiner Umwelt fand.  Das menschliche Denken foerderte die
Weiterentwicklung von immer mehr und immer leistungsfaehigeren
Maschinen, die sich auf alle nur denkbaren Anwendungsgebiete
erstreckten.  Energie konnte auf eine so effiziente Weise eingesetzt
werden, dass schliesslich Maschinen Arbeiten uebernahmen, fuer deren
Durchfuehrung die menschliche Arbeitskraft Dutzende oder Hunderte von
Menschen benoetigt haette.

Zur Verdeutlichung wollen wir einige Aufgaben des Maschinenzeitalters
mit denen unseres heutigen Wissenszeitalters vergleichen.  In der
industriellen Lebenspraxis ersetzte die Maschine die Muskelkraft und
die begrenzten mechanischen Fertigkeiten, die zur Verarbeitung von
Rohmaterialien, zur Herstellung von Autos, zum Waschen der Waesche
oder zum Schreiben eines Typoskripts noetig waren.  Neu entdeckte
Energiequellen hielten die Maschine am Laufen, so dass sie schliesslich
auch von der Fabrik aus die privaten Haushalte eroberte.  Die
Schriftkultur, die die wesentlichen Merkmale der industriellen
Lebenspraxis verkoerperte, hielt mit den Anforderungen und
Moeglichkeiten des Maschinenzeitalters Schritt.  In unserem Zeitalter
nun sind Computerprogramme an die Stelle der Maschine getreten; sie
ersetzen das Denken und das begrenzte Wissen, dass man zur UEberwachung
von komplexen Produktionsanlagen benoetigt, die Rohmaterialien
verarbeiten und neue Materialien herstellen.  Computerprogramme
ueberwachen die Herstellung von Automobilen; sie lenken zahlreiche
Funktionen in unseren Haushalten--Heizung, Waschen und Trocknen der
Waesche, Kochen, Hausueberwachung.  Auch die Publikationstaetigkeit im
World Wide Web ist vom Computer abhaengig.  Alle diese Leistungen
vollziehen sich in einer globalen Skala.  Viele Sprachen dienen als
Datentraeger fuer jede spezielle Teilaufgabe und gehen in das
Endprodukt ein.  Die frueheren Abhaengigkeiten von natuerlichen
Ressourcen und von einem gesellschaftlichen Modell, das fuer die
optimale Funktionsfaehigkeit der industriellen Lebenspraxis
zugeschnitten war, eruebrigen sich in dem Masse, in dem sich der Fokus
von Dauerhaftigkeit auf fluechtigere Interessengemeinschaften oder auf
das Individuum verlagert--die eigentlichen Organisationseinheiten des
Wissenszeitalters.

Kognitive Ressourcen ergeben sich aus Erfahrungen, die von denen des
Maschinenzeitalters qualitativ unterschieden sind.  Digitale
Maschinen verbrennen weder Kohle noch Gas--digitale Maschinen
verbrennen Wissen.  Die Quelle eines jeden Wissens liegt bekanntlich
im Geist eines jeden Menschen.  Die Ressourcen des
Maschinenzeitalters erschoepfen sich allmaehlich.  Alternative
Ressourcen lassen sich in den Bereichen erschliessen, die
ueblicherweise unbeachtet blieben.  Recycling und die Erfindung von
Prozessen, die aus dem Verfuegbaren noch mehr herausholen, muessen sehr
viel staerker auf menschliches Wissen zurueckgreifen als auf rohe
Verarbeitungsmethoden.  Dabei sind die Wissensquellen prinzipiell
unbegrenzt.  Wenn jedoch die kognitive Komponente unserer praktischen
Erfahrungen stagnieren oder aus irgendeinem unvorstellbaren Grunde
zusammenbrechen wuerde, dann wuerde mit ihr die gesamte auf dem
digitalen Ablauf des Wissenszeitalters basierende Pragmatik
zusammenfallen.  Man stelle sich einmal vor, dass man mit einem Auto
auf einer menschenleeren Strasse liegenbleibt, weil der Benzintank
leer ist.  Was wuerde im Vergleich dazu passieren, wenn eine komplexe
Maschine, die komplizierter als all das ist, was Science-fiction
ersinnen koennte, stillstehen wuerde, weil sie nicht mehr von
menschlichem Denken gefuettert wird?

Die Dynamik unseres Wissens, die sich irgendwo zwischen den Polen der
Informationsverarbeitung und des Wissenserwerbs und der
Wisssensverbreitung zum Ausdruck bringt, steht fuer die Dynamik
unseres gesamten Lebenssystems.  Das in neuen Technologien und
Verarbeitungsmethoden verkoerperte Wissen ist fuer die fundamentale
Trennung des Individuums von den Produktionsaufgaben und von einer
Vielzahl weiterer, nicht produktiver Taetigkeiten verantwortlich.
Kein Individuum muss ueber das gesamte Wissen verfuegen, das eine
lebenspraktische Situation erfordert.  Betriebsingenieure in
Atomkraftwerken brauchen zum Beispiel keine grossartigen Physiker oder
Mathematiker zu sein.  Nicht alle Arbeiter in einem
Raumforschungsprogramm muessen Raumfahrtspezialisten sein.  Ein
Programmierer braucht nicht unbedingt zu wissen, wie ein
Diskettenlaufwerk funktioniert.  Ein Gehirnchirurg muss nicht wissen,
wie die Instrumente hergestellt werden, die er verwendet.  Jede
einzelne Facette einer bestimmten pragmatischen Situation hat
spezifische Erfordernisse.  Die gesamte pragmatische Situation setzt
jedoch ein Wissen voraus, ueber das ein Individuum weder verfuegen kann
noch verfuegen sollte.  Das jeweils relevante begrenzte Wissen wird
heute nicht mehr einheitlich ueber schriftkulturelle Methoden
verbreitet, es ist in Instrumenten und Methoden, nicht in Menschen
eingebaut und wird auf diese Weise verbreitet.  Der ungeheure Vorteil
liegt darin, dass Programme und Verfahren vereinheitlicht werden,
nicht aber die Menschen.  Datenmanagement kann fortgeschrittenes
Wissen nicht ersetzen; aber ein Datenmanagementsystem kann mit Wissen
in Form von routinierten Erfahrungen, Ablaeufen, Handlungsschemata,
Verwaltung und Selbstevaluation ausgestattet werden.

So wie jeder einzelne am reibungslosen Ablauf der mechanischen
Maschine beteiligt war, ist jeder einzelne, ob Laie oder Spezialist,
auch am reibungslosen Funktionieren der digitalen Maschine beteiligt.
Die einzige zuverlaessige Wissensquelle liegt in den Menschen, die
sich in praktischen Erfahrungen entfaltet haben, welche das Digitale
miteinbezog.  Nicht jeder wird natuerlich ein Denker, und nicht jeder
produziert Wissen.  Im Wissenszeitalter jenseits der Schriftkultur
sind vor allem zwei Wissensquellen relevant.  Die eine Quelle speist
die hochspezialisierte Arbeit von Spezialisten und Forschern in hohen
Abstraktionsbereichen, die weit ueber dem liegen, was die
Schriftkultur artikulieren konnte.  Die andere Quelle ist in den auf
den gesunden Menschenverstand gruendenden Interaktionen angelegt, in
der alltaeglichen Erfahrung des Menschen.

Dass das Spezialistenwissen wohl auch weiterhin in die Lebenspraxis
unseres Zeitalters eingebunden bleiben wird, ist ohne Zweifel.  Die
spezifischen Motivationen, die zu neuem Wissen fuehren, muessen erkannt
und angeregt werden.  Auch muessen wir solche Umstaende in Betracht
ziehen, die sich negativ auf die neues Wissen hervorbringenden
Lebensumstaende auswirken koennten.

UEber die zweite Wissensquelle wissen wir sehr viel weniger, denn in
vorausgegangenen Lebenszusammenhaengen war sie weniger wichtig und
daher weitgehend ignoriert worden.  Wir wissen vor allem nicht, wie
wir das unbegrenzte Reservoir jener Wissensressourcen anzapfen koennen,
die sich im Alltag und in der routinierten Arbeit des groessten Teils
der Weltbevoelkerung manifestieren.  Jedes einzelne Individuum kann
mit eigenen kognitiven Ressourcen zu der allgemeinen Dynamik der Welt
beitragen.  Aber diese Beitraege sind zufaellig, schwierig zu
identifizieren und lohnen nicht immer den Aufwand, der zu ihrer
Foerderung notwendig ist.  Viele Entscheidungen, die wir in unserem
Leben treffen, beruhen auf ausserordentlich wirkkraeftigen Prozeduren,
derer wir uns als Individuen selten oder nie bewusst werden.  In
manchen scheinbar banalen Verrichtungen steckt der Keim zu einem
Genie.  Das Abtauchen in die Tiefe der kollektiven persona scheint
aber lohnenswert.

Vor einigen Jahren sprach ich mit einem prominenten
Erziehungswissenschaftler, der in seinem Institut bereits mit
interaktiven Simulationsprogrammen fuer Jugendliche arbeitete.  Wir
unterhielten uns ueber das damals sehr beliebte Computerspiel Game of
Life (von John Horton Conway) und die Moeglichkeit, es fuer neue
Unterrichtsformen zu nutzen.  Das Game of Life basiert auf der
Theorie von Zellularautomaten und simuliert bestimmte
Gesetzmaessigkeiten von Geburt und Tod.  Die Spielregeln sind relativ
einfach, aber innerhalb derselben laufen sehr komplexe Formen des
kuenstlichen Lebens ab: Eine Zelle, die sich voll entwickelt,
verkoerpert entstehendes Leben, die gegenteilige Richtung Tod.  Ziel
des Spiels ist es, komplexe Lebensformen zur Ausbildung zu bringen.

Unsere UEberlegung ging dahin, dieses Spiel einer grossen Spielerschaft
im Netzwerk weltweit zugaenglich zu machen, so dass Hunderttausende von
Mitspielern die Spuren ihrer kognitiven Entscheidung zuruecklassen
wuerden.  Aus diesen allen wuerde sich die "Intelligenz" des gesamten
Kollektivs herauskristallisieren, das an diesem Spiel beteiligt ist.
Die so erreichte kognitive Gesamtsumme hat Gestalt-Charakter--sie ist
sehr viel mehr als die Summe aller ihrer Teile, hat also eine
qualitativ andere Natur, die vielleicht sogar mit der von
Spezialisten oder Genies vergleichbar ist.  Aber wenn wir uns die
enorme Anzahl von Anwendungen vor Augen halten, die in dieses Projekt
eingegangen waeren und die von voellig nutzlos bis zu hoch produktiv
reichen, dann laesst sich leicht ermessen, dass diese Wissens- und
Intelligenzquelle viel interessanter ist als die von Spezialisten und
professionellen Denkern in einem bestimmten Bereich.  In dem, was wir
tun und wie wir uns entscheiden, liegt mehr als nur Rationalitaet und
Denkkraft, von schriftkultureller Rationalitaet gar nicht zu reden.

Bei einer solchen kollektiven persona braeuchte es sich gar nicht um
die gesamte Weltbevoelkerung zu handeln (abzueglich der Wissensprofis).
Man koennte mit ad hoc-Gruppen beginnen, also Gruppen, die ein
bestimmtes Interesse teilen oder nach einer bestimmten Information in
einem alltaeglichen Zusammenhang suchen.  Wir wuerden auf diese Weise
einen wichtigen Einblick in die kognitiven Ressourcen gewinnen, die
im Alltag aktiv sind, und koennten davon ausgehend wichtige Prozeduren
entwickeln, die die individuelle Leistungsfaehigkeit im Alltag enorm
erhoehen wuerden--und das hiesse keineswegs, dass individuelles Verhalten
in groteske Formen repetitiver Verhaltensmuster gezwaengt wuerde.

Wenn wir wirklich in einem Wissenszeitalter leben, koennen wir uns
nicht auf das Wissen weniger beschraenken, so aussergewoehnlich diese
auch sein moegen.  Jenseits der Schriftkultur ist das
schriftkulturelle Modell individueller Leistung kein Garant mehr fuer
die Leistungsfaehigkeit der gesamten Gesellschaft.

Mit der zunehmenden Komplexitaet unseres Lebens koennen wir
Zusammenbrueche vermutlich nur auf Kosten weiterer kognitiver
Ressourcen verhindern.  Es hat Jahrtausende gedauert, bis sich aus
den primitiven Formen der Notation die Schrift und schliesslich die
Schriftkultur herausgebildet haben.  Im Wissenszeitalter koennen wir
uns einen derartig langwierigen Zyklus zur Integration der kognitiven
Ressourcen nicht leisten.  Es ist bedrueckend zu sehen, wie wenig
Gebrauch wir von der weitgehend verschwendeten Geistestaetigkeit vor
dem Fernsehgeraet oder auch beim Surfen im World Wide Web machen.
Natuerlich sind Unterhaltung und Entspannung notwendig, dennoch ist
die beim Zuschauen eines Fussballspiels verwendete Energie ebenso
verschwendet wie beim Surfen im Web, in dem die Suche nach
pornographischem Material diejenige nach Mathematik oder Literatur
bei weitem uebersteigt.  Wenn wir aus den Computerspielen kognitive
Informationen ableiten koennten, haetten wir nicht nur der
Spielwarenindustrie geholfen, die die Natur des menschlichen Spiels
nachhaltig veraendert hat, sondern auch Einsicht gewonnen in die
kognitiven und emotionalen Aspekte dieser elementaren Formen
menschlicher Identitaetsfindung.  Neben den allgemeinen Ansichten ueber
die Natur des homo ludens gibt es auch quantifizierbare Aspekte
bezueglich Wettkampf, Vergnuegen und Befriedigung im Spiel.  Das
Internet ermoeglicht unsere Reise durch Unmengen von Daten,
Informationen und Wissensquellen.  Sollen wir den Zugang zu diesen
kognitiven Landkarten wirklich Marketing-Experten ueberlassen, oder
waeren sie nicht doch besser verwendet, wenn wir mit ihrer Hilfe
besser verstehen koennten, was uns im einzelnen bewegt, wenn wir nach
einem Wort, einem Bild oder einer Erfahrung suchen.  Daten ueber unser
Kaufverhalten sagen nicht unbedingt etwas ueber unsere Persoenlichkeit
aus.  Fuer viele Menschen ist der Kauf von Konsumguetern lediglich
Vollzug einer Vermittlung, die von den Betreibern der gekauften
Dienstleistungen oder Gegenstaende getragen wird.  Es gibt aber
authentische Erfahrungen und Lebensformen, in denen der Mensch durch
nichts ersetzt werden kann.  Hierzu gehoert neben dem Scherzen oder
neben gesellschaftlicher Interaktion vor allem der Bereich des Spiels.
In diesen authentischen Augenblicken unserer Selbstkonstituierung
werden ausserordentlich wertvolle kognitive Ressourcen aktiviert.

Die globale Vernetzung ist sehr viel transparenter als irgendein
Medium der Schriftkultur es je war.  Die Printmedien sind prinzipiell
durch ein Verhaeltnis 1:1 gekennzeichnet; das Fernsehen erweitert
dieses Verhaeltnis allenfalls auf eine Kleingruppe.  An einer
Web-Seite hingegen koennen Tausende von Teilnehmern angeschlossen sein.
Doch auch hier ist die Transparenz keineswegs uneingeschraenkt.  Vom
Server koennen sie zwar erfahren, dass eine kleine oder grosse Anzahl
von Teilnehmern gegenwaertig ist, nicht aber deren Identitaet, das Ziel
ihrer Suche oder die kognitiven Komponenten, die in der jeweiligen
individuellen Erfahrung aktiviert sind.  Diese Anonymitaet gilt
weitgehend unserem Schutz vor uns selbst.  Wir muessten also Methoden
entwickeln, mit Hilfe derer wir uns im jeweils von uns gewuenschten
Mass identifizieren und offenbaren und unsere Bereitschaft zur
Interaktion bekunden koennen.  Mit diesen Methoden koennten wir
kognitive Ressourcen anzapfen, die uns bislang unzugaenglich geblieben
sind, aber einen enormen Wert darstellen.

Digitale Maschinen, die als Energie unser Wissen und unsere
Erkenntnis verbrennen, haben eine Effizienz in einer Groessenordnung
erreicht, die die Effizienz von Maschinen, die Kohle oder OEl
verbrennen, weit uebersteigt.  Die neuen Moeglichkeiten setzen uns
allerdings auch unter einen neuen, ungewohnten Druck, der durch die
beschleunigte Akkumulation von Daten, durch die
Informationsverarbeitung und die Wissensverwertung erzeugt wird.  Um
das Verhaeltnis zwischen der digitalen Maschine und unserer eigenen
Leistung zu verstehen, muessten wir uns eine Dampfmaschine vorstellen,
die eine Lokomotive bergauf treibt.  Unser neues Stadium jenseits der
Schriftkultur ist ein solcher Steilhang mit mancherlei
Hindernissen--unsere begrenzten koerperlichen Faehigkeiten, unsere
begrenzten natuerlichen Ressourcen, oekologische UEberlegungen, unsere
Faehigkeit zur Behandlung komplexer gesellschaftlicher Probleme.  Hier
einfach nur die Bremse zu ziehen, wuerde lediglich die Arbeit der
Maschine erschweren; es sei denn, wir hielten es fuer erstrebenswert,
den Steilhang Hals ueber Kopf hinunter zu purzeln.  Jeder kluge
Ingenieur weiss, dass die einzig vernuenftige Loesung darin liegt, das
Feuer anzuheizen.  Das koennte fast wie ein Fluch klingen, der ueber
uns lastet.  Aber die Spannung, die in der Moeglichkeit neuer
Entdeckungen liegt, auch in der Erforschung unserer eigenen
kognitiven Ressourcen, wiegt das allemal wieder auf.

Genug der Beispiele.  Die digitale Maschine wird nicht von
irgendwelchen abstrakten Rechenleistungen noch schnellerer Chips
angetrieben, sondern von menschlichem Wissen und menschlicher
Erkenntnis, die sich in Erfahrungen ausdruecken, welche sich weiter
diversifizieren.  Noch ist der Fall nicht eingetreten, dass wir zu
viel Energie und zu viel Computerkapazitaeten haetten und nicht wuessten,
wohin damit.  Ganz im Gegenteil: Unsere Lebenspraxis ist der
verfuegbaren Technologie immer einen Schritt voraus, wir stellen uns
immer neue Fragen und begegnen uns neuen Herausforderungen, fuer die
die Chips von gestern nicht ausreichen und das verfuegbare
elektronische Gedaechtnis genauso unzureichend ist, wie die Mittel und
Methoden der Schriftkultur.

Seit einiger Zeit schon versucht man, die bioelektrischen Signale zu
messen, die sich aus der Taetigkeit unseres Gehirns ergeben.  Wir
haben von diesen Messungen gelernt, dass sich der Geist in
Antizipierung praktischer Erfahrungen, in denen wir unsere Identitaet
finden, konstituiert.  Das klingt trotz der vorliegenden
wissenschaftlichen Beweise etwas weit hergeholt.  Denken ist ein
Prozess, und bioelektrische Signale bekunden den Ablauf solcher
Prozesse in unserem Gehirn.  Sensoren auf unserer Haut koennen solche
Signale lesen; sie koennen lesen, wie sich die Denkprozesse, die auf
unseren kognitiven Ressourcen basieren, entfalten.  Wenn wir die
digitalen Maschinen mit dieser Energie fuettern, koennen wir mancherlei
Nutzen daraus ziehen: durch gedankliche Impulse kontrollierte
prothetische Vorrichtungen fuer Behinderte, aber auch Impulse fuer den
Pinsel eines Malers, fuer Filmregie und Filmschnitt am Computer, die
uns in kinomatographische Projekte und in die Erstellung oder
Veraenderung von Filmskripten einbinden.  Alle unsere bekannten
Sportspiele und viele unbekannte neue Spiele oeffnen sich als eine
neue virtuelle Realitaet, und unsere Gedanken ermoeglichen im Umgang
mit ihnen neue Erfahrungen.  Gerade auch fuer Behinderte bietet sich
hier ein neuer Horizont von bisher unbekannter Qualitaet.  Viele
Wissenschaftler, unter ihnen Einstein, waren davon ueberzeugt, dass wir
in dem, was wir tun, nur ungefaehr 10% unserer kognitiven Faehigkeiten
verwenden.  In dem Masse, in dem die digitale Maschine mit dieser
neuen Energie gefuettert wird, aendert sich diese Zahl, und mit ihr
vermutlich unsere koerperliche Verfassung, die schon jetzt durch
Degenerationserscheinungen gekennzeichnet ist.

Wenn wir aber den Grad unserer gegenwaertigen Moeglichkeiten mit nur
10% unserer kognitiven Ressourcen erreichen konnten, dann laesst sich
leicht ermessen, was wir mit weiteren 10% erreichen koennten.  Die
neue Phase der Menschheitsentwicklung jenseits der Schriftkultur, mit
allen Gefahren und allen Unwaegbarkeiten, hat eben erst begonnen.  Dass
sie von kuerzerer Dauer sein wird als die ihr vorausgegangene, ist ein
anderes Thema.




Nachwort


Umbruch verlangt Umdenken

Angenommen, wir befinden uns tatsaechlich jenseits der Schriftkultur,
was heisst das fuer Deutschland?  Das heisst--und zwar nicht nur fuer
Deutschland--, dass wir alle umdenken muessen.  Das klingt sehr einfach,
ist aber tatsaechlich das schwierigste Ziel, das man sich selbst
setzen oder von anderen erwarten kann.  Aber ohne Umdenken koennen wir
den Umbruch, der sich in der ganzen Welt vollzieht und unter dem
Deutschland mehr zu leiden scheint als andere Laender, weder verstehen
noch in den Griff bekommen.

Outsourcing ist ein probates Mittel, wenn es um Produktion oder
Dienstleistungen geht, nicht aber, wenn wir ueber unsere Lage
nachdenken muessen.  Auf allen Ebenen der Gesellschaft sind die
Menschen darauf versessen, viel Geld fuer ein gutes oeffentliches Image
zu bezahlen.  Wie andere Laender auch, ist Deutschland geradezu
zwanghaft davon besessen, ein positives oeffentliches Bild abzugeben.
Oft ist das Erscheinungsbild wichtiger als die Substanz.  Weil etwas
gut aussieht, sind wir versucht, das Nachdenken zu verdraengen.  So
akzeptieren wir bereitwillig die ererbten veralteten Strukturen.
Gibt es fuer die Projektion eines guten Image eine bessere Methode,
als die Maschine der schriftkulturellen Praxis gruendlich zu ueberholen
und zur Hoechstleistung zu bringen?  Schliesslich ist das Geld, das
dafuer ausgegeben wird, nicht das Geld derer, die es ausgeben.
Berater und Redenschreiber arbeiten keineswegs im Verborgenen und
streichen hohe Profite ein, selbst in Notzeiten.  Diese
Imagefabrikanten haben letztendlich nichts anderes zu tun, als mit
Variationen der ausgedienten Schriftkultur, deren Ende dieses Buch
ausgiebig diskutiert hat, ihr eigenes Dasein zu rechtfertigen.
Besser waere es, sie wuerden die Entwicklungsschuebe erkennen, die ihre
Funktion und die Funktion derer, die sie angestellt haben,
ueberfluessig, wenn nicht gar kontraproduktiv machen.  Der letzte
Wahlkampf in Deutschland ist ein gutes Beispiel fuer die hier
beschriebene Situation.  Aber waehrend die Deutschen noch auf die
Errungenschaften ihrer Vergangenheit blicken--auf ihre
Sozialprogramme, ihre Kunst, ihre Forschung, ihre Wissenschaft und
ihre Gelehrsamkeit--, hat die Zukunft laengst begonnen.  Diese Zukunft
fordert Loesungen, die in den Formeln der Vergangenheit nicht zu
finden sind.

Wen immer der geneigte Leser bei der letzten Bundestagswahl gewaehlt
hat, die Chancen, dass er sehr schnell enttaeuscht sein wird, sind
nicht gering.  Es ist eine traurige Wahrheit, dass es keine Rolle
spielte, wem man seine Stimme gab, weil eine wirkliche Alternative
nicht zur Wahl stand.  Diese Aussage betrifft Wahlen schlechthin.
Ich wage eine solche unbequeme, aber keineswegs seltene Auffassung,
weil die Politik, so wie sie ueberall auf der Welt und besonders in
Deutschland betrieben wird, Ausdruck von Erwartungen und Werten ist,
die aus der Schriftkultur hervorgegangen sind.  Sie ist nicht auf die
neue Lebensund Arbeitspraxis der Menschen zugeschnitten.  Diese
Politik ist schon seit jeher zutiefst opportunistisch.  In Zeiten des
Wachstums und des Wohlstands konnte sie ihren Einfluss erweitern und
praktisch alle Bereiche des menschlichen Lebens ergreifen.  In den
Jahren des Wirtschaftswunders konnte Deutschland es sich leisten, den
Einfluss der Politik so weit auszudehnen, dass sie jeden Aspekt des
Lebens erfasste und regelte: Handelsgesetze (bis hin zu den
OEffnungszeiten der Geschaefte), oeffentliche Einrichtungen, Parks,
Kinderspielplaetze, Ruhestand, Autofahren, Heiraten und alles andere
nur Denkbare.  Auch die Vereinigten Staaten greifen regulierend in
das Sexualleben, in die Kinderrechte, in den Umgang mit der Umwelt,
die Lehrergewerkschaften, das Internet, den elektronischen Handel und
in die Privatsphaere ein.  Wirtschaftlicher Erfolg scheint der Politik
die Wege zu ebnen, um auf alle Lebensbereiche zugreifen zu koennen.
In Krisenzeiten allerdings zieht sich die Politik der Schriftkultur
zurueck.  Auf alle Schwierigkeiten--hohe Arbeitslosigkeit im heutigen
Deutschland, zunehmende Fremdenfeindlichkeit, mangelnde Motivation
der Staatsbuerger, um nur drei zu nennen--, die sie durch den
politischen und sozialen Widerstand gegenueber den Kraeften des
Umbruchs selbst erzeugt hat, reagiert die Politik mit dem gleichen
Loesungsmodell: Wir haben ein Problem.  Schuld hat (natuerlich) ein
anderer, die Opposition, die Fremden, die Globalitaet unseres Lebens.
Also soll auch ein anderer die Loesung suchen oder durch sein
Verschwinden das Problem eliminieren.

Die Industriegesellschaft konnte sich nach diesem Modell einrichten,
denn es entsprach der Schriftkultur und ihren Merkmalen.  Wenn ein
Geraet nicht funktioniert, laesst man es von einem Fachmann reparieren.
Und Familie, Bildung, Gesundheitssystem erfuellen innerhalb der
Schriftkultur die gleichen Funktionen wie Maschinen und werden
entsprechend behandelt.  Die grundlegende Schwaeche dieses Modells ist
das reaktive Prinzip: Wenn etwas kaputt geht, muss es repariert werden.
Jetzt reparieren wir gerade die Bildung, das Gesundheitssystem, das
Familienleben--freilich per Dekret, von oben herab!  Auch die
"Fortschrittsmaschine" lief im Industriezeitalter reibungslos,
solange die grundlegenden politischen Voraussetzungen, die sich in
der Form der Nationalstaaten und des internationalen Handels
ausdrueckten, der Skala der Bevoelkerung entsprachen.  Heute aber geht
dieses reaktive Modell an den Problemen vorbei.  An der politisch
nicht gerade weitsichtig vollzogenen Vereinigung der beiden Teile
Deutschlands laesst sich dies gut demonstrieren.  Fest steht, dass
Westdeutschland zusammen mit dem Rest der Welt auf den Zusammenbruch
des kommunistischen Systems nicht vorbereitet war und die Gruende
dafuer bis heute nicht verstanden hat.  Als Antwort auf diese
Entwicklung wurden zwei Einheiten, die einerseits einiges gemeinsam,
andererseits sich aber stark auseinanderentwickelt hatten,
zusammengefuegt, und zwar nach dem ueberholten Modell des
Nationalstaats, nicht mit Blick auf die Beduerfnisse der weltweit
operierenden neuen Dynamik, deren wesentlicher Teil Differenz und
Differenzierung ist.  Die Entscheidung der deutschen Politiker, die
aus rein ideologischen Gruenden von den Alliierten unterstuetzt wurden,
fuehren zurueck in das Industriezeitalter und zu den Merkmalen der
Schriftkultur.  Symptomatisch ist zuallererst, dass das
Regierungszentrum mit enormem Aufwand nach Berlin zurueckverlegt wurde:
ein Monument deutscher Einheit aus einer Zeit, die hundert Jahre
zurueckliegt.  Andere Einrichtungen folgten diesem Beispiel.  Niemand
begreift oder will begreifen, dass in unserer heutigen Zeit
Standpunktfragen irrelevant sind.  Statt die Vorteile eines
effektiven verteilten Modells zu nutzen, das eine Infrastruktur
foerdern koennte, die vielleicht nicht der Regierung und der Politik,
aber dafuer um so mehr der Wirtschaft von Nutzen gewesen waere,
verankerte sich Deutschland in den voellig ineffizienten
zentralistischen und hierarchischen Strukturen der Vergangenheit.
Trotz aller aeusseren Anzeichen der Modernisierung wurde der Osten
dieses Landes in die Weimarer Zeit zurueckversetzt: Die
vergangenheitsorientierten Politiker waren mehr daran interessiert,
ihre Machtpositionen zu sichern als das enorme kreative Potential des
neuen Marktes freizusetzen, der durch die schnelle Einfuehrung der
D-Mark so billig akquiriert worden war.  Das Geld floss in Beton und
Ziegelsteine, nicht in die kognitiven Ressourcen und nicht in die
Interaktionsnetzwerke.  Buerger aus beiden Teilen Deutschlands sind
mit der jetzigen Situation unzufrieden.

Jenseits der Schriftkultur beginnt das Reich der Proaktivitaet.
Proaktiv denken heisst zunaechst einmal zu verstehen, dass alle
gegenwaertig wirksamen Prozesse--ob sie nun Individuen,
Wirtschaftsunternehmen, die Bildung, Handel, Kunst, Ethik oder
Einwanderung betreffen--notwendigerweise kuerzer sind als die
Wirkprozesse der Vergangenheit.  Parallel dazu sind die
Erneuerungszyklen--fuer ein stark exportorientiertes Land
lebenswichtig--kuerzer.  Vor allem aber heisst es, dass Zentralismus und
Hierarchie, auf die offenbar jeder in diesem Lande setzt, die
Effektivitaet des Staates und damit die Effektivitaet aller wichtigen
Taetigkeiten--von risikofreudigen Individuen, Unternehmen und selbst
Regierungsstellen--einschraenken.  Verschlankte Entscheidungsablaeufe
(lean management) und Aufgabenverteilung werden zu entscheidenden
Wettbewerbsfaktoren--und nicht nur deshalb, weil die USA und England
hier schon weiter sind als Deutschland.  Das neue Denken muss sich aus
der Einsicht ergeben, dass der Umbruch notwendig ist und dass im Zuge
dieses Umbruchs eine nationalistische Mentalitaet abgelegt werden muss.
Weil dies eine grosse historische Chance ist, koennte Deutschland wie
kein anderes Land ein Beispiel setzen.  Doch wenn es diese
Gelegenheit verstreichen laesst, wird es vermutlich einen sehr hohen
Preis dafuer bezahlen muessen.

Nur wenn sich Deutschland auf allen Ebenen--auf lokaler, staatlicher
und nationaler Ebene--von den Normen und Zwaengen seines
traditionellen Systems, aus Verordnungen und Regulierungen befreit,
kann aus den guten Vorsaetzen mehr werden als nur voruebergehender
Erfolg.  Ein proaktives politisches Klima und ein in Verordnungen und
Regulierungen stagnierender Geist schliessen sich gegenseitig aus.  Im
uebrigen hat sich gezeigt, dass insbesondere im Bereich der
Kommunalpolitik, hier wieder besonders bei der Foerderung von
Existenzgruendungen, gute Vorsaetze zu nachweisbaren Erfolgen gefuehrt
haben.  Manch ein Gemeinderat musste sich dabei um alte Gesetze
herummogeln, um Existenzgruendungen im Bereich der Telekommunikation
oder der Dienstleistungsangebote im Internet foerdern zu koennen.
Hierbei waren die Anreize, die man fuer Existenzgruendungen geboten
hatte, besonders attraktiv.  Sie reichen indes keineswegs aus.  Die
meisten Existenzneugruendungen beruhen noch immer auf Eigeninitiative
ohne jegliche oeffentliche Hilfe.  Auch hier gilt die alte Erfahrung:
Je lauter und oefter eine Erfolgsgeschichte wiederholt wird, desto
eklatanter sind die insgesamt mageren Ergebnisse, die damit
beschoenigt werden sollen.  Jeder, der sich mit den neuen
buerokratischen Mechanismen, die solche Initiativen foerdern sollen,
etwas auskennt, weiss, wie wenig von der gesamten Investitionssumme
tatsaechlich fuer Innovationen aufgewendet wurde.  Es fehlt nicht an
Geld, sondern an Transparenz.  Die bei weitem meisten Gelder fliessen
noch immer in den Wasserkopf der Schriftkultur: in die semantischen
Spielchen demagogischer Argumentation und Rechtfertigung.  Die
riesigen Plakate, mit denen der Weg in die Selbstaendigkeit
angepriesen wird, kosten weitaus mehr als das, was die jungen
Menschen als Starthilfe benoetigen wuerden.

Deutschlands Modernisierungsversuche werden auch dadurch behindert,
dass es fuer jeden Schritt, den es in Sachen Deregulierung nach vorne
macht, hinsichtlich der Buerokratisierung der europaeischen
Verhaeltnisse zwei Schritte zurueckgeht.  Die schwerfaellige Buerokratie
der europaeischen Behoerden beduerfte dringend einer Neustrukturierung,
die der neuen Pragmatik entspricht.  Diese aber von denen zu erwarten,
die zu dieser Buerokratie gehoeren und von ihr profitieren, waere naiv.
Sie denken nur in Vor-Schriften, die ihnen Sicherheit, Ordnung und
Fortschritt zu versprechen scheinen, selbst wenn der Preis dafuer eine
hohe Arbeitslosigkeit ist.  Man kann nur hoffen, dass die Europaeer
selbst, wenn sie sich in ihrem neuen Haus erst einmal eingerichtet
haben, die Initiative ergreifen und Alternativen entwickeln werden.
Diese muessten dann sehr viel staerker auf Dezentralisierung, auf lokale
Autonomie, also auf kleine, sich selbst organisierende Kernzentren
setzen, ausgerichtet am foederalistischen Vorbild der USA oder, wenn
dieses Beispiel in Europa nicht willkommen sein sollte, an der
Schweiz.  Und dann wird man sehen, woher die richtungsweisenden Ideen
kommen: von den Unternehmern, die auf der lokalen Ebene um ihr
wirtschaftliches UEberleben kaempfen, sich aber der globalen Dimension
ihrer Taetigkeit vollkommen bewusst sind; von den Intellektuellen in
ihren behaglichen akademischen Schutzhuellen; oder von den Politikern.
Eine besondere Rolle werden die Gewerkschaften spielen, die in der
Vergangenheit ein wesentlicher Veraenderungsfaktor gewesen sind, heute
aber aus einer kurzsichtigen Politik heraus eher einen konservativen
Kurs betreiben.  Kein status quo kann den Interessen derer nuetzen,
die sich in den Gewerkschaften repraesentiert sehen, sondern nur
wirksame Veraenderungen, die die einzelnen staerken.  Heute verhindern
die Gewerkschaften die Einfuehrung neuer Technologien oder erschweren
sie zumindest.  Schon morgen werden sie vielleicht erkennen, dass der
Preis fuer diese kurzsichtige Politik sehr hoch ist: dass sie naemlich
niemand mehr haben will.

Losloesung von der Schriftkultur heisst vor allem, dass wir uns auf ein
proaktives Denken, auf Deregulierung, Dezentralismus und die
Abschaffung von Entscheidungshierarchien einlassen.  Proaktives
Denken beinhaltet die Bereitschaft zum Experiment, zum Verlassen
alter, eingetretener Pfade und zum Beschreiten neuer Wege.  Obwohl in
Deutschland grosse Summen fuer die Forschung ausgegeben werden, die vor
allem in die hervorragenden Max-Planck-Institute und die von der DFG
finanzierten Forschungsprojekte fliessen, hat es lange Zeit keine
ausreichenden Rahmenbedingungen fuer neue Technologien wie Biogenetik,
kuenstliche Intelligenz (KI), kuenstliches Leben (ALife) und modernes
wissenschaftliches Rechnen (advanced scientific computation) gegeben.
Die Hochleistungsforschung im Bereich der traditionellen
Wissenschaften und Technologiebereiche war und ist ausgezeichnet.
Viele Ergebnisse im Bereich der Lasertechnologie, der
Hochgeschwindigkeitstelekommunikation, alternativer Energiequellen
(um nur einige wenige zu nennen) sind aber im Ausland, von deutschen
oder auslaendischen Unternehmen, praktisch umgesetzt worden, weil in
Deutschland die Voraussetzungen hierfuer fehlten!  Das ist das direkte
Ergebnis einer Fixierung auf Tradition, Kontinuitaet, Vergangenheit
und der mangelnden Bereitschaft, sich auf radikal neue pragmatische
Rahmenbedingungen einzulassen.  Kultur als Stagnationsfaktor ist
jedoch eine falsch verstandene Kultur.

Waehrend also Deutschland seine Vergangenheit erfolgreich exportiert,
werden alle zukunftsorientierten Technologien importiert.  Ich rede
hier nicht von billigem Benzin oder Heizoel.  Hinsichtlich einiger
wissenschaftlicher Entwicklungen hat sich die bundesdeutsche
Regierung geradezu als Zensurinstanz erwiesen.  Offenbar unter dem
Eindruck einer Vergangenheit, die niemand vergessen will und
vergessen sollte, wurde es vermieden, das Wort Genetik direkt zu
verwenden.  Ironischerweise erinnert mich das daran, dass waehrend
meiner Studienzeit in einem kommunistischen Land das Wort Genetik
(zusammen mit dem Wort Computer) verboten war.  Die Folge einer
solchen Einstellung aber ist, dass die Deutschen, die sich des
unstrittigen Gefahrenpotentials der Genetik bewusst sind, nunmehr im
Ausland darin investieren.  Deutsche Firmen unterstuetzen
amerikanische Universitaeten mit Forschungsgeldern, weil ihre eigenen
Universitaeten ihre wissenschaftlichen Moeglichkeiten nicht wahrnehmen.
Jetzt sucht man in Deutschland verzweifelt den Anschluss in einem
zukunftstraechtigen Wissenschaftsbereich, der in der Kultur jenseits
der Schriftkultur von zentraler Bedeutung ist.  Mittlerweile sind
neue Gesetze verabschiedet worden, die den Anschluss an die
wissenschaftliche Entwicklung erleichtern sollen.  Das Problem liegt
aber nicht so sehr im Bereich der Technologie, in dem Deutschland
immer noch fuehrend ist, es ist ein Mentalitaetsproblem.  Neue Gesetze
aendern keine Mentalitaet und stellen nie die ausreichende Antwort auf
das dar, was zu unternehmen ist.

Silicon Valley haette kein amerikanisches Phaenomen bleiben muessen.
Deutschland haette genuegend Gelegenheiten fuer eigene wissenschaftliche
Erfolgsgeschichten gehabt, waere es nicht allzu sehr auf die
Strukturen fixiert geblieben, innerhalb derer sich vergangener (und
kurzlebiger) Ruhm und vergangenes Versagen herausgebildet hatten.
Man mag sich gar nicht vorstellen, mit welcher Leichtfertigkeit und
Geschwindigkeit unzaehlige Milliarden zur Subvention voellig veralteter
Industriezweige (unter anderem fuer die Steinkohleindustrie)
ausgegeben worden sind.  Waere dieses Geld in neue Technologien und
neue Medien investiert worden, haette Deutschland mehr als eine
Erfolgsgeschichte und weniger Arbeitslose zu vermelden gehabt.  In
der politischen Gleichung einer subventionsgestuetzten Wirtschaft sind
in Deutschland die heutigen Steuerzahler und die zukuenftigen
Generationen die echten Verlierer.  So vergeudet Deutschland nicht
nur enorme Summen, sondern seine wertvollste Ressource--eine hoch
gebildete Bevoelkerung.  Einige der fuehrenden Koepfe haben das Land
bereits verlassen und im Ausland Erfolg gehabt.  Kai Krause von
MetaCreations; John Kluge, der deutsche Emigrant, der in den
achtziger Jahren ein Mobilfunknetzwerk an Southwestern Bell und eine
Ferngespraechfirma an WorldComm verkauft hat.  Solche Erfolge koennten
der Deutschen Telekom die Farben des Neides oder der Scham ins
Gesicht treiben.  Auch mit anderen Erfolgen, die allesamt in
Deutschland unvorstellbar waeren--z.  Zt.  Metromedia Energy als
Strommakler--, macht er von sich Reden.  Und es gibt zahlreiche
andere Erfolgsgeschichten von Innovatoren, die es in ihrer geliebten
Heimat zu nichts bringen konnten wegen der buerokratischen Hindernisse,
die man jungem Unternehmergeist in den Weg legt.  Solche Beispiele
sind weder neu noch aussergewoehnlich.  Dieser Zustand in Deutschland
ist abnormal; er ist das schmerzliche Ergebnis einer politischen,
gesellschaftlichen und wirtschaftlichen Situation, die man haette
vermeiden koennen.  Immer mehr breiten sich in Deutschland
Unzufriedenheit und ein Fatalismus aus, den es in diesem Ausmass seit
dem Ende des Zweiten Weltkriegs in Deutschland nicht mehr gegeben hat.

Falsch waere es indes, das Silicon Valley oder die erwaehnten
Erfolgsgeschichten einfach nachschreiben zu wollen, wie es einige
Politiker im Bereich der Neuen Medien und der Telekommunikation
offenbar versuchen.  Eine Neuorientierung muesste in grundsaetzlichen
politischen und wirtschaftspolitischen Aktivitaeten liegen.  Um mich
nicht in Allgemeinplaetzen zu verlieren, will ich versuchen, ein
Szenario zu skizzieren, in dem solche Alternativen entwickelt werden
koennten.

Dank ihrer Tradition und ihrer besonderen wissenschaftlichen
Kompetenz sind die Deutschen hervorragend geeignet, bei der
technologischen Entwicklung der allgegenwaertigen Computation eine
Fuehrungsrolle zu uebernehmen.  Das Digitale, ein wesentlicher
Bestandteil der neuen Grundstruktur menschlicher Taetigkeit, hat seine
ersten Gehversuche gerade hinter sich.  Auf einer spektakulaeren
Konferenz unter dem Titel "Die naechsten 50 Jahre der Computation"
(1997), die der Entwicklung der Datenverarbeitung in den kommenden
fuenfzig Jahren gewidmet war, diente als Hintergrund fuer die
Praesentation neuester Computermodelle das Bild einer Hoehle aus der
Steinzeit.  Im Vergleich zu dem, was die Industriegesellschaft
produziert hat, vor allem aber hinsichtlich der sich abzeichnenden
neuen Moeglichkeiten, ist die heutige Computertechnologie relativ
primitiv.  Das in Presse und Computerkreisen viel diskutierte Problem
der Jahrtausendwende (einige Computer sind auf die Umstellung nicht
richtig programmiert) ist z. B. das Ergebnis wissenschaftlicher
Kurzsichtigkeit und technologischer Grenzen, die die Welt Milliarden
von Dollar kosten wird.  Kein anderer Industriezweig hat die
Gesellschaft auf eine aehnlich gefaehrliche Weise herausgefordert.
Aber nicht die Krise, sondern die Chancen interessieren uns hier.
Gewiss, wenn Autos, Zuege und Flugzeuge genauso unzuverlaessig waeren,
waere die halbe Menschheit bei Verkehrsunfaellen getoetet oder saemtliche
Fahrzeuge waeren stillgelegt worden.  Die Computer muessen sich also
weiterentwickeln, sie werden ausreifen und billiger werden.  Ihre
Leistungsfaehigkeit wird sich steigern.  Zuverlaessigkeit wird dabei im
Mittelpunkt stehen, denn die Experten sind sich der Tatsache bewusst,
dass hier grosse Risiken liegen und dass andererseits das Digitale in
der neuen Infrastruktur menschlichen Lebens und menschlicher Arbeit
von zentraler Bedeutung sein wird.  Wir brauchen also neue Konzepte
und eine neue Generation von Ingenieuren.  Dafuer muss unser Bildungs-
und Ausbildungssystem auf eine neue Grundlage gestellt werden, die
die digitale Struktur zum zugrundeliegenden Prinzip hat.  Darin
liegen ungeahnte Chancen, freilich auch nicht wenige Gefahren.  Das,
woran IBM, Microsoft und Siemens nicht interessiert waren, werden
kleine risikofreudige Unternehmer bewerkstelligen, die dort ihre
Chance sehen, wo grosse Monopolisten offenbar blind oder schwerfaellig
sind.  In dem grossen Bereich der Betriebssysteme haette Deutschland
mehr zu sagen, als es derzeit (als stiller und zufriedener Kunde)
geschieht.  Auch steht die Integrierung des Computers in die gesamte
gesellschaftliche Infrastruktur (ubiquitous computing) in Deutschland
noch bevor, wobei diese Entwicklung im uebrigen von den
Betriebssystemen entscheidend abhaengt.  Auch kann in dieser Hinsicht
die Umweltpolitik, die in Deutschland traditionellerweise eine grosse
Rolle spielt, durch die Produktion umweltfreundlicher Produkte
profitieren.  Als in Deutschland ein Internetanbieter verurteilt
wurde, weil er den Zugang zu unsittlich-ekelhaften Webseiten moeglich
gemacht hatte, die niemand gutheisst (die sich aber offenbar viele,
auch Deutsche, heimlich anschauen), war das ein denkwuerdiger Vorgang.
Doch muesste man nach der gleichen Logik (oder dem gleichen
juristischen Vor-Urteil) die Bundesbahn dafuer verurteilen, dass sie
Transportmittel bereitstellt, die Frauen nach Holland in die
Abtreibungskliniken bringen, die Lufthansa dafuer, dass sie deutsche
Urlauber in asiatische Laender fliegt, in denen die Kinderprostitution
blueht, und die Telekom und ihre Konkurrenten dafuer, dass ueber ihre
Dienstleistungen Nazipropaganda und terroristische Anleitungen
verbreitet werden.  Um die Moeglichkeiten und Gefahren einer
vernetzten Gesellschaft wirklich abwaegen zu koennen, muss man sich sehr
genau und vorurteilslos mit allen technischen Aspekten, besonders
aber mit den menschlichen und politischen Dimensionen befassen.

Nach allem, was man in den deutschen Medien ueber die vernetzte Welt
lesen kann, ueberrascht es nicht, dass kein Bundesbuerger daran glaubt,
dass ein deutscher Bundeskanzler (egal welcher!) weiss, wie man mit
einer Maus oder mit einem aehnlichen Computerbestandteil umgehen muss.
Hier ist der--zugegeben kontroverse--peruanische Praesident Fujimori
weiter: Er wusste, wie er ueber seinen Laptop an Daten herankam, mit
deren Hilfe er sinnvolle Wirtschaftsprogramme darlegen konnte.  Das
Bild des Deutschen, das sich aus der gegenseitigen Abhaengigkeit der
politischen Praxis in einer stark regulierten Gesellschaft und den
Methoden, mit denen sie ihre Legitimitaet verteidigt, ergibt, ist dann
etwas folgendes: technologisch versiert, technologisch interessiert
und dennoch unwillens, den entscheidenden Schritt vom Ottomotor zur
digitalen Maschine zu gehen.

Um den Umbruch wirklich mitgestalten zu koennen, muessten die Deutschen
ihr jetziges System mit allen seinen Grenzen grundsaetzlich in Frage
stellen.  Sie muessten vor allem ihr Schicksal selbst in die Hand
nehmen und es nicht denjenigen ueberlassen, denen sie bislang ihr
Geschick allzu leichtfertig anvertraut haben.  Eine
Top-down-Strategie, wie ich sie in den vorausgegangenen Kapiteln in
verschiedenen Zusammenhaengen dargestellt habe und wie sie in dem
hierarchisch strukturierten Deutschland besonders wirksam etabliert
ist, waere der falsche Ansatz.  Schauen wir doch den Tatsachen ins
Gesicht: In den vergangenen Jahren haben sich die Politiker in
Deutschland darin ueberboten, eine Arbeitsbeschaffungsmassnahme nach
der anderen zu entwickeln und enorme Summen in sie zu investieren;
nahezu alle zielten auf die Keynessche Lehre von der staatlichen
Intervention ab, die auch in die wahnwitzigen Subventionen fuer die
desolate Kohleindustrie eingegangen ist.  Wirkliche Abhilfe koennte
nur die Einschraenkung staatlicher Eingriffe bringen, ein Rueckzug der
zentralen Staatsgewalt und eine verstaerkte Motivation und Kompetenz
lokaler Einrichtungen, die natuerlich im Netzwerk eingebunden sein
muessen, die gegenseitige Hilfe, aber auch kreativen Wettbewerb
foerdern.  Staatliche Einrichtungen muessten nach denselben Prinzipien
bewertet und bezahlt werden wie die Vorstandsmitglieder grosser
Unternehmen: naemlich nach ihrer Leistung bei der Kostenreduzierung,
bei der Verschlankung der Buerokratie und bei der Staerkung von
Eigeninitiativen.  Derartiges Downsizing wuerde uns vom Wasserkopf der
schriftbasierten Regulierungssucht befreien.  Gute und erfolgreiche
Politik in der heutigen Zeit wuerde zuallererst darin bestehen, die
Regierung mindestens um die Haelfte zu verkleinern.  Ist diese
Sichtweise realistisch?

Gewiss nicht innerhalb eines Modells der zentralen
Mittelvergabe--zentral auf der Ebene der Bundeslaender, des Bundes und
jetzt auch der Europaeischen Union.  Beim gegenwaertigen Stand der
Dinge sieht es eher so aus, als wuerde die Interventionspolitik mit
staatlichen Subventionen Deutschlands Zukunftschancen zerstoeren.  Zu
stark sind die Seilschaften, die Einflussnahme durch Interessengruppen
und der politische Opportunismus: allesamt aus der Schriftkultur und
auf ihr begruendet.  Wo Wettbewerb und Motivation fehlen, herrscht
Mittelmaessigkeit; Transparenz wird durch Regulierung ersetzt.  Einen
wirklichen Wettbewerb im Bereich der gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen
Ausschreibungen von Projekten kann es schon deshalb nicht geben, weil
die Gelder oft schon verteilt sind, bevor die Buerokraten die Ziele
einiger dieser staatlichen Programme festgelegt haben.  Einige
Modethemen beherrschen den politischen Diskurs--ueberfuellte Autobahnen
und Tempolimits, Multimedien, neue Produktstoffe, Umweltschutz--und
rufen entsprechende Aktivitaeten auf Landes- und Bundesebene hervor.
Aber auch hier fliessen die Gelder an die, die in den richtigen
Positionen sitzen oder die richtigen Beziehungen haben und die,
schlimmer noch, die Gutachter ueber diejenigen sind, die aus einer
anderen Position oder einem anderen Blickwinkel heraus diese Probleme
angehen wuerden.  Auch hier foerdert die staatliche Intervention--ganz
wie in Japan--Vorabsprachen und Vorentscheidungen und verhindert
Transparenz.  Im Mittelpunkt steht weniger das Ergebnis als ein
entsprechendes Gutachten: ein weiteres Produkt der Schriftkultur.
Die Hoffnungen mancher Unternehmer, Forscher und akademischer Lehrer,
dass sich diese Situation auf europaeischer Ebene veraendern wuerde, sind
weitgehend enttaeuscht worden.  Buerokratische Strukturen sind am
allerwenigsten fuer Selbstkontrolle und Selbstkorrekturen geeignet.
Je weiter sie sich von ihren Geldgebern entfernen, desto mehr wird
das System der demokratischen Gewaltenkontrolle unterminiert.  Das
Bruesseler Modell, auf dem die Europaeische Union gruendet, wirkt alles
andere als integrativ.  Oft ist es nichts anderes als organisierte
Verschwendung und ueberregulierte Stagnation.  Das gilt ganz besonders
fuer die vielen Kooperationsprogramme, fuer die erhebliche Summen zur
Verfuegung stehen.  In dem verzweifelten Bemuehen, Forschern und
Studenten der verschiedenen Mitgliedslaender die Zusammenarbeit zu
erleichtern, werden kuenstliche und in mancherlei Hinsicht
unangemessene sogenannte Partnerschaften gegruendet.  Natuerlich gibt
es hier auch Erfolge zu vermelden.  Im grossen und ganzen jedoch hat
die eilige Suche nach Partneruniversitaeten und der damit verbundene
erhebliche Verwaltungsaufwand nur zu neuen buerokratischen Strukturen
und Organisationsformen gefuehrt.  Man kommt sich nicht naeher, indem
man Mitteln hinterherlaeuft, die opportunistisch verteilt werden.  Auf
dem Papier sieht alles sehr gut aus; aber die Wirklichkeit hat mit
den guten Intentionen leider nur sehr wenig zu tun.

Die Alternative zu diesen Maengeln waeren kleine, selbstregulierende
Einheiten, die ohne diese buerokratischen Regulierungen in einen fuer
alle transparenten Wettbewerb eintreten.  Erst wenn die Studenten in
Deutschland und in den anderen europaeischen Laendern nach einem kurzen,
aber zielorientierten Studium mit Eigeninitiativen in den
Berufsmarkt eintreten, statt an den Universitaeten fuer ein manchmal
Jahrzehnte dauerndes Studium eingeschrieben zu bleiben, haette sich
wirklich Wesentliches veraendert.  Erst wenn die deutschen Professoren
ihren Beamtenstatus (und die damit verbundenen Privilegien einer
Lebenszeitanstellung, hoher Sozialleistungen und einer gesicherten
Pension) gegen riskante, aber sinnvolle und auch Genugtuung bringende
wissenschaftliche Herausforderungen eintauschen wuerden, haetten wir
einen alle ueberzeugenden Kontext fuer Kreativitaet und Kompetenz
geschaffen.  Schliesslich und vor allem aber muss sich die Wissenschaft
aus der schuetzenden Umarmung des Staates loesen und noch mehr als
bisher in den Wettbewerb um Ideen und Methoden eintreten.  Dann erst
waere in Deutschland ein Umfeld geschaffen, in dem sich Kreativitaet
gegen Selbstzufriedenheit, Redundanz und reine Beschaeftigungstherapie
durchgesetzt haette.  Die unglaubliche Produktivitaet, die derzeit fuer
die Beantragung von Forschungsgeldern aufgewendet wird, ist lediglich
ein Symptom dafuer, dass die Wissenschaft (und die Kuenste, die sehr
aehnlichen Mechanismen unterliegen), noch immer Geiseln der
Schriftkultur sind.  Wirkliche alternative Mittel und Methoden, wie
etwa multimediale Praesentationen oder netzwerkgestuetzter Wettbewerb
um Forschungsgelder, werden weder akzeptiert noch wird dazu ermutigt.
Das ueberrascht und enttaeuscht, wissen wir doch, dass wirklicher
Wettbewerb in Wissenschaft und Bildung mindestens so wichtig ist wie
im Geschaeftsleben.  Im gegenwaertigen System ist in Deutschland
Misslingen de facto ausgeschlossen, denn es wuerde dem oeffentlichen
Ansehen schaden.  Es waere in diesem Zusammenhang vielleicht ganz
wichtig, wenn man sich die Folgen vor Augen hielte, die diese Art von
Selbsttaeuschung in anderen Laendern bewirkt hat.

Unter der protektionistischen Atmosphaere, die im frueheren Sowjetblock
Wissenschaft, Kunst und Bildung beherrschte, haben Wissenschaftler,
Kuenstler und eminente Universitaetsprofessoren hoechst qualifizierte
Arbeit geleistet, aber diese hatte ueberhaupt keine Auswirkungen auf
die Gesellschaft gehabt.  Man zollte ihnen Lob und gewaehrte ihnen
einen besseren Lebensstandard als den Durchschnittsbuergern.  Aber in
dem Land, das seit jeher die besten Mathematiker und Logiker
hervorbringt--die nun alle ausserhalb ihres Landes leben und
arbeiten--, wurden die Computer nicht auf der Grundlage ihrer
theoretischen Arbeit gebaut, sondern als Kopien von Computern, die
aus dem Westen illegal eingeschmuggelt waren.  Mit der heute ueblichen
Vermischung von Staatssozialismus und Marktwirtschaft naehert sich
Deutschland auf gefaehrliche Weise jenen Zustaenden, die zum
Zusammenbruch der osteuropaeischen Gesellschaften gefuehrt haben und
die man voellig zu Recht wegen ihrer mangelnden Flexibilitaet und
Innovationsangst kritisiert hat.  Die Deutschen bezweifeln die
offiziellen Inflations-, Arbeitslosenund Kriminalitaetsraten, ohne
allerdings dabei die Politik der schriftkulturellen Selbsttaeuschung,
die solche Zahlen hervorbringt, in Frage zu stellen.

Die politischen Fuehrer Deutschlands--gleich welcher Couleur--sind
weder verlogen noch unfaehig, die Komplexitaet der heutigen Situation
zu erfassen.  Der politische Diskurs und die politische Streitkultur
haben in Deutschland eine Ebene erreicht, um die es die meisten
anderen Laender beneiden.  Die politischen Skandale, die die USA fuer
die restliche Welt der Laecherlichkeit preisgeben, sind hier nahezu
unbekannt.  Was aber fehlt, sind der Mut und die Bereitschaft, jene
Wege zu verlassen, die die beispielhafte soziale Tradition
Deutschlands markiert haben, die aber inzwischen Holzwege geworden
sind.  Die Politiker sprechen heute leichtfertig ueber die
Gesellschaft und deren Verpflichtungen gegenueber dem Buerger, aber die
Gesellschaft, von der sie reden, gibt es gar nicht mehr.  Sie berufen
sich auf einen Sozialvertrag, der durch die egoistischen Motivationen
der Buerger jenseits der Schriftkultur tatsaechlich ueberholt wurde, ob
es uns passt oder nicht.  Deutschland ist in einem Masse auf seine
Vergangenheit fixiert, dass niemand auch nur auf den Gedanken kommt,
dass die Bewahrung der Tradition in der Zukunft nicht mehr die einzig
denkbare Alternative ist, so gut sie auch klingen mag.

Konkreter heisst das, dass man entschiedener von einer Produktions- zu
einer Dienstleistungsgesellschaft voranschreiten muss.  Der Zugang zur
Tradition kann auch durch andere als durch schriftkulturelle Mittel
geschaffen werden.  Natuerlich kann man verstopfte Strassen und
Autobahnen dadurch entlasten, dass man neue und groessere Strassen baut;
auf Dauer wuerde das aber nicht viel aendern, denn als Folge davon
wuerden die Menschen nur noch mehr Autos kaufen.  Die mechanische
Mobilitaet, fuer die wir einen hohen oekologischen und menschlichen
Preis bezahlen muessen, sollte zumindest in Teilen durch den digitalen
Zugang und die digitale Verbreitung von Wissen ersetzt werden.
Physische Kopraesenz (die die geselligen Deutschen so lieben) koennte
teilweise durch virtuelle Praesenz ersetzt werden.  Es geht laengst
nicht mehr um die Menge der verarbeiteten Rohstoffe, sondern um die
Menge der freigelegten kognitiven Ressourcen.  Auf dem Weg vom
denkwuerdigen Bauhaus zum neuen Denkhaus der Moeglichkeiten zeichnen
sich viele Wege ab, um aus der Tradition, die heute vielfach nur als
Last erscheint, eine Quelle der Erneuerung zu machen.

AEhnlich stellt sich die soziale Tradition Deutschlands dar.  Bei der
Regelung der sozialen Aspekte des Daseins gilt Deutschland in
vielerlei Hinsicht dem Rest der Welt als Beispiel.  Die sozialen
Leistungen sind vermutlich die besten in der westlichen Welt.
Bildung und Ausbildung geniessen selbst in wirtschaftlichen
Krisenzeiten absolute Prioritaet und werden gaenzlich durch den
Steuerzahler finanziert.  Lebensqualitaet, wie sie sich im
Lebensstandard, im Reisen, im Gesundheitswesen, in der Laenge der
Urlaubszeit und im Bildungsangebot ausdrueckt, ist ein Grundrecht
geworden.  Doch zeichnet sich mittlerweile ab, dass Deutschland diesen
beneidenswerten Status nur auf Kosten anderer erhalten kann, es sei
denn, neue, innovative Impulse wuerden die Effizienz durch andere
Faktoren als nur durch Groessenordnungen erhoehen.  Eine schmerzliche
Alternative wird darin liegen, einige der hart erarbeiteten
Leistungen gegen neue Moeglichkeiten einzutauschen.

Die erste Option--auf Kosten anderer zu leben--haette nur kurzfristig
Chancen.  In weniger als einer Generation wird sich zeigen, dass man
fuer die Erhaltung des hohen Lebensstandards in einigen Laendern
(Deutschland, Frankreich, Italien, Schweden) nicht mehr einfach
andere zahlen lassen kann.  Hierbei wird der politische
Zusammenschluss Europas eine grosse Rolle spielen.  Niemand kann
ernsthaft davon ausgehen, dass es moeglich ist, die grossen Unterschiede
zwischen den deutschen Leistungen im Sozial- und Gesundheitswesen und
denen in anderen europaeischen Laendern beibehalten zu koennen.  Um aber
die anderen Laender zu einem vergleichbaren Standard zu fuehren, muessten
Mittel aufgebracht werden, die schlichtweg nicht zur Verfuegung stehen.
Das wuerde bedeuten, dass der allgemeine Lebensstandard zum Zweck der
allgemeinen Angleichung in Deutschland gesenkt werden muss.  Die
zweite Option--technologische Innovationen, die die deutsche
Fuehrungsrolle in diesem Bereich staerken--wuerde sich ebenfalls nicht
sehr lange auswirken.  Die Wissensverbreitung in einer global
vernetzten Welt wird sich noch schneller als bisher vollziehen, so
dass auch Fuehrungskonzepte in innovativen Bereichen jeweils sehr viel
kuerzer existieren werden.  Also sind gesellschaftliche
Reformen--unsere dritte Option--angezeigt, so schwer diese Medizin
auch zu schlucken ist.  Diese werden sich vermutlich durch eine
gewisse Absenkung des Lebensstandards durchsetzen lassen.  Dafuer aber
werden neue Moeglichkeiten entstehen, und das Leben wird sich weniger
als Umsetzung von Vorschriften und mehr als Entfaltung der
Verschiedenheiten, die uns als Individuen definieren, darstellen.

Gibt es Grund zur Besorgnis?  Zwischen 1970 und heute ist das
Geldvermoegen der privaten deutschen Haushalte von 524 Milliarden DM
auf 5344 Milliarden DM angestiegen (Immobilien und Betriebsvermoegen
nicht eingerechnet).  Das heisst, dass jeder deutsche Haushalt
durchschnittlich 150000 DM besitzt.  Wenn unter den heutigen
Bedingungen erhoehter wirtschaftlicher Effektivitaet diese enormen
Summen nicht aktiviert werden, dann sind sie bald weniger wert als
all die Nullen, die man zum Schreiben dieser Zahlen benoetigt.
Jenseits der Schriftkultur etabliert sich ein Bereich der
Mitbeteiligung und Mitbestimmung, der allein soziale Gleichheit und
Qualitaetsmassstaebe garantiert.

In den vergangenen Jahren hat der Druck des Marktes zu Reformen
gefuehrt, die in der Gesellschaft Zweifel an der Globalitaet (als
koennte man sich ihr entziehen) haben aufkommen lassen, weil man sie
fuer einige der verlorenen Sozialleistungen verantwortlich macht.  Im
gleichen Zug wurden Wettbewerb, Marktwirtschaft und sogar die nach
dem Zweiten Weltkrieg erworbene Toleranz gegenueber Fremden in Zweifel
gezogen.  "Deutschland ist kein Einwanderungsland" ist nicht nur der
Kampfruf einer kleinen reaktionaeren Minderheit, sondern eine durchaus
verbreitete Einstellung--sind die Gruenen hier eine Ausnahme?--, mit
der man die Fremden zum Suendenbock fuer alle moeglichen politischen
Probleme erklaert.  Das Fremde wird in Deutschland nur unter
spezifisch deutschen Gesichtspunkten akzeptiert: als Urlaubsrefugium
(Mallorca, Tunesien, die Dominikanische Republik, Tuerkei), wo man
seine Sorgen fuer einen Augenblick vergessen kann; als billiges
Reiseziel fuer Arbeitslose oder fuer diejenigen, die ihre Autos
billiger als in Deutschland kaufen moechten; oder als Ort (Polen,
Rumaenien, die Tschechische Republik), an dem Personen mit kleineren
Pensionsanspruechen besser als zu Hause leben koennen.  Die Einsicht,
dass die Welt jenseits der Schriftkultur eine integrierte Welt ist,
stellt sich nur in Ausnahmefaellen ein, ungeachtet der Bedeutung, die
diesem Thema im offiziellen politischen Diskurs beigemessen wird.
Dass Deutschland wie alle anderen Laender in Zukunft hoehere
Einwanderungszahlen zu verzeichnen haben wird, ist nicht nur eine
Moeglichkeit, sondern eine Notwendigkeit.  Ohne Einwanderung wuerde
Deutschland zu einem geistigen Mikrokosmos zusammenschrumpfen, dem
die wiederbelebenden Impulse fremder Kulturen fehlen; abgesehen davon,
dass es nicht genuegend qualifiziert ausgebildete junge Menschen in
allen Arbeitsbereichen haette.  Jenseits der Schriftkultur ergibt sich
Dynamik aus Unterschieden, nicht aus Uniformitaet.

Den fundamentalen pragmatischen Zusammenhang von Arbeit und Leben in
einer integrierten Welt, deren Sprache die Sprache des Konsums ist,
hat man in Deutschland nie wirklich verstanden.  Deutschlands
fuehrende Denker widmen sich nahezu ausschliesslich der Vergangenheit
und warten mit immer neuen Auslegungen von ihr auf.  Wenn Reformen
(von denen die meisten ohnehin nur akute Brandherde loeschen statt
neue Wege aufzuzeigen) durchgesetzt werden muessen--wie im Fall der
Lohnfortzahlung oder von Rationalisierungsmassnahmen in der
Wirtschaft--schallt der Ruf "Wir wollen keine amerikanischen
Verhaeltnisse."  Als haetten die Krisen, die die Probleme in der
Stahlindustrie, in der Automobilindustrie oder in der Chemie- und
Pharmaindustrie hervorgerufen haben, nichts mit den Problemen zu tun,
die auch in Amerika und in allen anderen Laendern zu Krisen und zu
erhoehtem Wettbewerb, und im uebrigen zu erhoehter Wettbewerbsfaehigkeit,
gefuehrt haben.  Wenn die Deutschen ihren Lebensstandard erhalten
wollen, muessen sie wie alle anderen Staaten Alternativen finden.
Stagnation ist keine Alternative, sondern eine Sackgasse.
Manteltarifvertraege zum Beispiel, die einer Welt, die immer
differenzierter wird, Uniformitaet aufzwingen wollen, helfen nicht
weiter.  Viele andere Probleme, die sich aus der festen Bindung an
die Tradition ergeben, beduerfen innovativer Alternativen.  Zu lange
hat man in Deutschland aus Selbstzufriedenheit und Mittelmaessigkeit
zukunftsgerichtete Initiativen und Erneuerungsimpulse verworfen.

Ein besonders auffaelliges Beispiel ist der Zustand des deutschen
Universitaetssystems.  Einst gab die deutsche Universitaet das Muster
fuer viele andere Laender ab und zog Studenten aus aller Welt an.
Heute ist das Universitaetssystem vornehmlich damit beschaeftigt, allen,
die es wollen, einen freien Zugang zu einer mittelmaessigen Bildung
und Ausbildung zu gewaehren.  Viele Universitaeten kaempfen ums
UEberleben, obwohl Deutschland auf dem Papier die hoechsten
Studentenzahlen der ganzen Welt hat.  Die derzeitigen Finanzprobleme
machen sich hier besonders bemerkbar: ueberall fehlt es an Geld,
verbeamtete Professoren kosten mehr, als sich die Gesellschaft
leisten kann; die auf eine illustre Geschichte zurueckgehenden
Studienplaene wurden in fast keinem Fall auf die neue Lebenspraxis
ausgerichtet.  Die kostbare Bildung, eine Errungenschaft, auf die
Deutschland so stolz blickt, ist sehr kostspielig geworden.  Unter
dem Druck der Verhaeltnisse werden Reformen in Angriff genommen--fuer
das Jahr 2006. Niemand fragt dabei, ob unter den gegebenen Umstaenden
des technologischen Fortschritts und der rasanten wissenschaftlichen
Entwicklung im Jahr 2006 die Universitaeten ueberhaupt noch die
richtigen Institutionen fuer Bildung und Ausbildung sind.  Wenn neue
Universitaeten und Fachhochschulen gegruendet werden, geschieht dies
immer noch nach dem mittelalterlichen Modell, das sich an einem
einige Jahrhunderte alten Bildungsideal orientiert, aber die heute
erforderliche Effizienz eher verhindert.  Spektabilitaeten und
Magnifizenzen, von denen einige als Hochschullehrer versagt haben,
produzieren Unmengen von beschriebenem Papier, die viel Mittelmass
erkennen und jegliche bildungspolitische Perspektive vermissen lassen.
Sofern die Studienplaene in Einzelheiten veraendert werden, dauert es
Jahre, bis sie durch die universitaeren Gremien gelaufen und von den
Ministerien genehmigt worden sind.  Die universitaetsinterne
Mittelverteilung orientiert sich ebenfalls nicht an zukuenftigen
Beduerfnissen.  Den Rektoren und Kanzlern stehen Dienstwagen mit
Chauffeur zur Verfuegung, waehrend es in einigen Unterrichtsraeumen
selbst an Tafeln fehlt, von den neuen Multimedien und den
wissenschaftlichen Netzwerken gar nicht zu reden.  Wettbewerb unter
den Professoren ist oft nicht ein Wettbewerb um bessere Arbeits- und
Forschungsbedingungen, sondern um hoehere Institutshaushalte oder
Gehaelter.  All diese Regeln und Strukturen haben sich aus der
sogenannten Autonomie der Hochschulen ergeben.  Strukturreformen mit
Blick auf die heute notwendigen interdisziplinaeren Forschungszentren
und eine entsprechend neu orientierte akademische Lehre werden durch
diese Verhaeltnisse schwer, bisweilen sogar unmoeglich gemacht.  An
deutschen Universitaeten gilt noch immer als hoechstes Prinzip: Stecke
dein Gebiet ab, wahre deinen Besitzstand!  Und das in einer Zeit, in
der in sich geschlossene, autonome Wissenschaftseinrichtungen kaum
noch irgendwelche relevanten Forschungstaetigkeiten durchfuehren koennen.

Die deutsche Universitaet ist vermutlich mehr als alle anderen
Bereiche der Gesellschaft auf die (sehr glorreiche) Vergangenheit
fixiert.  Entsprechend fehlt den Studierenden die noetige, auf
zukuenftigen Erfolg ausgerichtete Motivation.  So schaffen sie sich
Lebensbedingungen, in welchen das Studium im Vergleich zu den anderen
Lebenserwartungen eine relativ marginale Rolle spielt.  Studenten
machen Urlaub unabhaengig von den Vorlesungszeiten.  Ihre
Nebentaetigkeit ist ihnen oft wichtiger als Seminare und
wissenschaftlichen Projekte; denn wissenschaftliche Leistung ergibt
sich kaum noch aus dem Beduerfnis nach wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnis,
sondern aus der Notwendigkeit, Scheine zu sammeln.  Wo sollten sie
auch diese Leistungsqualitaet suchen und finden?  Sicher nicht bei den
Professoren, die nur auftauchen, wenn ihre anderen Verpflichtungen es
ihnen erlauben, oder bei denen, die ihre intellektuelle Entwicklung
mit der Verbeamtung beendet haben.  Die politischen Aktivitaeten der
Studierenden richten sich ebenfalls auf Fragen des Lebensstandards,
nicht auf ungenuegende Lehrplaene, sondern auf Sozialleistungen wie
BAFoeG, das Recht auf unbegrenztes Studium, Preisermaessigungen aller
Art, freien Zugang zum Internet und billiges Mensaessen.

Jede Verallgemeinerung ist falsch und gefaehrlich, und es hilft auch
nicht viel weiter, immer nur mit dem Finger auf die derzeitigen
Symptome zu zeigen.  Ich verfolge hier lediglich die Absicht, das
offen auszusprechen, was viele Kollegen untereinander diskutieren und
in Privatgespraechen bestaetigen.  Sie tun nichts dagegen, weil sie
befuerchten, dass man dagegen nichts mehr tun kann.  Natuerlich gibt es
noch immer diejenigen, die unter grossen persoenlichen Opfern
hochkaraetige Forschung betreiben, mit Kollegen aus anderen
Disziplinen erfolgreich zusammenarbeiten und ihre Studierenden
motivieren.  Es waere unfair, das nicht festzustellen.  Es ist
allerdings auch kontraproduktiv, die erheblichen Probleme des
deutschen Universitaetssystems hinter den Erfolgsmeldungen zu
verstecken: das wuerde den Zynismus in der akademischen Welt nur
erhoehen.

Ein wichtiger Schritt bei der Reform des deutschen
Universitaetssystems bestuende darin, dass sich die Universitaeten
ernsthaft um eine OEffnung fuer alternative Ausdrucks- und
Kommunikationsmittel bemuehen.  Des weiteren muessten ihre
Entscheidungsstrukturen dezentralisiert und der Verwaltungsapparat
insgesamt eingeschraenkt werden.  Wichtiger als neue Hochschulbauten
sind Netzwerke fuer wissenschaftliche Interaktion; wichtiger als neue
Studien- und Pruefungsordnungen waeren UEberlegungen, wie man die
universitaere Ausbildung auf die zukuenftigen Beduerfnisse der
Gesellschaft ausrichten koennte.  Statt Uniformitaet muessten das
Aussergewoehnliche, das Unterschiedliche, das Innovative gefoerdert
werden, auch und gerade im Bereich der unterschiedlichen
Intelligenzen und Veranlagungen.  Jegliche Form von geistiger
Kreativitaet in eine uniforme Bildung zu zwaengen, hiesse die von der
Schriftkultur propagierte Demokratie falsch zu interpretieren.

In vielerlei Hinsicht aehnelt die Situation in Deutschland dem, was
ich in der englischen Fassung des vorliegenden Buches ausfuehrlicher
als Asienkrise dargestellt habe.  Es waere schoen, wenn eine
europaeische Krise, die ganz wesentlich von der Art und Weise abhaengt,
wie Deutschland (aber nicht nur!) mit seinen Problemen umgeht, durch
die weitsichtigen Handlungen derer vermieden wuerde, die etwas
bewirken koennten.

Ich habe wiederholt darauf hingewiesen, wie notwendig eine proaktive
Haltung ist.  Und hier, das sei noch einmal in aller Deutlichkeit
festgestellt, muss das Bildungssystem als wichtige Quelle der
Erneuerung eine Fuehrungsrolle uebernehmen und darf sich nicht mit der
Rolle eines passiven Zeugen der Stagnation begnuegen.  Deregulierung,
Dezentralisierung und eine Befreiung von hierarchischen Strukturen
waeren die Stuetzpfeiler eines zukunftsweisenden politischen Konzepts.
Viele deutsche Unternehmen haben kompetitive Methoden wie
Aufgabenverteilung und parallele Arbeitsablaeufe bereits umgesetzt.
Die Anbindung an Netzwerke wird gerade vollzogen.  In den Betrieben
und den Entwicklungsabteilungen der grossen Unternehmen wird die
Schriftkultur zunehmend durch eine Kultur des Visuellen und durch
Multimedien ersetzt.  Viele Studierende, die in diesem Bereich viel
weiter sind als ihre Professoren, uebernehmen die Rolle von Lehrenden
und fuellen das Ausbildungsvakuum im Bereich der neuen Technologien.
Noch wichtiger jedoch waere es zu erkennen, dass sich die Dynamik des
Umbruchs aus kleineren, selbstorganisierenden Zellen ergibt.

Manche studentischen Versuche, die Herdenmentalitaet des
Bildungssystems (und der deutschen Gesellschaft) zu ueberwinden und
nach Bildungsalternativen zu suchen, sind geradezu aufregend.  Statt
in ueberfuellten Hoersaelen Vorlesungen zu lauschen, die der Professor
zum soundsovielten Male wiederholt, erforschen sie das World Wide Web,
studieren im Ausland, kuemmern sich in der studentischen
Selbstverwaltung um Raeume und Ausruestung, ohne sich dabei gross um die
vorgeschriebenen buerokratischen Wege zu scheren.  Das sind solche
selbstorganisierenden Zellen, aus denen die spaeteren neuen
Kleinunternehmen hervorgehen oder aus denen sich moeglicherweise
Alternativen zu dem Monstrum entwickeln, das wir Universitaet nennen.
Diese kleinen innovativen Unternehmen im Umfeld der Universitaeten
halten die Beziehungen zur Universitaet aufrecht, ermoeglichen
Wissenstransfer und auch eine staerker an der Wirklichkeit
ausgerichtete Ausbildung.

Ein deutscher Politiker, der gern im Rampenlicht steht, hat
vorgeschlagen, die Universitaeten zu verkaufen, weil sie vom Staat
nicht mehr zu finanzieren sind.  Das koennte ein erster Schritt sein,
die verbuerokratisierte Verwaltung zum Sonderpreis anzubieten.  Damit
waere eine wichtige Voraussetzung zur Konstituierung von
selbstorganisierenden Zentren innerhalb des Universitaetssystems
geschaffen, die zu einer wirklichen Autonomie der Hochschulen fuehren
koennte.  Solche selbstorganisierenden Zellen entstehen ueberall, wo
die Bedingungen fuer einen Wandel von denen, die die gegenwaertige
Dynamik verstanden und Initiativen ergriffen haben, geschaffen werden.
Ein gutes Beispiel hierfuer ist Jenoptik, ein Unternehmen, das
gerade an die Boerse gegangen ist, nachdem es die traditionellen
Produktionsweisen, die den frueheren Ruhm begruendet hatten, durch neue
Produkte und Produktionsformen ersetzt hat.  Hier werden auch neue
Formen der Mitarbeitermotivierung erprobt, in Form von
Aktienanrechten, die den Bedingungen eines wettbewerbsorientierten
Marktes viel angemessener sind als die maechtigen Tarifvertraege
zwischen Arbeitgebern und Arbeitnehmern.  AEhnliche Beispiele, auch
wenn sie leider eher selten sind, wird der Leser selber kennen.  So
wichtig Stabilitaet in den Augen von Paedagogen, Wissenschaftlern,
Gelehrten und vor allem Verwaltungsangestellten auch sein mag, Formen
der Selbstorganisation sind kennzeichnend fuer ein dynamisches System,
nicht fuer schale Stabilitaet oder Egoismus.  "Il faut laissez faire
les hommes.": Diese Feststellung Colberts aus dem 17. Jahrhundert hat
Bismarck ueberdauert, nicht, weil die den Deutschen so lieb gewordenen
Tugenden von Ordnung und Disziplin schlecht sind, sondern weil sich
jenseits der Schriftkultur ein Bereich entfaltet, in dem sich die
erfolgreiche menschliche Selbstkonstituierung ausschliesslich auf
menschliche Ressourcen gruendet.  Die Faehigkeit zum Umdenken ist eine
solche Ressource.
