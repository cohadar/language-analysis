Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of November, 2001, contributions are being solicited from people

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer 
to
donate.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm 
etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States 
copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

Vorwort zur deutschen Ausgabe

Unsere Welt ist in Unordnung geraten.  Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist eine
grosse Belastung fuer alle.  Sozialleistungen werden weiter drastisch
gekuerzt.  Das Universitaetssystem befindet sich im Umbruch.  Politik,
Wirtschaft und Arbeitswelt durchlaufen Veraenderungen, die sich nicht
nach dem gewohnten ordentlichen Muster des sogenannten Fortschritts
richten.  Gleichwohl verfolgen Politiker aller Couleur politische
Programme, die mit den eigentlichen Problemen und Herausforderungen
in Deutschland (und in Europa) nicht das Geringste zu tun haben.  Das
vorliegende Buch moechte sich diesen Herausforderungen widmen, aus
einer Perspektive, die die Zwangslaeufigkeit dieser Entwicklung betont.

Wenn man eine Hypothese vorstellt, benoetigt man ein geeignetes
Prueffeld.  In meinen Augen ist Deutschland am besten dafuer geeignet.
In keinem anderen Land der Welt laesst sich die Dramatik des Umbruchs
so unmittelbar verfolgen wie hier.  In Deutschland treffen die Kraefte
und Werte, die zu den grossen historischen Errungenschaften und den
katastrophalen historischen Fehlleistungen dieses Landes gefuehrt
haben, mit den neuen Kraeften und Werten, die das Gesicht der Welt
veraendern, gewissermassen in Reinform zusammen.

An Ordnung, Disziplin und Fortschritt gewoehnt, beklagen die Buerger
heute eine allgegenwaertige laehmende Buerokratie, die von Regierung und
Verwaltung ausgeht.  Frueher galt das, verbunden mit dem Namen
Bismarcks, als gute deutsche Tugend, eine der vielen
Qualitaetsmaschinen „Made in Germany“.  Im Verlauf der Zeit aber wurde
der Buerger abhaengig von ihr und konnte sich nicht vorstellen, jemals
ohne sie auszukommen.  Die Mehrheit schreckt vor Alternativen zurueck
und moechte nicht einmal ueber sie nachdenken.  Gepraegt von Technik und
Qualitaetsarbeit ist die Vorstellung, dass das Industriezeitalter
seinem Ende entgegengeht, den meisten eine Schreckensvision.  Sie
wuerden eher ihre Schrebergaerten hergeben als die digitale Autobahn zu
akzeptieren, die doch die Staus auf ihren richtigen Autobahnen zu den
Hauptverkehrszeiten abbauen koennte--ich betone das „koennte“.  Noch
immer lebt es sich gut durch den Export eines technischen und
wissenschaftlichen Know-how, dessen Glanzzeit allerdings vorueber ist.

Als ein hochzivilisiertes Land ist Deutschland fest entschlossen, den
barbarischen Teil seiner Vergangenheit hinter sich zu lassen.  Der
Klarheit halber sei gesagt, was ich unter barbarisch verstehe:
Hitler-Deutschland verdient keinen anderen Namen, ebensowenig wie
alle anderen AEusserungen von Aggression, Antisemitismus und Rassismus,
die noch immer nicht der Vergangenheit angehoeren.  Aber bis heute hat
man nicht verstanden, dass eben jene pragmatische Struktur, die die
industrielle Kraft Deutschlands begruendete, auch die destruktiven
Kraefte beguenstigte.  (Man denke nur an die Technologieexporte, die
die wahnsinnigen Fuehrer oelreicher Laender erst juengst in die Haende
bekommen haben.) Das wiedervereinigte Deutschland ist bereit, in
einer Welt mit globalen Aufgaben und globalen Problemen Verantwortung
zu uebernehmen.  Es setzt sich unter anderem fuer den Schutz des
tropischen Regenwaldes ein und zahlt fuer Werte--den Schutz der
Umwelt--statt fuer Produkte.  Aber die politischen Fuehrer Deutschlands
und mit ihnen grosse Teile der Bevoelkerung haben noch nicht begriffen,
dass der Osten des Landes nicht unbedingt ein Duplikat des Westens
werden muss, damit beide Teile zusammenpassen.  Differenz, d. h.
Andersartigkeit, ist eine Qualitaet, die sich in Deutschland keiner
grossen Wertschaetzung erfreut.  Verlorene Chancen sind der Preis, den
Deutschland fuer diese preussische Tugend der Gleichmacherei bezahlen
muss.

Die englische Originalfassung dieses Buches wurde 1997 auf der
Leipziger Buchmesse vorgestellt und in der Folge von der Kritik
wohlwollend aufgenommen.  Dank der grosszuegigen Unterstuetzung durch
die Mittelsten-Scheid Stiftung Wuppertal und die Alfred und Claere
Pott Stiftung Essen, fuer die ich an dieser Stelle noch einmal Dank
sage, konnte dann Anfang 1998 die Realisierung des von Beginn an
bestehenden Plans einer deutschsprachigen Ausgabe konkret ins Auge
gefasst werden.  Und nachdem Prof. Dr. Norbert Greiner, bei dem ich
mich hier ebenfalls herzlich bedanken moechte, fuer die UEbersetzung
gewonnen war, konnte zuegig an die Erarbeitung einer gegenueber der
englischen Ausgabe deutlich komprimierten und staerker auf den
deutschsprachigen Diskussionskontext zugeschnittenen deutschen
Ausgabe gegangen werden.  Einige Kapitel der Originalausgabe sind in
der deutschsprachigen Edition entfallen, andere wurden stark
ueberarbeitet.  Entfallen sind vor allem solche Kapitel, die sich in
ihren inhaltlichen Bezuegen einem deutschen Leser nicht unmittelbar
erschliessen wuerden.  Ein Nachwort, das sich ausschliesslich an die
deutschen Leser wendet, wurde ergaenzt.

Die deutsche Fassung ist also eigentlich ein anderes Buch.  Wer das
Thema erweitern und vertiefen moechte, ist selbstverstaendich
eingeladen, auf die englische Version zurueckzugreifen, in die 15
Jahre intensiver Forschung, Beobachtung und Erfahrung mit der neuen
Technologie und der amerikanischen Kultur eingegangen sind.  Ein
Vorzug der kompakten deutschen Version liegt darin, dass die juengsten
Entwicklungen--die so schnell vergessen sein werden wie alle anderen
Tagesthemen--„Fortsetzungen“ meiner Argumente darstellen und sie
gewissermassen kommentieren.  Sie haben wenig miteinander zu tun und
sind dennoch in den folgenden Kapiteln antizipiert: Guildos Auftritt
beim Grand Prix d’Eurovision (liebt er uns eigentlich immer noch, und
warum ist das so wichtig?), die enttaeuschende Leistung der deutschen
Nationalmannschaft bei der Fussballweltmeisterschaft (standen sich im
Endspiel Brasilien und Frankreich oder Nike und Adidas gegenueber?),
die Asienkrise, das Ergebnis der Bundestagswahlen, der Euro, neue
Entwicklungen in Wissenschaft und Technologie, die juengsten
Arbeitslosenzahlen, die OEkosteuer und vieles mehr.  Wer sich der Muehe
einer gruendlichen Lektuere des vorliegenden Buches unterzieht, wird
sich auf diese Entwicklungen einen eigenen Reim machen koennen, sehr
viel besser als die Mediengurus, die uns das Denken abnehmen wollen.
Zumindest wird er ueber die wortreichen Artikel halbgebildeter
Akademiker und opportunistischer Journalisten schmunzeln, die allzeit
bereit sind, anderen zu erklaeren, was sie selbst nicht verstehen.

Wie in der englischen Version moechte ich auch meine deutschen Leser
einladen, mit mir in Kontakt zu treten und mir ihre kritischen
Kommentare oder Fragen per e-mail zukommen zu lassen: nadin@acm.org.
Im Einklang mit dem Ziel des Buches, fuer die Kommunikation jenseits

Kapitel 1:


Sprache und Bild

Photo, Film und Fernsehen haben die Welt mehr veraendert als
Gutenbergs Druckmaschine.  Besonders Film und Fernsehen bekommen die
Schuld fuer den Niedergang der Schrift- und Lesekultur zugeschrieben,
in juengerer Zeit kommen Computerspiele und das Internet als Schuldige
dazu.  Weltweit hat man in Untersuchungen herauszufinden versucht,
wie diese Medien unsere Lesegewohnheiten, Schreibfaehigkeit,
Sprachverwendung und Sprachverstehen beeinflusst haben.  Die
Aktionsformen und die Verbreitung von Informationen ueber
elektronische Medien und das World Wide Web sind ebenfalls unter
vergleichenden Gesichtspunkten untersucht worden.  Daraus konnten
Schlussfolgerungen gezogen werden ueber den Einfluss verschiedener
Schrifttypen auf Art und Umfang der PrintProdukte und auf die
Veraenderungen der Schreibweisen (in Romanen, wissenschaftlichen
Texten, in der Geschaeftskorrespondenz, in Handbuechern, in Lyrik und
Dramatik, sogar in der persoenlichen Korrespondenz).

In einigen Laendern verfuegt jeder Haushalt ueber ein Fernsehgeraet, in
manchen ueber mehr als eines. 1995 wurden mehr Computer als
Fernsehgeraete verkauft.  In vielen Laendern haben die meisten Kinder
ausgiebige Fernseh- und Filmerfahrungen, bevor sie lesen koennen; in
einigen Laendern koennen sie sogar Computerspiele bedienen, bevor sie
ein Buch in die Hand bekommen.  Waehrend der Grundschulzeit verbringen
sie dann mehr Zeit vor dem Fernsehapparat als mit Buechern.  Die
Erwachsenen, die heute zur vierten oder fuenften Fernsehgeneration
gehoeren, sind in noch groesserem Masse Bildern ausgesetzt.  Einiges
davon geschieht in freier Entscheidung--Fernsehsendungen, Kinofilme,
Videokassetten und CD-ROMs. Andere Bilder werden ihnen an ihrem
Arbeitsplatz, beim Arzt, bei der Ausuebung ihres Hobbys und durch die
Werbung aufgenoetigt.  Das Interesse an Fernsehen und Videotechnik
wuchs, als Aufnahme- und Abspieltechnik auch dem Laien leicht
zugaenglich wurden.  Heute kann fuer jeden familiaeren, schulischen oder
beruflichen Anlass ein umfangreiches Videoarchiv angelegt werden.  Das
Kabelfernsehen ermoeglicht ohne weiteren groesseren Aufwand die
Produktion eigener Fernsehprogramme.  Durch die verfuegbaren
Netzwerksysteme (Kabel, Satellit, Radiowellen) koennen Bilder von den
entlegensten Orten an alle Haushalte, Schulen und Bibliotheken
uebermittelt werden, was die Beziehung zwischen Eltern und Kindern und
das Verhaeltnis beider zu Sprache, Bildung und Schriftkultur
beeinflusst.  Ohne allzu grossen Aufwand kann jeder seine eigene CD-ROM
herstellen; der Zugang zum Internet ist nicht teurer als ein
Zeitschriftenabonnement, aber sehr viel interessanter, weil man nicht
nur passiver Rezipient ist.

Es geht nicht mehr um den Einfluss, den Bild, Verarbeitungstechnologie
und Computer auf Lesegewohnheiten oder den die neuen Medien auf die
Schreibfaehigkeit ausueben.  Die skizzierte Entwicklung verzeichnet
einen fundamentalen Umbruch--die Abkehr von einem einzigen, alles
beherrschenden Zeichensystem, der Sprache, und von der Schriftkultur
als der verdinglichten Form von Sprache.  An ihre Stelle treten
verschiedene Zeichensysteme, unter denen die visuellen eine fuehrende
Rolle einnehmen.  Wenn wir diesen Umbruch nur als einen verstaerkten
Einfluss der Technologie verstehen, dann verkennen wir die wahre Natur
dieses Umbruchs und der Folgen, die er nach sich zieht; und wir
koennen uns nicht angemessen darauf einstellen.  Wir muessen vor allem
den Grad der Notwendigkeit dieser Technologie erkennen.  Die die
Pragmatik der Industriegesellschaft kennzeichnende Obsession mit
Symptomen ist nicht beschraenkt auf Reparaturwerkstaetten und
Arztpraxen.

Die neuen durch die veraenderte Skala des Menschen eroeffneten
praktischen Erfahrungen, die die Alternativen zur Sprache notwendig
gemacht haben, bestaetigen uns, dass wir uns nicht einfach nur
intensiver mit Fernsehen oder Computerbildschirmen, mit Werbung,
Photographie oder Laserdisketten, CD-ROM, digitalem Fernsehen, dem
Internet oder dem World Wide Web beschaeftigen sollten; worum es
wirklich geht, ist die Frage, wie wir lernen koennen, mit der neuen
Komplexitaet umzugehen, wie wir sie in den Griff bekommen, um unsere
Beduerfnisse und auf Globalitaet gerichteten Erwartungen effizienter zu
erfuellen.

Wer den Niedergang der Schriftkultur auf das Fernsehen oder auf das
Eindringen von elektronischen und digitalen Geraeten in unser Leben
zurueckfuehrt, macht es sich entschieden zu leicht.  Es ist natuerlich
einfacher, die Stunden zu zaehlen, die ein Kind durchschnittlich vor
dem Fernsehgeraet verbringt--in den USA sind es bis zum Schulabschluss
16000 Stunden im Vergleich zu den 13000 Stunden, die fuer das Lesen
aufgebracht werden--, als nach den Gruenden dafuer zu fragen.  Wir
wissen alle, dass ein Kind in Amerika heute, bevor es je Alkohol oder
Zigaretten kaufen darf, ueber eine Million Werbesendungen dazu gesehen
hat.  Dennoch kommt kaum jemand auf den Gedanken, die neuen Arbeits-
und Kommunikationsstrukturen wahrzunehmen, egal wie oberflaechlich
einige davon auch immer sein moegen.  Es ist noch relativ leicht
einzusehen, dass bestimmte Arbeits- und Lebensgewohnheiten verloren
gegangen sind.  Die Gruende hierfuer erschliessen sich uns erst, wenn
wir uns den notwendigen Entwicklungen gegenueber offen zeigen und sie
aus einer gaenzlich neuen Perspektive betrachten.

Einige der heute gelaeufigen visuellen Zeichensysteme haben sich aus
der Schriftkultur heraus entwickelt: Werbung, Theater und
Fernsehspiel.  An sie stellen wir die fuer das Maschinenzeitalter
charakteristischen Erwartungen.  Andere visuelle Zeichensysteme
ueberschreiten die der Schriftkultur gesetzten Grenzen: konkrete
Poesie, Happening, Animation, Performancespiele bis hin zum
interaktiven Videospiel, interaktive Multimedien, virtuelle
Realitaeten und die globalen Netzwerke.  In diesen Aktivitaeten liegt
eine eigene, ganz neue Dynamik, an Stelle der traditionellen
Homogenitaet werden das Anderssein, Unterschiede und Auswahl betont.
Viele dieser Erfahrungen ergeben sich aus der praktischen
Notwendigkeit, den menschlichen Erfahrungshorizont zu erweitern und
mit der Dynamik der globalen Wirtschaft Schritt zu halten.


Wie viele Worte in einem Blick?

In einer Zeitschrift der Druckindustrie (Printer’s Ink) hat Fred R.
Barnard 1921 eine Formulierung verwendet, die seitdem immer wieder
aufgegriffen wurde: "Ein einziger Blick ist 1000 Worte wert!"  Er
formulierte sie spaeter um und behauptete, es sei ein altes
chinesisches Sprichwort: "Ein Bild ist 1000 Worte wert."  Er wollte
damit auf die Wirkungskraft von Bildern aufmerksam machen, auf die im
uebrigen Gestalter und Handwerker aller Art in jahrtausendealter
Praxis schon immer gesetzt hatten.

Bilder sind konkreter als Woerter.  In ihrer Konkretheit vermoegen sie
natuerlich nicht, andere Bilder zu beschreiben.  Dennoch assoziieren
wir mit den abstrakten Begriffen, die der Mensch im Verlauf seiner
praktischen und theoretischen Taetigkeit entwickelt hat, immer wieder
Bilder.  Sie sind auch in ihrer Verwendbarkeit eingeschraenkter und
viel staerker durch ihren Entstehungszusammenhang bestimmt.  Das Wort
rot ist im Vergleich zur Farbe, die es bezeichnet, willkuerlich.  Auch
hat die Bezeichnung selbst nur einen Annaeherungswert.  In einem
bestimmten experimentellen Zusammenhang kann man viele
Farbnuancierungen unterscheiden, fuer die es keine eigenen
Bezeichnungen gibt.  Die Farbe in einem gegebenen Bild hingegen ist
eine messbare physikalische Groesse, die man in der Photographie, im
Druck oder der Pigmentsynthese entsprechend leicht verarbeiten kann.
Im gleichen experimentellen Zusammenhang kann diese Farbe mit vielen
Gegenstaenden und Ablaeufen assoziiert werden: mit Blumen, Blut, einem
Stop-Schild, einem Sonnenuntergang oder einer Fahne.  Sie kann
Vergleiche oder Assoziationen bewirken oder selbst zur
konventionalisierten Bedeutung werden.  Wird ein visuelles Zeichen in
Sprache uebersetzt, wird es mit derartigen fuer die Sprache typischen
Konventionen beladen--Rot als Farbe der Revolution, das Rot der
Kardinaele, der Rotgardisten usw.--und damit aus dem Bereich der
physikalischen Bestimmtheit (Wellenlaenge oder Oszillationsfrequenz)
in den Bereich kultureller Konventionen verlagert.  Diese
Konventionen gehoeren zum Symbolinventar einer bestimmten Gemeinschaft.

Rein bildliche Zeichen wie im Chinesischen und im Japanischen
beziehen sich auf die Sprachstruktur und tragen kulturelle Bedeutung.
Unabhaengig davon, zu welchen Abstraktheits- und Kompliziertheitsgrad
sie sich entwickelt haben, behalten sie doch einen Bezug zu dem, was
sie bezeichnen.  Sie weiten die Erfahrung des Schreibens--besonders
in kalligraphischen UEbungen--auf die darin ausgedrueckte Erfahrung aus.
Wir koennen die in der Sprache verkoerperte Logik durchaus auf Bilder
uebertragen, und das nicht nur bei den chinesischen Ideogrammen.  Doch
veraendern wir damit automatisch den Status des Bildes; es wird eine
Illustration.

Die in der Schriftkultur verkoerperte Sprache ist ein analytisches
Instrument, das die analytische Taetigkeit des Menschen foerdert.
Bilder haben vornehmlich synthetische Eigenschaften und eignen sich
besonders fuer Komposita.  Synthetisierende Taetigkeiten, besonders der
Entwurf von Gegenstaenden, Mitteilungen oder Handlungsablaeufen,
greifen auf Bilder zurueck, besonders auf aussagekraeftige Diagramme
und Zeichnungen.  Schrift beschreibt, Bilder bilden heraus.  Sprache
setzt fuer das Verstehen einen Kontext voraus, in dem
Distributionsklassen definiert werden.  Bilder deuten einen solchen
Kontext an.  Ein Bild kennt aufgrund seines individuellen Charakters
keine Entsprechung fuer eine Distributionsklasse.

Beim Betrachten eines Bildes, zu welchem praktischen oder
theoretischen Zweck auch immer, beziehen wir uns stets auf die
Methode des Bildes, nicht auf seine Bestandteile.  Die Methode eines
Bildes ist seine Erfahrung, nicht eine auf ein bestimmtes Repertoire
angewandte Grammatik oder die Umsetzung bestimmter grammatikalischer
Regeln.  Die Kraft der Sprache liegt in ihrer abstrakten Natur.
Bilder beziehen ihre Wirkungskraft gerade aus ihrer Konkretheit.  Die
Abstraktheit der Sprache ergibt sich daraus, dass eine
Sprachgemeinschaft ein bestimmtes Vokabular und eine Grammatik
gemeinsam hat; die Abstraktheit von Bildern bedeutet, dass Menschen
eine gemeinsame visuelle Erfahrung teilen oder dass die Bilder einen
Kontext fuer neue Erfahrungen schaffen.

Solange die visuelle Erfahrung wie bei den nomadischen Staemmen auf
die eigene, begrenzte Welt beschraenkt blieb, konnten visuelle Zeichen
nicht als Medium fuer eine Erfahrung dienen, die ueber diese sich
veraendernde Welt hinaus wies.  Die Sprache entwickelte sich ja gerade
aus dem Beduerfnis heraus, diese Grenzen von Raum und Zeit zu
ueberwinden und Optionen zu schaffen.  Das abstrakte phonetische
Zeichen bot sich als Alternative, es konnte leichter von einer Welt
in die andere ueberfuehrt werden, wie es die Phoenizier ja auch
praktizierten.  Jedes Alphabet ist ein kondensiertes visuelles
Zeugnis von Erfahrungen, die sich inzwischen von der Sprache und
deren konkreter praktischer Motivierung losgeloest haben.

Schrift visualisiert Sprache; die Lektuere gibt der geschriebenen
Sprache ihre muendliche Dimension zurueck, wenn auch in gezaehmter Form.
Die Buchstaben der verschiedenen Alphabete sind nicht einfache,
neutrale Zeichen fuer eine abstrakte phonetische Sprache, sondern
vielmehr die Zusammenfassung visueller Erfahrungen und die Kodierung
von Regeln des Wiedererkennens; sie haben einen Bezug zu
anthropologischer Erfahrung und zu kognitiven Abstrahierungsprozessen.
Der Mystizismus von Zahlen und deren meta-physische Bedeutung, der
Mystizismus von Buchstaben oder Buchstaben- und Zahlenverknuepfungen,
von Formen, Symmetrien und AEhnlichem gehoeren dazu.  Mit der
Alphabetisierung und der Einfuehrung von Zahlensystemen nahm die
abstrakte Natur der visuellen Darstellung die phonetische Eigenschaft
der Sprache an.  Fuer den durchschnittlich gebildeten (oder
ungebildeten) Menschen ging die Konkretheit der bildlichen
Darstellung zusammen mit den darin gefassten Elementen (welche
Erfahrung steht hinter einem Buchstaben, einer Zahl, einer bestimmten
Schreibweise?) ein fuer allemal verloren.  Eben diese Durchbrechung
von Spracherfahrungen gehoert zum allgemeineren Prozess der
Akkulturierung.  Schriftforscher haben verschiedene Ebenen
nachgewiesen, auf denen ein jedes Buchstabenbild Ausdrucksebenen
formt, die in sich bedeutsam sind.  Dennoch ist deren alphabetisches
Wissen fuer das Schreiben etwa so relevant wie eine gute Beschreibung
der verschiedensten Radtypen fuer die Herstellung und Benutzung von
Automobilen.

Heute verwenden wir Bilder nach Massgabe der Moeglichkeiten, die die
Zwaenge unserer Lebenspraxis und entsprechender Technologien
bereitstellen.  In den vorausgegangenen Kapiteln haben wir einige
dieser Bedingungen ausgefuehrt.  Es waren im einzelnen:
1. die globale Skala unseres Daseins und unserer Taetigkeit;
2. die Vielfalt, die durch die aus der Globalitaet hervorgehenden
praktischen Erfahrungen ermoeglicht wird;
3. die Dynamik immer schneller werdender und zunehmend vermittelter
Formen der Interaktion;
4. die Notwendigkeit, menschliche Interaktion zu optimieren, um
hoehere Effizienzebenen zu erreichen;
5. die Notwendigkeit, die latenten Stereotypien der Sprache zu
ueberwinden;
6. die nicht-lineare, nicht-sequentielle, offene Natur menschlicher
Erfahrungen, die die neue Skala in den Vordergrund gerueckt hat.
Die Aufzaehlung laesst sich fortsetzen.  Je besser wir den Einsatz von
Bildern beherrschen, desto mehr Argumente koennen wir zu ihren Gunsten
vorbringen.  Wir sollten diese Argumente jedoch nicht als unkritische
Verherrlichung von Bildern missverstehen.  Vieles laesst sich nicht
allein durch Bilder ausdruecken: theoretische Arbeit etwa oder
metasprachliche Reflexion.  Bilder sind faktisch, situationsgebunden,
instabil.  Sie vermitteln auch ein falsches Demokratieverstaendnis.
Vor allem aber veranschaulichen sie die Verlagerung von einem
positivistischen Tatsachenverstaendnis, wie es den schriftkulturellen
Determinismus bestimmt, zu einer relativistischen Auffassung von
einer chaotischen Funktionsweise, wie sie sich im Markt oder in den
neuen Formen menschlicher Interaktion niederschlaegt.  Wir muessen ein
besseres Verstaendnis vom Leistungspotential von Bildern ausserhalb
ihrer traditionellen Wirkungsbereiche in Kunst, Architektur und
Design entwickeln, um wirklich ermessen zu koennen, in welchem Masse
sie am Denken und den bislang eher nicht-bildlichen Formen
menschlicher Praxis teilhaben werden.

Die Bildlogik unterscheidet sich von der Logik, die der menschlichen
Selbstkonstituierung durch Sprache zu eigen ist.  Insofern ist sie
besonders in solchen Taetigkeitsbereichen wirkmaechtig, die unsere
Gefuehle und Instinkte einbinden.  Bildlichkeit ist proteischer Natur.
Bilder bilden nicht nur ab; sie formen, gestalten, bilden
Gegenstaende.  Daher koennen Assoziationsablaeufe besser durch Bilder
als durch Sprache unterstuetzt werden.  Durch Bilder wird der Mensch
besser akkulturiert; d. h. in eine Kultur eingebunden und mit einer
Identitaet versehen, die er auf der abstrakten Ebene der
Kultureinbindung durch Sprache nicht erfahren kann.  Die Welt der
Avataren, d. h. die dynamische graphische Darstellung eines Menschen
in der virtuellen Welt der Netzwerke, ist eine konkrete Welt.  Die
hierin einbezogenen Individuen schaffen sich im besten Sinne des
Wortes neu als visuelle Einheiten, die mit anderen einen Dialog
aufnehmen.

Innerhalb einer bestimmten Kultur sind die Bilder aufeinander bezogen.
Innerhalb der Vielfalt der Kulturen koennen Bilder Erfahrungen
uebersetzen.  Vor dem Hintergrund unserer allgemeinen Globalitaet ist
der Bildgebrauch zugleich distinktiv und integrativ.  Die
Distinktionsleistung aeussert sich darin, dass sie die
Identifikationsmerkmale der jeweils kulturgebundenen Individuen traegt,
die sich in den neuen lebenspraktischen Zusammenhaengen konstituieren.
Die Integrationsleistung wird am besten durch die Metapher des
global village veranschaulicht, jener kleinen grossen Welt aus
Telekommunikation und den Interaktionen im Internet und im World Wide
Web.

Wir sollten die bislang eroerterten Eigenschaften von Bildern nunmehr
in Beziehung zu jenen veraenderten Perspektiven setzen, die die
Bildtechnologien eroeffnet haben.  Nur so werden wir verstehen,
inwiefern Bilder Sprachen hervorbringen koennen, die unsere
traditionelle Schriftkultur ueberfluessig machen oder, besser noch, die
sie ergaenzende partielle Alphabetismen erfordern.


Das mechanische und das elektronische Auge

Der Photoapparat und die dazugehoerige Technologie der
Photoentwicklung und -verarbeitung sind Produkte der Schriftkultur,
antizipieren aber einen Zustand jenseits derselben.  Die Metapher des
Auges fuer die Optik der Linse und die Mechanik des Apparats musste fuer
den neuen Blick auf die Wirklichkeit auf Kategorien der Schriftkultur
zurueckgreifen, insbesondere auf deren implizite Raumauffassung und
Raumdarstellung.  Die genaue Diskussion um Moeglichkeiten und Grenzen
der Photographie, die mit den ersten Photos einsetzte und bis in
unsere heutige Zeit anhaelt, ist eine einzige UEbung im analytischen
Denken und Handeln.

Manche haben die Photographie als ein Beschreiben mit Licht
verstanden, andere als mechanisches Zeichnen.  Die kreativen
Moeglichkeiten schienen eher begrenzt, die dokumentarischen standen
ausser Frage: Sie bot eine Art Kurzschrift fuer Beschreibungen, die in
schriftlicher Form schwierig, aber prinzipiell moeglich waren.  Je
mehr die Moeglichkeiten und Verwendungsbereiche der Kamera erweitert
wurden, desto interessanter wurde die Photographie als Beleg und
Dokument in Journalismus und Wissenschaft, im persoenlichen und
familiaeren Leben.  Allmaehlich traten Bilder an die Stelle von Woertern,
und schliesslich mussten Schrift und Schriftkultur eine ganze Reihe
von Erfahrungsbereichen, die mit Raum, Bewegung und ohne Kamera nicht
erkennbaren Aspekten zu tun hatten, der Bildlichkeit als
Darstellungsmedium ueberlassen.

Das Unsichtbare wurde ploetzlich mit Hilfe der Kamera viel
ueberzeugender, anschaulicher und authentischer vorgefuehrt, als Worte
darueber haetten berichten koennen.  Das in vielen Geschichten erwaehnte,
aber im wahren Wortsinn unsichtbare Abwassersystem von Paris mag hier
als Beispiel dienen.  Vor der Photographie konnte nur die Zeichnung
das Sichtbare ohne Umsetzung in Worte oder komplizierte Diagramme
wiedergeben.  Aber jede Zeichnung war schon immer interpretierte
Darstellung, nicht nur dadurch, dass sie auswaehlte, sondern eine
Perspektive waehlen musste und das Dargestellte emotional anreicherte.
Es brauchte lange, bis auch die Kamera eine derartige
interpretierende Eigenschaft aufzuweisen hatte, und auch dann war es
wegen der zwischengeschalteten Verarbeitungstechnologie nicht leicht
zu sagen, was dem abgebildeten Gegenstand hinzugefuegt worden und aus
welchen Gruenden dies geschehen war.

Heutzutage haben alle Photoapparate das notwendige Bedienungswissen
eingebaut.  Die Metapher des Auges, die sich ohnehin mit dem
Aufkommen der elektronischen Photographie veraendert hat, hat sich
ebenso eruebrigt wie jedwede Beachtung von Blende, Belichtungszeit und
Entfernung.  Die Lebenspraxis, die zur Photographie hinfuehrte, hat
mit der heutigen Praxis der vollautomatischen Kamera nur noch wenig
gemein.  Das alltaegliche Photographieren setzt keinerlei spezielle
Kenntnisse mehr voraus, sondern begleitet Reisen, gesellige
Veranstaltungen oder auch sehr persoenliche Situationen gewissermassen
als Alltagsreflex.  So ersetzen Photographien heute schriftliche
Berichte, und Photoalben ersetzen Tagebuecher, zumal ein Photoapparat,
so merkwuerdig das klingen mag, leichter zu benutzen und vermutlich
genauer ist als die Sprache.  In gewisser Hinsicht ist er eine
komprimierte Sprache, die uns auf das kommende Zeitalter einer
visuellen Syntax vorbereitet.  Wenn die wissenschaftliche
Photographie nicht zur Verfuegung stuende, muessten wir fuer das, was uns
die Bilder aus dem Weltraum, vom Elektronenmikroskop, aus dem
Erdinneren oder aus den Tiefen des Meeres mitteilen, ungeheure, kaum
verfuegbare sprachliche Mittel aufwenden.  Zur Zeit Leonardo da Vincis
gab es nur die eine Alternative, die der Zeichnung--neben einer
ausgreifenden Phantasie.

Die Photokamera hat--expliziter noch als die Sprache--eine eingebaute
Raumvorstellung.  Sie ist in der Geometrie der Linse angelegt und
drueckt sich in den charakteristischen Merkmalen der Photographie aus:
zweidimensionale Reduktion unserer dreidimensionalen Erfahrungswelt,
die im wesentlichen durch die physikalischen Eigenschaften der Linse,
aber daneben durch Licht, Filmqualitaet, Entwicklungsart, Photopapier
und verwendete Technik beeinflusst wird.  Mit der Differenzierung
unserer raeumlichen Vorstellungen haben wir auch die Objektive
verbessern (Weitwinkel, Zoom) und Funktionen entwickeln koennen, die
unseren visuellen Erfahrungen entsprechen.  Mit der Moeglichkeit, die
Zeit zu kontrollieren, konnten schliesslich auch dynamische Vorgaenge
aufgezeichnet werden.

Eine neue Phase im Verhaeltnis zwischen Schriftkultur und Photographie
wurde durch die Polaroid-Kamera eingeleitet, die die urspruenglichen
zwei Stadien des Photographierens zusammenfasste, das Ergebnis sofort
ausdruckte und--zumindest anfaenglich--auf Reproduzierbarkeit
verzichtete.  Die traditionelle Kameratechnik wies ein Verhaeltnis
zwischen Mensch und Instrument auf, das auch das Verhaeltnis zur
Maschine kennzeichnete: Was kann ich damit machen?  Mit der
Polaroid-Kamera veraenderte sich die Frage: Was kann sie fuer mich
leisten?  Die Akzentverlagerung drueckt ein veraendertes Verhaeltnis zum
Medium aus und befreit die Photographie zugleich aus einigen von der
Schriftkultur auferlegten Beschraenkungen.  Die Frage "Was kann ich
tun?" zielt auf photographisches Wissen, auf die vom Photographen
getroffene Auswahl, also auf Identitaetserfahrung in einem neuen
lebensweltlichen Erfahrungszusammenhang.  "Was kann sie leisten?"
bezieht sich auf die im Geraet eingebauten Faehigkeiten.  Die Werbung
fuer diese Art von Kamera ist vielsagend: "Sie bekommen Ihr Photo,
solange die Erinnerung frisch ist."  Im Gegensatz zur schriftlichen
Aufzeichnung ist das Sofortbild nur auf kurze Dauer angelegt, als ein
Schnellersatz fuer die Schrift.

Eine noch wichtigere Veraenderung bringt die elektronische und
besonders die digitale Kamera.  In der Digitaltechnik wirkt sich die
geringste Veraenderung des Input nachhaltig auf das Ergebnis aus, und
die Qualitaet ist deutlich besser.  Der Unterschied ist sehr wichtig:
Er kennzeichnet voellig neue Bildbedingungen und veraendert unser
Verhaeltnis zum Visuellen nachhaltig.  Die Sprache fand in der Schrift
das angemessene Medium, die Drucktechnik machte das geschriebene Wort
zum Gegenstand der Schriftkultur.  Bilder konnten nicht mit derselben
Leichtigkeit angefertigt und auch nicht mit den Mitteln uebertragen
werden, die fuer die UEbertragung der Stimme zur Verfuegung standen.
Als wir elektromagnetische Wellen--mit einer Geschwindigkeit mehrfach
so hoch wie die Klanggeschwindigkeit--zur Telefon- oder
Radiouebertragung nutzten, haben wir damit die Funktion der Sprache
gefestigt, sie aber gleichzeitig von einigen Beschraenkungen der
Schriftlichkeit befreit.  Die digitale Photographie leistet ein
Gleiches fuer Bilder.

Die Herstellung eines schriftlichen Berichts ueber einen Vorgang
irgendwo in der Welt erfordert sehr viel mehr Zeit als die
Anfertigung eines Bildes von eben diesem Vorgang.  Ein
Photojournalist kann die Bilder, die er mit seiner digitalen Kamera
aufgenommen hat, per Netzwerk auf die druckfertige Seite senden.  Das
Verstehen eines Bildes, dessen Drucklegung uebrigens schon lange vor
der Erfindung des Computers eine digitale Komponente benoetigte (das
Raster), erfordert einen weitaus geringeren sozialen Aufwand als die
Schriftlichkeit.  Die Komplexitaet verlagert sich von der Aufnahme des
Bildes zu dessen UEbermittlung und Empfang.  In den entsprechenden
neuen Photogeschaeften kann jeder farbenpraechtige Drucke oder die
glaenzenden CDROMs bekommen, von denen jedes einzelne Bild auf den
Fernsehmonitor geholt oder auf unseren Computern weiterverarbeitet
werden kann.

Zwischen der Verwendung des Bildes als Zeugenbeleg und seiner
Verwendung als Praetext fuer neue praktische Anwendungen--ein Medium
von visueller Relativitaet und von fragwuerdiger Moral--ist alles nur
Denkbare moeglich.  Bilder koennen in sich schnell entwickelnden
Situationen--Transaktionen, Informationsaustausch, Konflikten--besser
als Worte vermitteln.  Sie sind frei von den Extralasten, die die
Woerter ueblicherweise mit sich tragen, und sind jederzeit und ueberall
auf der Welt in allen Einzelheiten verstaendlich.  Die elektronische
Verarbeitung digitaler Photographien ermoeglicht--soweit
erforderlich--in vielen unvorhersehbaren Zusammenhaengen Vergleiche
oder Manipulationen.  Die Metapher der Einaeugigkeit, die das Wesen
des Photographischen beschreibt, kennzeichnet eine flache,
zweidimensionale Welt.  Das ist die Sichtweise von Zyklopen, die
alles flach sehen.  Diese Metapher ist leider, wenn auch nicht ganz
zufaellig, fuer die Computergraphik uebernommen worden.  Die Bilder auf
einem Computerbildschirm werden mit den Konventionen des monokularen
Sehens zusammengehalten.  Die digitale Photographie hingegen kann mit
dynamischen Eigenschaften ausgestattet und in Netzwerke eingebracht
werden.  Das wirklich Revolutionaere an der digitalen Photographie ist
jedoch die 3D-Kamera, ein technisches Ungeheuer mit zwei (und wenn es
sein muss, auch mehr) Augen.  Sie eroeffnet Erfahrungen in einem
pragmatischen Rahmen, der nicht laenger auf Sequenzen oder auf
reduktionistische Darstellungsstrategien beschraenkt ist.


Wer hat Angst vor der Lokomotive?

Als man die ersten bewegten Bilder einer OEffentlichkeit vorstellte,
brachen die Zuschauer in Geschrei aus und liefen fort, als eine
Lokomotive im Film direkt auf sie zufuhr.  Die Bewegung erhoehte die
realistische Wirkung der Bilder und vermischte im Film die Grenze
zwischen Wirklichkeit und neuen kinematographischen Ausdrucksformen.
In den fruehen Stummfilmen konnte der an die Schriftkultur gebundene
Realismus des Bildes--das als Illustration des Drehbuchs verstanden
wurde--den fehlenden Gespraechston ersetzen.  Schriftkulturelle
Erfahrung und die Moeglichkeit, Bewegung in den Film hineinzuschreiben,
gehoerten eng zusammen.  Weil die Sprache den allgemeinen
Verstehenshintergrund bot, konnten kurze, detailfreudige Szenen auch
ohne Worte verstanden werden.  Die filmische Konvention beruht auf
der gemeinsamen Erfahrung der Teilhabe an einer ausgedehnten weissen
Seite, auf die laufende Bilder projiziert werden.  Humor stand nicht
zuletzt deshalb im Mittelpunkt, weil die mechanische Reproduktion von
Bewegungsablaeufen aufgrund der erst rudimentaeren Filmtechnik und des
fehlenden Tons ein komisches Element beinhaltete.  Spaeter kam Musik
hinzu, dann der Dialog.  Die Synchronisation von Bild und Ton und
farbige Bilder wurden sehnsuechtig erwartet.

Die im wesentlichen visuelle Natur der filmischen Erfahrung erhellt
erneut die Rolle der Sprache als Synchronisationsmittel, waehrend die
Mechanik von Kamera und Projektor die optischen Illusionen
hervorbrachte.  Zugleich zeigte der Film, dass auch andere Ausdrucks-
und Kommunikationsmittel diese Rolle uebernehmen konnten.  Sprache ist
an Koerperbewegung gebunden und hat nicht selten Anteil an den
rhythmischen Mustern dieser Bewegung.  Im vorsprachlichen Stadium des
Menschen haben andere rhythmische Mittel diese
Synchronisationsleistung getragen, und obwohl es keinerlei Beziehung
zwischen der kinematographischen Erfahrung und den
Migrationsbewegungen primitiver Stammeskulturen gibt, sollten wir
doch diese Grundstruktur der Synchronizitaet zur Kenntnis nehmen.  Die
Mittel, mit denen die Synchronizitaet bewerkstelligt wurde,
kennzeichnen die verschiedenen Stadien der menschlichen Evolution:
von den wenigen und einfachen Mitteln frueher autarker Lebensformen
ueber die komplexen, von der Schriftlichkeit beherrschten Mittel, die
die Verschriftlichung von Bewegung erlaubten, bis hin zur
Kinematographie, die eine neue Synchronisationsstrategie einfuehrte.
In mancherlei Hinsicht zeichnet die Entwicklungsgeschichte des Films
die Entwicklung des Konflikts zwischen der Schriftkultur und den auf
Bildern beruhenden Synchronisationsstrategien nach.

Die Zwischenstadien sind allseits bekannt: Musikbegleitung durch
einen Pianisten, aufgezeichnete Musik, in den Film integrierter Ton,
Stereophonie.  Auch die Funktionen sind offensichtlich: Untermalung
der gefilmten Bewegungsrhythmen, Dramatisierung des Geschehens,
Erhoehung der realistischen Wirkung durch Dialog und wirklichen Ton
und schliesslich die Erweiterung der Ausdrucksmittel zur
Hervorbringung neuer Wirklichkeiten.  Einige kinematographische
Konventionen sind Kulturleistungen, die wir vielleicht mit den
Konventionen der ideographischen Schrift vergleichen koennen.  Sie
gehoeren gleichwohl in einen pragmatischen Zusammenhang, der die
Merkmale der Schriftkultur traegt, ergeben sich jedoch aus Taetigkeiten,
die auf hoehere Produktivitaets- und Effizienzebenen zusteuern.  Jeder
Film ist die Grundform zahlloser Kopien, die Millionen von Zuschauern
vorgefuehrt werden, die wiederum fuer den Nachvollzug des Inhalts keine
schriftkulturelle Bildung benoetigen.  Die filmische Erfahrung bezeugt
die vielfaeltigen Komponenten menschlicher Interaktion und eroeffnet
Ausblicke auf Erfahrungen, die nicht mehr auf das Wort gebracht
werden koennen; sie deutet damit die Moeglichkeit an, die Grenzen der
Schriftkultur zu ueberschreiten und sogar die ersten Schichten des
Sichtbaren hinter sich zu lassen--d. h. genauer: das Imaginaere in den
Prozess der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung einzubeziehen.

Einige dieser Veraenderungen haben sich vollzogen, als der
Film--nachdem er die Phase des verfilmten Theaters durchlaufen
hatte--nach seinen ihm eigenen Ausdrucksmitteln zu suchen begann.
Das fuehrte zunaechst zu einer Komprimierung der Sprache--die Zahl der
Woerter wurde verringert, um eine eigene, filmische Ausdrucksweise zu
finden, Literatur wurde zusammengefasst.  Besonders in der
Nachahmungsphase wurden die Grenzen des Mediums deutlich.  Drehbuecher,
die nach literarischen Werken verfasst waren, deren Komplexitaet die
des Films uebertraf, konnten nicht umgesetzt werden.  Auch musste die
Konzentrationsfaehigkeit der ungeuebten Zuschauer in Rechnung gestellt
werden.  Als dann spaeter ganze Romane in den Zeitrahmen von 90 bis
120 Minuten gepresst wurden, war eine neue Phase erreicht, in der die
Mittel der Schrift durch nichtoder paralinguistische Mittel ersetzt
wurden.

Die Generationen, die mit den Anfaengen des Films aufgewachsen sind,
lernten dessen Konventionen, obwohl sie in schriftkulturelle
Zusammenhaenge eingebunden blieben.  Der Film als Medium sui generis
mit ganz eigenen Merkmalen wurde erst in der juengeren Vergangenheit
so erfahren, und zwar im allgemeinen Zusammenhang einer Lebenspraxis,
die sich allmaehlich von den Einschraenkungen schriftkultureller
Bildung befreite.  Das Medium des Films integriert das Audiovisuelle
und die Bewegung.  Mit den Mitteln des Films koennen die komplizierten
Erfahrungen aufgezeichnet und anschliessend einer schnellen, langsamen,
vollstaendigen oder partiellen Analyse unterzogen werden.  Die
Filmerfahrung ist eine Erfahrung des Zusammenhangs von Raum und Zeit.
Aber im Gegensatz zu der in der Sprache zum Ausdruck gebrachten
Raum- und Zeiterfahrung, die von einer schriftkulturell gebildeten
Gemeinschaft allgemein geteilt wird, koennen Raum und Zeit im Film
unterschiedlich ausfallen oder individuell gepraegt sein.  Innerhalb
der filmischen Konventionen koennen wir uns ueber die physikalischen
Grenzen unserer Lebenswelt und unserer sozialen und kulturellen
Bindungen erheben und einen neuen Handlungsrahmen setzen.  Die grosse
Faszination, die die sich abzeichnenden Technologien zur Schaffung
des Unmoeglichen im virtuellen Raum (die durch digitale Synthese
entstehen) auf die Filmstudios Hollywoods ausueben, ist hierfuer ein
gutes, wenn auch fragwuerdiges Beispiel.  Aber auch hier stossen wir an
die Grenzen, die der dem Film zugrundeliegenden Struktur gesetzt sind.
Der Film, der auf dem Hoehepunkt der Schriftkultur entwickelt wurde,
markiert genau die Grenze, die zwischen den praktischen Erfahrungen
verlaeuft, welche der durch die Schriftkultur optimal repraesentierten
Skala des Menschen entsprechen, und der neuen Skala, fuer die sowohl
Film als auch Schriftkultur nur noch begrenzt angemessen sind.  Es
ist sogar fraglich, ob sich der Film als Alternative zu den neuen
Medien behaupten kann; denn auch die Grenzen seiner
Leistungsfaehigkeit zeichnen sich bereits ab.

Die Filmtechnik hat also unsere Spracherfahrung beeinflusst und
zugleich die Grenzen dieser Erfahrung aufgezeigt.  Ein Film ist weder
ein illustrierter Text noch die Transkription eines Schauspiels.  Er
uebertraegt vielmehr eine Welt aus Saetzen und Bedeutungen, die einem
Text zugewiesen sind, in eine komplexere Welt aus
aufeinanderfolgenden Bildern, die eine neue kohaerente Einheit bilden.
In diesem Prozess fungiert die Sprache einmal als Sprache
(Figurenrede), ein andermal als Praetext fuer den visuellen
kinematographischen Text.

Bevor es den Film gab, haben wir uns in der natuerlichen Welt unseres
konkreten, physikalischen Daseins, auf der Buehne des Theaters oder in
der Welt unserer Phantasien und Traeume bewegt.  Die sychronisierende
Funktion der Sprache hat diese Bewegung (Arbeit, Zusammenleben)
sozial relevant gemacht.  Unsere in der Sprache vollzogene Bewegung
(mach das, geh dort hin) ist eine Abstraktion.  Die im Film
aufgezeichnete Bewegung ist indessen eine Re-Konkretisierung dieser
Abstraktion.  Das erklaert, warum Filme so wichtig als Bedienungs- und
Handlungsanleitung, fuer Unterricht und Indoktrination geworden sind.
Das erklaert auch, warum ein Film selten oder nie an ein Individuum
gerichtet ist, sondern an ein Publikum, dessen Groesse seine Produktion
erst wirtschaftlich macht.  Die Filmindustrie in Hollywood beruht auf
einer Effizienzformel, die die Globalitaet des Publikums, den global
verbreiteten Analphabetismus und die vorhandenen
Distributionsmechanismen einkalkuliert.  Fuer einen Film mit einem
Investitionsaufwand von ueber 100 Millionen Dollar benoetigt man die
Zuschauer von fuenf Kontinenten, ohne dass damit schwarze Zahlen
garantiert sind.  Es ist noch nicht absehbar, ob Dreamworks, das aus
der Affaere zwischen Hollywood und der Computerindustrie
hervorgegangen ist, irgendwann seine eigenen Distributionskanaele im
globalen digitalen Netzwerk einrichten wird.

Es draengt sich die Frage auf, ob die Sprache des Films die
Schriftkultur ueberfluessig gemacht oder ob der um sich greifende
Analphabetismus erst das Beduerfnis nach Filmen hervorgerufen hat.
Natuerlich gibt es dafuer keine einfache Erklaerung, und es spielen eine
ganze Reihe von Faktoren zusammen.  Das Schluesselelement ist die
zugrundeliegende Struktur.  Buecher verkoerpern die Eigenschaften der
Sprache und setzen Erfahrungen in Gang, die im Rahmen dieser
Eigenschaften liegen.  Wenn sich der Mensch neuen lebenspraktischen
Beduerfnissen und Herausforderungen ausgesetzt sieht, die sich aus
einer neuen Skala des Daseins ergeben, dann sinnt er nach
Alternativen, die der Dynamik des Umbruchs besser gerecht werden als
Buecher und die damit verbundenen Erfahrungen.

Buecher, in denen selbst hochgebildete Menschen bisweilen den Faden
verlieren oder fuer deren Lektuere wir heute nicht mehr die Zeit oder
die Geduld aufbringen, werden fuer uns im Film interpretiert oder
zusammengefasst.  Dadurch--und nur dadurch--hat mehr als eine
Generation einen allgemeinen Zugang zu etablierten Meisterwerken der
Prosa und des Theaters, zu wissenschaftlichen, historischen oder
geographischen Berichten gefunden.  Das hatte und hat seinen
Preis--zwischen Buch und Film gibt es keine direkte Entsprechung;
aber darum geht es hier nicht.  Es geht darum, dass sich die
Kinematographie in einem Rahmen herausgebildet hat, in dem
Schriftkultur und schriftkulturelle Bildung diejenigen Erfahrungen,
die ausserhalb ihrer Strukturen liegen, nicht mehr zu tragen vermoegen.

Die Ausdrucksmittel des Films konnten bestimmte Aspekte des sozialen
Lebens besser vermitteln, als es die sprachlichen Mittel vermochten.
Auch sind die filmischen Ausdrucksmittel fuer die Dynamik des Umbruchs
und die Globalitaet unseres Lebens besser geeignet.  Sie haben uns auf
die elektronischen Medien vorbereitet und verkuenden das Zeitalter der
Obsession mit Beruehmtheit (Stars).


Hier und dort gleichzeitig

Wenn das Filmische die Grenzlinie zwischen der Schriftkultur und
einer Phase jenseits von ihr markiert, dann verkoerpert das Fernsehen
den Konflikt zwischen einer auf Schriftkultur basierenden
Zivilisation und der Zivilisation der ‘Illiteralitaet’.  Das Fernsehen
hat das Gewicht eindeutig zu Gunsten des Visuellen verlagert.  Es
wurde in genau jenem Zusammenhang erfunden, in dem sich die Skala des
menschlichen Lebens aenderte.  Mit ihm vollzog sich der UEbergang von
einer Welt der Mechanik und der Chemie, die noch die Produktion und
Wiedergabe von Filmen bestimmte, zu einer Welt der Elektronik und der
digitalen Technologie.

Das Fernsehen ergab sich aus den Veraenderungen der Natur und Struktur
unserer theoretischen und praktischen Erfahrungen; es entwickelte
sich aus dem Beduerfnis heraus, dynamische Bilder aufzuzeichnen und zu
uebermitteln.  Elektrizitaet hatte bereits als Medium fuer die
Aufzeichnung und UEbermittlung des Tons in Elektronengeschwindigkeit
durch die Telefonnetzwerke gedient.  Und da Bilder und Geschehnisse
durch das Licht beeinflusst sind, in dem wir sie sehen, ergibt sich
der Wunsch, das Licht aufzuzeichnen und zu uebertragen.  Eben das wird
vom Fernsehen geleistet.  In seinen ungelenken und noch in vielem der
Mechanik verpflichteten Anfaengen war das Fernsehen ein
Nachrichtenmedium, das eine direkte Verbindung zwischen der
Informationsquelle und dem Publikum herstellte.  Es war weitgehend
illustrativ.  Heute ist es konstitutiv, d. h. es uebermittelt nicht
nur Nachrichten, es macht Nachrichten.  Es konstituiert ein allgemein
verbreitetes Massenmedium, in dem sich Unterhaltung und Ritual
(politisches, religioeses, militaerisches) ausbreiten.

Die Schriftkultur ermoeglicht die Erfahrungen menschlicher
Selbstkonstituierung in einer von der klassischen Physik und Chemie
beherrschten und erklaerten Welt.  Sie basiert auf derselben
Grundstruktur und gibt die spezifischen Merkmale dieser Erfahrung
wider.  Elektrizitaet und Elektronik ermoeglichen extrem schnelle
Ablaeufe, eine menschliche Taetigkeit auf hoechster Effizienzebene, hohe
Vielfalt, sehr unterschiedliche Vermittlungselemente und
Feedback-Phaenomene.  Die Filmkamera traegt noch alle Zeichen der
Schriftkultur.  Sie kann durchaus mit der Druckmaschine verglichen
werden, wenn der Vergleich auch nur teilweise zutrifft, denn sie
schreibt Bewegungen auf den Film und laesst sie uns kollektiv auf der
weissen Seite, der Leinwand, lesen.  Zwischen der Aufzeichnung der
Bewegung und der Betrachtung liegt genuegend Zeit, um die Aufzeichnung
zu verarbeiten und zu vervielfaeltigen.

Das Fernsehen ist seiner Struktur nach voellig anders.  Es faengt
Bewegung und all das andere, was wir fuer Wirklichkeit halten, ein und
macht es dem Betrachter direkt zugaenglich.  Elektronische UEbertragung
ist viel elaborierter und vielschichtiger als die Filmtechnik und
daher viel effizienter.  Der Film uebertraegt aus der ausgewaehlten Welt
der Bewegung an ein begrenztes Publikum im Kino.  Das Fernsehen
uebertraegt mit vielen Kameras in die ganze Welt, und alle Menschen
koennen die Fernsehbilder gleichzeitig empfangen.  Fernsehen ist
allgemein verbreitet und simultan, unterschiedliche Ereignisse an
verschiedenen Orten koennen gleichzeitig auf den Fernsehschirm
gebracht werden.  Im Vergleich dazu ist der Film zentralistisch, auf
eine OErtlichkeit beschraenkt, an der er sich abspielt.  Er ist
sequentieller Natur insofern, als er einer Erzaehlstruktur folgt und
eine abgeschlossene Erzaehleinheit ausmacht.  In seiner endgueltigen
Form kann er nicht mehr veraendert und durch neue Elemente ergaenzt
werden.

Film und Fernsehen repraesentieren mithin trotz einiger
Gemeinsamkeiten zwei voellig unterschiedliche und unvereinbare
Taetigkeits- und Erfahrungsbereiche.  Und da das Fernsehen
mittlerweile Eingang in Schul- und Ausbildung, in mancherlei Formen
kollektiver Kommunikation, in Sport, Kunst und sonstige Bereiche wie
Weltraumforschung oder Kriegsfuehrung gefunden hat, koennen wir wohl
sagen, dass es erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die heutigen sozialen
Interaktionsformen besitzt, ohne selbst ein interaktives Medium zu
sein.  Die Fernsehuebertragung eines wichtigen Ereignisses erreicht
nahezu die gesamte Weltbevoelkerung.  In seinen Anfaengen foerderte das
Fernsehen solche Eindruekke von Dezentralisierung, die die
vorausgegangenen Technologien nicht vermitteln konnten.  Videokamera
und Videorecorder, besonders die digitalen Ausfuehrungen, machen uns
nunmehr zu Besitzern nicht nur der Empfangsgeraete fuer die neue Bild-
und Tonsprache, sondern auch der Sender, der Quellen, machen uns alle
zu Inhabern kleiner Hollywood-Filmstudios, veranlassen uns die
Sprache des Fernsehens zu leben, sie an die Stelle der Schriftkultur
zu setzen.  Das interaktive Fernsehen wird diesen Prozess noch weiter
unterstuetzen.

Schon heute schicken viele Menschen anstelle von Briefen Videobaender
an Verwandte, Behoerden oder an Fernsehsender, die an einem Feedback
oder an neuem Stoff interessiert sind.  Der massive Truppenaufmarsch
im Golfkrieg hat verdeutlicht, welch grosse Rolle die
Videokommunikation bei der Verlagerung von schriftkultureller zu
schriftloser Kommunikation spielt.  Telefon-, Fernsehund Videotechnik
beherrschten die Kommunikationsmuster aller Beteiligten.  Spaetere
Truppenbewegungen (in Somalia, Bosnien-Herzegowina) haben dieses
Muster der schriftlosen, ‘illiteralen’ Kommunikation bekraeftigt.

Unter den vielen Netzwerken, die heute unsere Existenzgrundlagen
staendig veraendern, spielt das Kabelfernsehen eine besondere Rolle.
Fuer viele ist das Kabelfernsehen lediglich eine Ersatzbibliothek,
eine weitere Moeglichkeit, klassische Programme, Pornographie und
Aberglauben in unseren Privatbereich hineinzutragen.  Die
erschoepfende Nutzung unserer elektronischen Prachtstrasse als eine
vielspurige Autobahn, die von uns in beiden Richtungen benutzt werden
kann, als Empfaenger all dessen, was wir empfangen wollen, und als
Sender von visuellen Nachrichten an jeden, der sie empfangen moechte,
liegt noch vor uns.  Aber mit der computergestuetzten visuellen
Kommunikation unter Einbeziehung des digitalen Fernsehens verfuegen
wir ueber die komplette Infrastruktur fuer eine visuell bestimmte
Gesellschaft.  Im Zeitalter des Internet gehoeren die verkabelten oder
drahtlosen Netzwerke zum kuenstlichen Nervensystem fortschrittlicher
Gesellschaften.  Ob mit Hilfe von Modems oder anderen
hochentwickelten Methoden digitaler Informationsverarbeitung, das
Kabelsystem hat schon heute das Wesen vieler unserer Erfahrungen
veraendert, vor allem im Bereich der Unterhaltung, des Unterrichts und
der Arbeitswelt.

Das hat auch negative Auswirkungen, und wir muessen uns mit den Folgen
auseinandersetzen, die mit der Zeit weit ueber das hinausgehen koennen,
was wir heute wissen.  Kindern, die vor dem Fernsehgeraet aufwachsen,
fehlt die Erfahrung der eigenen Bewegung.  Unter dem Begriff der
"kindlichen Zombie-Natur" hat Jaron Lanier auf ein verbreitetes
Phaenomen hingewiesen: ein leerer, nichtssagender Blick; die mangelnde
Faehigkeit, ueber das Fernsehbild hinaus anderes zu sehen und zu
begreifen; die Forderung nach sofortiger Befriedigung der Wuensche;
mangelnde Wertschaetzung fuer erfolgreiche und befriedigende Arbeit.
Viele Videospiele erziehen unseren Kindern die Verhaltensmuster von
Versuchsratten an, die lernen, Probleme durch mechanische Routine zu
loesen.  Die Massstaebe fernsehgerecht aufbereiteter Wettkaempfe sind nur
ein magerer Ersatz fuer Leistung und Verantwortung.  Und wenn sie zu
waehlen haben, dann zwischen Markennamen, ganz gleich, ob damit
politische Programme oder Konsumgueter bezeichnet werden.  Als Masse
angesprochen verleiben sie sich mit den fuer alles und jedes
erstellten Meinungsumfragen die Mehrheitsmeinungen ein.  Dass diese
Technologie visuelle Alternativen zur Schriftlichkeit der
Schriftkultur anbietet, steht ausser Frage.  Die Crux liegt darin, in
welchem Masse diese Alternativen die ehemaligen Formen der
Determiniertheit und die frueheren Zwaenge perpetuieren oder ob sie
einem neuen Entwicklungsstadium des Menschen Ausdruck verleihen.  Der
Grad der Notwendigkeit und damit die Effizienz einer jeglichen neuen
visuellen Ausdrucks-, Kommunikations- und Interaktionsform ist
dadurch bestimmt, wie sich die Menschen durch ihr praktisches Handeln
unter Einbezug des Visuellen in der Welt konstituieren.  Der hoechste
gueltige Massstab ist der der Verwirklichung unserer individuellen
Moeglichkeiten.  Ein Staatspraesident oder ein Fernsehstar, telegen
oder nicht, hat wenig oder gar keinen Einfluss auf unsere individuelle
Verwirklichung in der vernetzten Welt.

Obwohl das Fernsehen viel mit Sprache zu tun hat, benoetigen wir fuer
den Konsum einer Fernsehshow keine schriftkulturelle Bildung.  Daher
beguenstigt anhaltender Fernsehkonsum stereotypes Sprechen und Denken,
das sich vor dem Hintergrund allgemein verbreiteter Ausdrucksformen,
Gesten und Werte vollzieht.  Es waere indes zu einfach, hierbei nur
das Negative herauszustellen: die Foerderung von Passivitaet und
geistiger Lethargie etwa, die Manipulierbarkeit (in wirtschaftlicher,
politischer und religioeser Hinsicht) oder die Losloesung von
erfuellenden persoenlichen Beziehungen (zu anderen, zur Kunst oder zur
Literatur).  Diese und zahlreiche weitere Faktoren, die uns
Medienkritiker und Soziologen immer wieder vorhalten, sollten in der
Tat nicht unterschaetzt werden.  Aber es waere anmassend, das Fernsehen
uneinsichtig und geradezu kurzsichtig nur aus dem Blickwinkel
verlorengehender Schriftkultur zu betrachten.  Wir sollten auch und
vor allem die Strukturveraenderungen begreifen, die zu Fernsehen und
Video gefuehrt haben, und diejenigen Veraenderungen genauer untersuchen,
die diese ihrerseits bewirkt haben.  Anders koennen wir die neuen
Moeglichkeiten, die uns diese neuen Erfahrungen eroeffnen, nicht
nutzbringend anwenden.  Ausser dem Fernsehen gibt es noch so viel mehr,
trotz der uns versprochenen 500 Kanaele und des fast unbegrenzten
Angebots an Videokassetten.

Auch die Sprache ist nicht unbedingt ein demokratisches Medium, und
die Schriftkultur mit den ihr eigenen elitaeren Merkmalen noch weniger.
Wenngleich sie die demokratischen Prinzipien verkuendigte und
festigte, hat gerade sie diese doch immer wieder verraten.  Bilder
verlangen uns zwar weniger ab, sind dafuer aber allgemeiner und
leichter zugaenglich.  Woerter und Texte koennen die Bedeutung einer
Aussage verdunkeln, Bildern koennen unmittelbar zu dem in Beziehung
gesetzt werden, was sie bezeichnen.  Im Visuellen sind mehr Sperren
eingebaut als im Wort, obwohl die verleitende Kraft eines Bildes
vermutlich mehr missbraucht werden kann als die des Wortes.  All das
wird uns helfen, die Verlagerung sozialer und politischer Funktionen
von der Schriftkultur (Buecher und Zeitungen, politische Manifeste,
Zeremonien und Rituale, die auf Text und Lesen basieren) auf visuelle
Medien, besonders das Fernsehen und dessen Folgen besser zu verstehen.
Wir sollten dabei auch bedenken, dass nicht das Fernsehen daran
schuld ist, wenn viele in unserer heutigen Zeit jenseits der
Schriftkultur von ihrem Wahlrecht keinen Gebrauch machen, und dass es
nicht das visuelle Element ist, das Schauspieler, Rechtsanwaelte,
Erdnussfarmer oder erfolgreiche Manager aus der OElindustrie in die
hoechsten politischen (und am wenigsten nuetzlichen) Regierungsaemter
bringt.

Das HDTV (hochaufloesbares Fernsehen) zeigt uns einige der typischen
Merkmale dieser Entwicklung--vor allem, wie die Integrationsfunktion
ausgeuebt wird.  Integration durch Schriftkultur erforderte
gemeinsames Wissen, vor allem gemeinsame Schreib- und Lesekenntnisse.
Integration ueber die Vermittlung der modernen bildherstellenden
Technologien, besonders ueber Fernsehen und computergestuetzte visuelle
Kommunikation, bedeutet Zugang zu und Verfuegbarkeit von Informationen.
Das Fernsehen laesst Laender mit unterschiedlichster Identitaet,
Geschichte und Kultur nach aussen hin so gleich aussehen, dass man sich
nach den Gruenden fuer die Uniformitaet fragen muss.  Alle Erklaerungen im
Detail--Marktprozesse, vor allem weltweit greifende Werbung, das
uniforme elektronische Auge--vermoegen letztendlich nicht zu
ueberzeugen.  Die AEhnlichkeit ist vielmehr bestimmt durch den
Mechanismus, den wir zur Erreichung hoeherer Effizienz einsetzen:
durch zunehmende Arbeitsteilung, erhoehte Vermittlung und den Bedarf
an alternativen Integrationsmechanismen--all das spiegelt sich in den
Fernsehbildern wider.  Diese AEhnlichkeit bildet das Substrat der
Fernsehbilder und das Substrat des Modetrends, der neuen Rituale und
neuen Werte, so kurzlebig sie auch sein moegen.

Schriftkultur und Fernsehen schliessen einander nicht aus.  Aber
diejenigen, die die Qualitaet der schriftkulturellen Bildung durch
Fernsehen erhoehen zu koennen glaubten, mussten einsehen, dass diese
Mittel nicht zum erwuenschten Ziel gefuehrt haben.  Sprache
stabilisiert, macht gleichfoermig, entpersonalisiert.  Fernsehen haelt
Schritt mit allen Veraenderungen, ist offen fuer Vielfalt und erlaubt
persoenliche Interaktion zwischen jenen, die durch Kameras und
Empfaenger miteinander verbunden sind.  Schrift und Schriftkultur sind
hochentwickelt, kompliziert, anspruchsvoll und traege.  Fernsehen ist
spontan und augenblicksbezogen.  Daneben leistet es wissenschaftliche
Dienste, fuer die sich die Sprache nicht eignet.  Wir koennen mit der
Sprache keine Dinge erfassen, die wir uns nicht vorstellen koennen.
Wir koennen in der Sprache keine Ablaeufe erfassen, die wir auf einem
Fernsehschirm modellhaft darstellen und mit denen wir zukuenftiges
Handeln entwerfen koennen.  Natuerlich verwische ich mit solchen
UEberlegungen die Grenzen zwischen dem konventionellen Fernsehen und
dem digitalen Bild.  Entscheidend ist aber, dass das Fernsehen mit
allen seinen Moeglichkeiten und Anwendungen den naechsten Schritt zu
einer Sprache der Bilder vollzieht, die die Moeglichkeiten der
Computertechnologie und der Vernetzung bewusst miteinbezieht.

Das digitale Fernsehen ist in vielen Bereichen einsetzbar.
Designtaetigkeit jedweder Art (Kleidung, Gestaltung von Moebeln,
Produktdesign) kann sich aus der Zusammenarbeit zahlreicher
Beteiligter an vielen unterschiedlichen Orten entwickeln und
unmittelbar in die Produktion einmuenden.  Modifizierungen und Tests
koennen staendig vorgenommen, Produktionsentscheidungen spontan
getroffen werden.  Kommunikation auf derart hohen Effizienzebenen
wird zum entscheidenden Bestandteil der kreativen und produktiven
Leistung.  Die Sprache ist die Sprache des Produkts, eine sich
fortschreibende visuelle Wirklichkeit.  Die daraus resultierenden
Design- und Produktionszyklen werden kuerzer, viel kuerzer, als dass sie
in einer auf Schriftlichkeit beruhende Kommunikationsform eingebettet
bleiben koennten.

Dieser Effizienzgrad ist nur durch digitale Technik zu erreichen.
Jedes einzelne digitale Bild kann gespeichert, veraendert und in neue
Kontexte eingebracht werden.  Es eroeffnet ungeahnte
Handlungsspielraeume, veranlasst kreatives Programmieren und
Interaktivitaet.  Wer sich diese Moeglichkeiten zur kreativen Planung
offenhaelt, erschliesst sich eine neue Welt.  Es ist durchaus denkbar,
dass sich aus diesen Taetigkeiten voellig neue, ertragreichere Formen
der Kommunikation einstellen.  In etwa zehn Jahren werden alle
Fernsehgeraete auf digitalen Empfang umgeruestet sein, sofern es dann
ueberhaupt noch einzelne Fernsehempfaenger geben wird.  Entscheidend
aber sind die unzaehligen kreativen Moeglichkeiten, die sich aus dieser
neuen Wirklichkeit des digitalen Fernsehens ergeben.


Visualisierung

Um mitzuteilen, dass wir etwas verstanden haben, greifen wir auf
verschiedene Alltagsidiome zurueck.  Im Englischen sagt man "I see.",
im Deutschen "Ich habe begriffen."  In beiden Faellen wird die
abstrakte Sprache gewissermassen rekonkretisiert, auf ein Greifbares
oder Visuelles zurueckgefuehrt.  Wir setzen das Verstandene also
offenbar wieder in Dinge und Bilder um, an denen wir das Abstrakte
festmachen.  Ich wuerde sogar sagen, dass wir alles Abstrakte in der
Konkretheit unserer Sinneseindruecke neu schaffen.  In Sprache und
Schriftkultur herrscht Rationalitaet vor, gebildet zu sein ist fuer
viele gleichbedeutend damit, rational zu sein.  In Wirklichkeit ist
jedoch die Rationalitaet, die wir mit Sprache verbinden, ein kleiner
Teil der potentiellen Rationalitaet des Menschen.  Die Messung
(lateinisch ratio), die wir in unsere Objektivierung
hineinprojizieren, koennte durchaus auch auf unser Wahrnehmungssystem
bezogen sein.  Es spricht manches dafuer, dass einige negative
Auswirkungen unserer schriftkulturellen Rationalitaet haetten vermieden
werden koennen, wenn wir auch unsere anderen
Persoenlichkeitsdimensionen in unser Tun eingebracht haetten.

Wir haben in verschiedenen Zusammenhaengen festgestellt, dass die
Verlagerung von Schriftkultur und Schriftlichkeit zu einer staerker
auf Visualisierung gruendenden Zivilisationsform durch neue Geraete,
verstaerkte Vermittlung und Integrationsmechanismen hervorgerufen
wurde, welche sich ihrerseits aus den neuen Lebenspraktiken einer
veraenderten Skala des menschlichen Tuns entwikkelt haben.  Die
Erweiterung unseres Erkenntnis- und Handlungshorizonts hat komplexere
Arbeitszusammenhaenge hervorgebracht, fuer die unsere Schriftkultur nur
noch bedingt geeignet war und neue, strukturell angemessenere
Sprachen entwickelt werden mussten.  Die Integration dieser Vielfalt
ist durch schriftkulturelle Mittel nur noch teilweise zu leisten,
nicht zuletzt auch deshalb, weil viele Wissenschaftler aller
Disziplinen die besessene Suche nach endgueltigen Erklaerungen
aufgegeben und durch Vorstellungen von unbegrenzten Ablaeufen ersetzt
haben.

Bilder eignen sich neben anderen Zeichensystemen strukturell besser
fuer einen pragmatischen Rahmen, der durch die unaufhoerliche
Vermehrung von Wahloptionen, durch hohe Effizienz und Distribution
gekennzeichnet ist.  Um aber Bilder fuer solche Zwecke einsetzen zu
koennen, benoetigt man einen konzeptuellen Kontext, der diese extensive
Bildverwendung zulaesst.  Keiner von denen, die an der Erfindung des
Computers beteiligt waren, konnte vorhersehen, dass seine Leistung
ueber die Mechanisierung der Zahlenverarbeitung hinausgehen wuerde.
Die visionaere Dimension des digitalen Computers ist nicht in seiner
Technologie angelegt, sondern im Konzept einer Universalsprache,
einer characteristica universalis, oder, wie Leibniz es nannte, einer
lingua Adamica.

Das vorliegende Buch will weder die Geschichte des Computers
schreiben noch die der Sprachen, die vom Computer verarbeitet werden.
Aber unser Thema der Visualisierung--vor allem unter dem
Gesichtspunkt einer Verlagerung von Schriftlichkeit auf
Bildlichkeit--erfordert eine kurze Eroerterung der Frage, wie
Visualisierung und die Benutzung des Computers durch den Menschen
zusammenhaengen.  Das binaere Zahlensystem (das Leibniz in einer auf
den 15. Maerz 1679 datierten Handschrift Arithmetica Binarica nannte)
war urspruenglich nicht als endgueltiges Alphabet aus nur zwei
Buchstaben konzipiert, sondern als Grundlage fuer eine die
Begrenztheit der natuerlichen Sprachen ueberschreitende
Universalsprache.  Bei allen Bemuehungen Leibniz’, diese
Universalsprache fuer Gesetzestexte, wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse,
Musik u. a. nutzbar zu machen, ist doch die eigentliche Leistung
jahrhundertelang unbeachtet geblieben, aehnlich wie der Versuch,
abstrakte Phaenomene mit Hilfe der zwei Symbole seines Alphabets zu
visualisieren.  Dabei verdienen zwei Briefe an Nicolas de Remond (ca.
1714) besondere Beachtung, in denen er komplizierte Begriffe aus der
chinesischen Philosophie in sein binaeres Zeichensystem uebertraegt.
Diese Briefe fuehren uns unmittelbar in den Bereich des Visuellen und
belegen vermutlich erstmalig den Versuch, aus dem Ideographischen ins
Sequentielle und schliesslich ins Digitale zu uebersetzen.  Es mussten
300 Jahre vergehen, bis Computerfreaks bei ihren Versuchen, das
Digitalprinzip fuer Musiknotation zu verwenden, entdeckten, dass Bilder
in einem binaeren System geschrieben werden koennen.

Zwei Schluesse lassen sich daraus ziehen: 1. Nicht die verfuegbare
Technologie hat unseren Blick fuer die Bedeutung von Bildern geschaerft
und den Weg zu ihrer digitalen Verarbeitung geoeffnet, sondern die
geistige Faehigkeit, die durch die eigene Effizienzerwartung motiviert
war. 2. Visualisierung beschraenkt sich nicht auf die Illustration von
Woertern, Begriffen oder Eingebungen.  Sie stellt vielmehr den Versuch
dar, geeignete Instrumente, Bilder, zur Darstellung und Verwendung
von Informationen zu entwickeln.  Ein Text auf dem Computerbildschirm
ist ein solches Bild, die Visualisierung von Sprache, die nicht aus
einer menschlichen Hand mit einem Schreibwerkzeug stammt.  Ein
Computer spricht keine Sprache.  Er uebersetzt jedwedes Alphabet in
sein eigenes Alphabet, verarbeitet es und uebersetzt es zurueck in
unser Alphabet, und zwar in Form gespeicherter oder automatisch
erzeugter Bilder.

Auch beim Schreiben visualisieren wir, indem wir Sprache auf dem
Papier sichtbar werden lassen.  Beim Zeichnen setzen wir unsere Plaene
fuer neue Gegenstaende ins Bild.  Solange wir den Computer lediglich
anstelle anderer Schreibwerkzeuge verwenden, veraendern wir damit
nicht die Bedingungen der Sprache.  Wenn wir aber darueber hinaus
Sprachregeln einprogrammieren (Rechtschreibung, Morphologie u. ae.),
Vokabular und Grammatik speichern und menschliche Sprachverwendung
nachahmen lassen, dann ist das geschriebene Ergebnis nur noch
teilweise auf die Schriftbildung des Verfassers zurueckzufuehren.  Die
Visualisierung des Textes fuehrt zur automatischen Erstellung anderer
Texte und zu Beziehungen zwischen Sprache und nicht-sprachlichen
Zeichensystemen.  Wir verfuegen heute ueber Mittel zur elektronischen
Verknuepfung von Bild und Text, fuer Querverweise zwischen Bild und
Text und fuer die schnelle Umsetzung von Texten in Diagramme.  Es gibt
inzwischen elektronische Zeitschriften, deren Begutachtungs- und
Herausgebertaetigkeiten ausschliesslich im Netzwerk ablaufen.  Sie
koennen Bilder, Animationen und Geraeusche integrieren und
OnlineReaktionen auf Hypothesen und Daten hervorrufen.  Diese
Publikationen erreichen ihr Publikum natuerlich sehr viel schneller.
Damit hat sich das Internet zu einem neuen Publikationsmedium
entwickelt, in dem der Computer die Rolle der Druckmaschine
uebernimmt--einer Druckmaschine mit voellig neuen Eigenschaften.  Damit
haben all diejenigen, die sich in der neuen Welt des Internet
entfalten, Zugang zu Informationsressourcen gefunden, die vordem nur
den Eigentuemern der Druck- und Medienindustrie oder anderen
gesellschaftlich privilegierten Personen offenstand.

Die visuelle Komponente des Computers, die Computergraphik, beruht
auf der gleichen Sprache aus Nullen und Einsen, auf der saemtliche
anderen Computerablaeufe beruhen.  Diese gemeinsame alphabetische und
grammatische Grundlage erlaubt es, Sprache (UEbersetzungen von Bildern
oder Zahlen-Bild-Beziehungen wie Diagramme, Skizzen u. ae.) und
abstrakte Beziehungen zu betrachten.  Die Entwicklung von Mitteln,
mit deren Hilfe wir die Grenzen von Sprache und Schriftlichkeit
ueberwinden koennen, hat die wissenschaftliche Arbeit vergangener Jahre
beherrscht.  Die neuen Mittel der Informationsverarbeitung versetzen
uns nunmehr in die Lage, an die Stelle der ueblichen
phaenomenologischen Beobachtung die Entwicklung und Verwendung
verschiedener Spezialsprachen zu setzen, mittels derer wir neue, auf
sehr komplexe und dynamische Phaenomene bezogene Theorien entwerfen
koennen.

Wir wollen die Verlagerung auf visuelle Darstellungsmodi und die
damit verbundene Verlagerung von quantitativen Evaluationen zu
qualitativen Evaluationen einschliesslich der diese darstellenden
Bildlichkeit an einigen Ablaeufen verdeutlichen.  In der medizinischen
Forschung, bei der Synthese neuer Substanzen und bei der
Weltraumforschung haben sich Woerter nicht nur als irrefuehrend,
sondern auch in mancherlei Hinsicht als ineffektiv erwiesen.  So
haben neue Visualisierungstechniken auf der Grundlage der
Molekularresonanz innovative Bereiche der Medizin weitgehend von der
Sprache losgeloest: Patienten beschreiben ihren Zustand, AErzte
vergleichen diese Beschreibungen mit Krankheitstypologien, die auf
den neuesten und fortlaufend ergaenzten Daten beruhen; im Netzwerk
kann der jeweils qualifizierteste Arzt konsultiert werden;
experimentelle Daten werden mit den theoretischen Modellen
zusammengefuehrt, die Ergebnisse visualisiert und auf digitalen
breitbaendigen Hochgeschwindigkeitskanaelen ausgetauscht.

Mit solchen Visualisierungstechniken haben wir mittlerweile auch
besseren Zugang zu den Daten der Vergangenheit bekommen und natuerlich
zu den Informationen, die wir fuer unsere zukunftsgerichteten Projekte
benoetigen.  Mit der Computertomographie konnte z. B. der innere
Aufbau aegyptischer Mumien dreidimensional dargestellt werden, ohne
dass sie auseinandergenommen und beschaedigt werden mussten.  Dabei
wurde ein Simulationssystem verwendet, wie es in der nicht-intrusiven
Chirurgie ueblich ist.  Bei Design und Herstellung neuer Materialien,
der Weltraumforschung und in der Nanotechnologie ist die analytische
Perspektive schriftlichkeitsbezogener Methoden laengst durch visuelle
Synthetisierungsmethoden ersetzt worden.  Molekuelstrukturen koennen
abgebildet und Interaktionsprozesse von Molekuelen simuliert werden,
um die Einwirkung von Medikamenten auf die behandelten Zellen, die
Dynamik der Vermischung sowie chemische und biochemische Reaktionen
verfolgen zu koennen.  Es ist ferner moeglich, in virtuellen Raeumen
jene Kraefte zu simulieren, die beim sogenannten Docking
(Zusammenfuegen) von Molekuelen eine Rolle spielen.  Keine sprachliche
Beschreibung, keine Flugsimulation kann die Abbildung von Daten aus
der Radioastronomie oder wesentliche Bereiche der Genetik und
modernen Physik ersetzen.  Nicht zuletzt ergibt der Bereich der
kuenstlichen Intelligenz ein geeignetes Beispiel ab.  Obwohl man sich
in diesem Zusammenhang darum bemueht, taetige menschliche Intelligenz
in ihren authentischen Ablaeufen nachzubilden, zeichnet sich doch
gerade dieser Bereich paradoxerweise dadurch aus, dass er hergebrachte
Werte und Begriffe, die zur Schriftkultur gehoeren, bewahrt.

Wer mit Bildern in dem Masse aufwaechst, in dem vorausgegangene
Generationen der Schriftkultur verpflichtet waren, entwickelt zu
Bildern ein anderes Verhaeltnis.  Die verfuegbare Technologie zur
Visualisierung foerdert neue Wege der Interaktion.  Diese Technologie
veraendert dabei nicht nur Wissenschaft und Technik.  Sie beeinflusst
unseren taeglichen Umgang miteinander, mit Menschen und voellig anderen,
weit entfernten Kulturkreisen und unseren Umgang mit Geraeten und
Maschinen.  Sie stellt ein alternatives Medium fuer unser Denken und
unsere Kreativitaet bereit, wie sie es in der Geschichte von Technik,
Handwerk und Design schon immer getan hat.  Sie hilft uns dabei,
unsere Umwelt besser zu verstehen, insbesondere die vielfaeltigen
Veraenderungen, die wir durch unsere Lebenspraxis in ihr hervorrufen.
Mit Hilfe von Visualisierungen erfahren wir raeumliche Dimensionen,
die jenseits unserer unmittelbaren Wahrnehmung liegen, und das
Verhalten von Gegenstaenden in diesen Raeumen.  Visualisierungen
erweitern den Bereich der kuenstlerischen, aber auch
wissenschaftlichen Kreativitaet.

Die Printmedien, die ohnehin Schriftlichkeit und Sehvermoegen
zusammenfuehren, betonen heute die visuelle Komponente mehr denn je.
Wir sind zur Kommunikation nicht mehr ausschliesslich den
sequentiellen schriftlichen Sprachformen ausgesetzt, aus teils guten,
teils zweifelhaften Gruenden.  Eine visuelle Sprache begegnet uns in
Form von Comic Strips, Werbung, Wetterkarten, Wirtschaftsberichten
und zahlreichen anderen bildlichen Darstellungen.  Einiges davon wird
nach wie vor zu Papier gebracht, anderes in neuen dynamischen
Darstellungsformen dargeboten, deren Moeglichkeiten wir angedeutet
haben, und die das, was vor wenigen Jahrzehnten noch utopischer Traum
weniger Visionaere war, zur Alltagsroutine gemacht haben.

Auch dort, wo bildliche Darstellungen bislang kaum von Bedeutung
waren, spielen die Moeglichkeiten der Bildverwertung eine zunehmend
groessere Rolle--im politischen Bereich, im juristischen Diskurs, in
der Verwaltung.  Bildbeweise gewinnen in Gerichtsverfahren an
Bedeutung, Geschworene koennen nicht nur die Ergebnisse forensischer
Untersuchungen, sondern das Verbrechen selbst per Bild nachvollziehen.
Damit sind menschliche Schicksale nicht mehr nur von individuellem
Erinnerungs- und Vorstellungsvermoegen oder von rhetorischen
Faehigkeiten der Rechtsanwaelte abhaengig.  Steuerausgaben werden
veranschaulicht, politische Argumente im Bild vorgestellt.  Wenn ein
Politiker im Netzwerk eine bestimmte Leistung fuer sich beansprucht,
kann sein Anspruch mit realen Bildern gestuetzt oder in Frage gestellt
werden.  Politische Versprechen koennen noch waehrend einer
Wahlkampfrede modellhaft durchgespielt und dargestellt, die
Entscheidung ueber eine militaerische Aktion durch ein sofortiges
Referendum ueberprueft werden, waehrend gleichzeitig diese Aktion
gegebenenfalls mit Alternativen auf Monitoren simuliert wird.  Der
Citoyen (Buerger) wird zum Netoyen (englisch netizen): der Buerger als
vernetztes Subjekt.  Alle diese Moeglichkeiten grundsaetzlich zu
verherrlichen, waere indes toericht.  Der Missbrauch von Bildern ist
genauso gross wie der moegliche Segen, der von einer vernuenftigen
Verwendung ausgehen kann.

Dennoch verzeichnet die Ausbildung visuell gebildeter Menschen nicht
die gewuenschten Fortschritte.  Noch immer erfinden wir das Rad neu,
wenn wir unsere Bildungsformen ausschliesslich auf Schriftlichkeit und
Schriftkultur gruenden und dabei eine umfassende visuelle Ausbildung
vernachlaessigen.  Visuelle Alternativen, die lediglich der
Illustration des traditionellen Materials dienen, bekraeftigen das
traditionelle System und genuegen nicht den heutigen
Effizienzerwartungen.  Ausserdem sind sie oft unwesentlich, schlecht
und teuer.  Statt Kommunikation zu foerdern, lenken und manipulieren
sie sie.  Wir benoetigen eine visuelle Bildung, genauer: eine Vielzahl
solcher visueller Alphabetismen, die allesamt weniger begrenzend,
weniger dauerhaft und weniger kompartimentiert sind, um unsere
Selbstkonstituierungund Persoenlichkeitsentfaltung in Bildern zu
verbessern.  Die ethischen Aspekte solcher Erfahrungen beduerfen noch
der Loesung, besonders angesichts der Tatsache, dass die Beschraenkungen
des Visuellen anderer Art sind als diejenigen, die im Buchstaben
unserer Gesetze und moralischen (oder religioesen) UEberzeugungen
angelegt sind.

Ich hoffe gezeigt zu haben, dass es nicht darum geht, eine Form von
Bildung und Alphabetismus durch eine andere zu ersetzen.  Die Dynamik
des derzeit zu beobachtenden Prozesses erfordert vielmehr den
UEbergang von einer einzigen, alles beherrschenden Form
schriftkultureller Bildung zu einer Vielfalt hoechst anpassungsfaehiger
Zeichensysteme.  Diese Anpassungsfaehigkeit drueckt sich in den
erforderlichen neuen Kompetenzen aus.  Auch sollten wir uns um ein
Verstaendnis der integrativen Prozesse bemuehen, damit sich die
individuellen Faehigkeiten und Leistungen in einem durch extreme
Arbeitsteilung und Spezialisierung gekennzeichneten Rahmen der
menschlichen Identitaetsfindung optimal entfalten koennen.  Wenn Sehen
gleichbedeutend mit Glauben ist, dann ist das Glauben all dessen, was
wir heutzutage zu sehen bekommen, eine Angelegenheit, auf die wir
letztendlich nur schlecht vorbereitet sind.



Kapitel 2:


Der professionelle Sieger

Die Bezuege zwischen Sport und Schriftkultur sind alles andere als
offensichtlich.  Das Zuschauen bei einer Sportveranstaltung setzt
keine sonderliche Bildung voraus, und um in einer sportlichen
Disziplin oder einer Mannschaft ein Star zu werden, bedarf es keiner
besonderen Lese- und Schreibfaehigkeiten.  Die mit Sport verbundenen
Taetigkeiten und Ablaeufe gehoeren zu unserem alltaeglichen koerperlichen
Repertoire und bildeten einstmals die Grundlage fuer die primitiven
UEberlebenstechniken.  Auch die auf koerperliche Leistungsfaehigkeit
bezogenen magisch-mythischen Rituale koennen ohne Rekurs auf muendliche
oder schriftliche Sprachlichkeit erklaert werden.  Aussergewoehnliche
physische Faehigkeiten wurden und werden noch heute in einigen
Kulturen als Ausdruck von Kraeften gedeutet, die sich unserer direkten
Kontrolle und unserem Verstaendnis entziehen.  Goetterverehrung nahm
oft die Form aussergewoehnlicher koerperlicher Leistung an; in
archaischen Kulturen wurden Athleten als Dankesopfer dargebracht,
weil das Beste den Goettern zum Wohlgefallen diente.

Fruehe Formen dessen, was spaeter Sport genannt wurde, fielen zeitlich
mit der Entwicklung jener Zeichensysteme (Gesten, Laute, Formen)
zusammen, die schliesslich zur Schrift fuehrten.  Es war eine
synkretistische Entwicklungsphase, in der das Physische den Intellekt
beherrschte.  Das Laufen bei der Jagd und das Laufen als Spiel sind
zwei gaenzlich verschiedene Erfahrungsformen, die unterschiedlichen
pragmatischen Kontexten angehoeren, sie verfolgen unterschiedliche
Zwecke und zeitigen unterschiedliche Ergebnisse.  Zwischen diesen
Erfahrungsformen liegen etwa 20000 Jahre.  Der in einem Wettkampf
ausgedrueckte Grad der Abstraktion und Verallgemeinerung setzte
Selbsterfahrungen voraus, in denen sich das Verhaeltnis vom Physischen
zum Geistigen radikal veraenderte.  Die Bezeichnung Sport entwickelte
sich vermutlich in dem lebenspraktischen Rahmen, in dem sich die
Trennung von saekularen und nicht-saekularen Formen der Lebenspraxis
vollzog.  Die Pflege und Ausbildung der biologischen Anlagen und
magisch-mythische Praktiken beruhten beide auf der Einsicht in die
besondere Bedeutung des Koerpers und in die Notwendigkeit, diese
Einsicht allgemein zu verbreiten.  Die beherrschende Antriebskraft
war auch hier die Effizienz, nicht als solche bewusst gemacht, nicht
begrifflich gefasst, aber anerkannt im Koerperkult und in dem Bemuehen,
diesen zum Teil der allgemeinen Kultur zu machen.  Wettkampf
(griechisch athlos) und Preis (griechisch athlon, woraus sich der
Begriff Athlet ergab) sind Verallgemeinerungen jener
lebenspraktischen Situationen, die UEberleben und Wohlergehen
befoerdert hatten.

Sport ist eine komplexe Erfahrung mit rationalen und irrationalen
Komponenten, die im Verhaeltnis von Sport und Schriftkultur beide eine
Rolle spielen.  Wir wollen uns die Entwicklung anschauen, die den
Sport in seiner heutigen Form hat entstehen lassen: einerseits ein
Freizeit- und Entspannungsphaenomen, andererseits eine hochkompetitive
Form der Arbeit, die wie jedes andere Produkt menschlicher Arbeit auf
dem Markt gehandelt wird.

Die Verbindung zwischen dem Ergebnis koerperlicher Arbeit und
koerperlicher Leistungsfaehigkeit stellte sich im Zusammenhang einer
sehr begrenzten, aber stark strukturierten Taetigkeit ein.  Sie wurde
schnell zum Massstab des UEberlebenserfolgs, und so drueckt sich die
Rationalitaet einer Lebensgemeinschaft, fuer die das UEberleben der
Tuechtigsten zur alltaeglichen Erfahrung gehoert, im Prinzip des
Wettkampfs und der Konkurrenz aus.  Athleten fanden sich zum
Wettkampf ein, um den Goettern wohlgefaellig zu sein, um Fruchtbarkeit,
Regen oder ein laengeres Leben zu erflehen oder Daemonen zu vertreiben.
Viele Petroglyphen und fruehe Schriftdokumente heben die Rolle des
Staerkeren, Schnelleren und Geschickteren heraus.  Alle Kulturen haben
Hinweise darauf ueberliefert, dass das Koerperliche und dessen
besonderer symbolischer Status eine wichtige Rolle gespielt haben.

Die Einsicht, dass einige biologische Merkmale des Menschen seine
UEberlebenschancen erhoehten, fuehrte auch zum Verstaendnis der
Rationalitaet des Koerpers.  Die Einbindung dieser Rationalitaet in eine
Kultur des Koerperbewusstseins fuehrte zu praktischen Erfahrungen der
Selbstentfaltung, die schliesslich im Profisport ihren vorlaeufigen
Endpunkt fand.  Ein irrationales Element liegt darin, dass alle Maenner
und Frauen zwar struktural gleich, manche aber dennoch physisch
vorteilhafter ausgestattet sind.  Wie bei allen anderen Formen der
Identitaetsfindung wurde auch hier das Unerklaerbare einem
Erklaerungsbereich zugewiesen, der jeglicher Rationalitaet entbehrt.
Deshalb werden Bitten um Regen und Gesundheit oder das Vertreiben
boeser Geister mit sportlicher Taetigkeit verknuepft.  Der Kult des
Koerpers, besonders bestimmter Koerperteile, ergab sich aus Erfahrungen
des Menschen, die zum Bewusstsein seiner selbst fuehrten.  Als Koerper
und Koerperteile Selbstzweck wurden, stand die Rationalitaet
koerperlicher Leistungsfaehigkeit zu UEberlebenszwecken zu anderen,
jenseits individuellen oder kollektiven Wohlergehens liegenden
Gruenden im Widerspruch.  Ritual und Mythos, Religion und Politik
nahmen sich dieser irrationalen Komponenten an.  In
fruehgeschichtlichen Kulturen, in denen die Kenntnis koerperlicher
Phaenomene noch nicht sonderlich ausgepraegt war, wurde von der
physischen Leistungskraft der wettstreitenden Athleten auf das
zukuenftige Wohlergehen der ganzen Gesellschaft geschlossen.

Muessen wir in einem Zusammenhang, in dem das UEberleben der
Tuechtigsten an koerperliche Leistungsstaerke gebunden war, von der
Vorstellung ausgehen, dass ein Kaempfer aehnlich einem allein lebenden
Tier, das sich den anderen nur zu Paarungszwecken anschliesst, allein
auf sich gestellt aus der Menge herausragt und sich nur dem Kampf
stellt, um zu toeten oder getoetet zu werden?  Wohl nicht.  Der Mensch
hat sich stets in kooperativen Formen entfaltet, wie primitiv sie
urspruenglich auch waren.  Bis zu einer bestimmten Skala ging der
Kampf immer nur ums UEberleben, er setzte sich um in Nahrungssuche und
Fortpflanzung.  Erst als die Landbewirtschaftung mehr Nahrung als
unmittelbar benoetigt produzierte, verlagerte sich der Kampf vom
UEberlebenskampf zur Selbstbestaetigung im Wettkampf.  Wettkampf und
Leistungserwartung fielen mit den Anfaengen der Schrift zusammen und
wurden dann zunehmend als Teil des kommunalen Lebens begriffen.  Jede
weitere Veraenderung des menschlichen Daseins fuehrte zu entsprechend
veraenderten Erwartungen an die koerperliche Leistungskraft, die den
jeweiligen Effizienzerwartungen entsprachen.


Sport und Selbstkonstituierung

Gymnastik als Koerperkultur steht auch im Zusammenhang mit der
Entwicklung der Kunst.  Sie ist nicht nur zufaellige Abfolge von
Bewegungsuebungen, sondern hat physische und metaphysische Dimensionen;
letztere haben zu tun mit der Suche nach idealen Proportionen, die
in philosophischen Zusammenhaengen gesucht und ausformuliert wurden.

Entsprechend der Grundthese dieses Buches, dass sich die
Menschheitsentwicklung als fortschreitende Selbstkonstituierung in
praktischen Lebenszusammenhaengen vollzieht, ist auch Sport keine
reflexive, sondern eine konstitutive Erfahrung.  In der Ausuebung
sportlicher Taetigkeiten entfalten die Menschen ihre koerperlichen
Eigenschaften und deren Koordinierung.  Diese Entfaltung gehoert zur
Identitaetsfindung und damit auch zur Eingliederung in eine
interaktive Gruppe Gleichgesinnter.  Die Forschung fuehrt die Anfaenge
des Sports im wesentlichen auf UEberlebenstechniken zurueck und stellt
ihn damit in den Zusammenhang der Darwinschen Evolutionstheorie.  Aus
der Perspektive eines Joggers erweist sich der Dauerlauf aber eher
als eine sehr persoenliche, individuelle Erfahrung.  Grundsaetzlich ist
aber auch das Laufen eine gemeinschaftliche Angelegenheit von
Menschen, die der koerperlichen Ertuechtigung einen bestimmten Wert und
soziale, kulturelle, wirtschaftliche und medizinische Bedeutung
beimessen.  Wir schaffen uns nicht nur durch Dichtung,
Landbewirtschaftung oder die Herstellung von Maschinen, sondern auch
durch sportliche Taetigkeit.  Der Sport besitzt wie die anderen
praktischen Erfahrungen natuerliche, kulturelle und soziale
Dimensionen, die beim Erlebnis eines Sportereignisses
zusammmentreffen.  Das Zusammenspiel der verschiedenen Dimensionen
kann Gegenstand eines Berichts werden: die Erklaerung der Leistung
durch Training, Veranlagung, durch soziale Bedingungen (Stolz,
Ehrgeiz, Patriotismus).  Vielen erscheint die Bedeutung eines
Sportereignisses daher auch nicht in der diesem Ereignis jeweils
eigenen Dynamik und dem speziellen Ablauf des einzelnen Wettkampfs,
sondern als vorbestimmt, wie in den magisch-mythischen Koerperkulten
ja auch diese Bedeutung den gesamten Vorgang bestimmte.  Dem Verlauf
eines Fussall- oder Hockeyspiels wird man diese Bedeutung nicht mehr
direkt ablesen koennen.  Sie sind zu spezialisiert und stellen nichts
dar als sich selbst.  Aber ein Spiel kann doch auch andere Funktionen
zugewiesen bekommen und statt eines nach bestimmten Regeln
ablaufenden Wettkampfes zu einem Nervenkrieg, zur Darstellung von
Gewalt, Nationalstolz oder zu reinem Exhibitionismus degenerieren.

Trotz identischer koerperlicher Anlagen der Menschen hat der Sport in
unterschiedlichen Kulturen doch unterschiedliche Formen und
Bedeutungen angenommen.  Ich habe dabei nicht die Freudsche oder
marxistische Theorie des Sports im Auge oder Huizingas Homo ludens.
Ich erklaere die Unterschiede viel mehr aus den unterschiedlichen
Kontexten, in denen sie sich wie jede andere Form menschlicher
Erfahrung entwickelt haben, also aus einer pragmatischen Perspektive.
Wenn ein Japaner in einem Kemari genannten Spiel gegen einen Ball
tritt, dann hat das mit Fussball wenig zu tun.  Wenn ein
buddhistischer Bogenschuetze den Bogen spannt, dann ist dieser Ablauf,
in dem das Verlangen nach Einheit mit der Welt zum Ausdruck kommt,
ein anderer als beim Bogenschiessen afrikanischer Staemme oder beim
Bogenwettkampf der antiken Olympischen Spiele.  Viele Beispiele
koennten dies ergaenzen.  Vielleicht sollten wir uns die
Bewegungsablaeufe juengerer, nicht aus dem Symbolismus vergangener
Zeiten hervorgegangener Sportarten wie Baseball, Wassergymnastik oder
Eistanz anschauen, um zu sehen, welche Aspekte menschlicher Taetigkeit
jeweils in sie eingegangen sind und welche Erfahrungsformen sie fuer
die Beteiligten ergeben.  UEberraschend ist vor allem die Vielfalt.
Die menschliche Phantasie ersinnt immer wieder neue Wettkaempfe, in
denen Sportler ihre koerperliche Leistungsfaehigkeit messen koennen.
Ebenfalls wenig ueberraschend ist die Tatsache, dass sie alle dabei
bestimmte Regeln befolgen, Spielregeln oder auch solche der aeusseren
Erscheinung (Kleiderregeln u. ae.).  Neben solchen standardisierten
Erfahrungsmustern findet sich auch eine von diesem Standard
abweichende Praxis in Form von individuellen Regeln,
ad-hocKonventionen und privaten Wettkaempfen.  Die soziale und die
private Ebene des Sports haengen lose zusammen.  Als Profisportler muss
man die Regeln der standardisierten Erfahrung in bestimmten
Organisationsformen oder in anerkannten Wettkaempfen befolgen.  Im
uebrigen befindet sich derjenige, der einem Beruf im sportlichen
Bereich nachgeht, in einer ganz aehnlichen Situation.  Hier ist die
Schriftkultur das Medium, das die Regeln fasst.


Sprache und koerperliche Leistung

Uns interessiert nicht die AEhnlichkeit zwischen, sondern der
Zusammenhang von Sport und Sprache.  Ein offensichtlicher
Zusammenhang besteht darin, dass wir die Sprache zur Beschreibung von
Sportereignissen und deren Bedeutung verwenden.  Das heisst nicht, dass
es ohne Sprache keinen Sport gaebe.  Sport wurde zum Teil des
gesellschaftlichen Lebens, als sich Schriftsprachen herausbildeten.
Genuegend visuelle Darstellungen (Petroglyphen und spaeter
Hieroglyphen) deuten darauf hin, dass nicht nur die koerperliche
Taetigkeit und die dazugehoerige UEbung als solche (z. B. die Jagd nach
wilden Tieren) beachtet, sondern die koerperlich Tuechtigen auf
besondere Weise herausgehoben und behandelt wurden--im Grabmal des
aegyptischen Pharao Beni Hasan ist der Ringkampf in allen seinen
Varianten abgebildet.

Die Bewegungsmuster des Ballspiels im Kemari und die Muster der
Sprachverwendung im selben Kulturkreis haengen nicht unmittelbar
zusammen.  Aber das Spiel ist durch ein Konfigurationsprinzip
gekennzeichnet: Zweck des Spiels ist es, den Ball so lange wie
moeglich in der Luft zu halten.  Fussball, auch das amerikanische
football, ist sequentieller Natur: Ziel des Spiels ist es, mehr Tore
als der Gegner zu erzielen.  Im Kemari ist das Spielfeld durch vier
verschiedene Baeume markiert: Weide, Kirsche, Pinie und Ahorn.  Beim
Fussball sind die Spielfeldgrenzen kuenstlich gezogen, ausserhalb derer
die Spielregeln sinnlos waeren.  Auch die Sprachen beider Kulturkreise
sind durch unterschiedliche Strukturen gekennzeichnet, die
unterschiedlichen Erfahrungszusammenhaengen entsprechen.

Die ihnen jeweils innewohnende Logik beeinflusst offenbar die Logik
der Sportart.  Kemari ist nicht nur nicht-praedikativ und konfigurativ,
sondern vom Prinzip des ame beherrscht, das den Zusammenhang der
Dinge betont.  Fussball und football sind analytische Planungsspiele,
Texte, deren Endpunkt das erzielte Tor oder der touchdown ist.  Die
Mentalitaet, also der Ausdruck, den eine praktische Erfahrung in
bestimmten musterhaften Erwartungen findet, spielt im Sport also
ebenfalls keine geringe Rolle.

Sport ist ein Ausdrucksmittel.  In der Ausuebung einer sportlichen
Taetigkeit druecken sich nicht nur koerperliche, sondern auch geistige
Faehigkeiten aus: Selbstkontrolle, Koordination, Planung.
Urspruenglich haben sich koerperliche Leistung und einfache
Sprachformen ergaenzt.  Spaeter gehen sie eigene Wege, ohne sich
allerdings jemals ganz zu trennen (wie die Olympischen Spiele der
Antike zeigen).  Als die Sprache an ihre relativen Grenzen kam,
konnten die Ausdrucksformen des Sports einige Funktionen uebernehmen:
Nicht die allergroesste Sprachfertigkeit koennte je die Dramatik eines
Wettkampfes, die Tragoedie einer Niederlage oder das Hochgefuehl eines
Sieges wiedergeben.  Interessanter noch ist das, was die Sprache dem
Sport abgewann.  Sie griff einige der typischen Merkmale des Sports
auf, verallgemeinerte sie und uebertrug sie in veraenderter Form auf
Gebiete, die mit Sport nicht mehr das Geringste zu tun haben: Sport
statt Krieg, Sport als Ordnungsprinzip oder als Zirkus fuer die Massen.
Zuallererst aber gewannen die Menschen dem Sport den
Wettbewerbsgedanken ab als nationale Eigenschaft, aber auch als
Merkmal der Bildung, der Kunst und des Marktes.

Der in der Sprache rationalisierte Wettbewerbsgedanke fuehrte zu
Vergleich und zu Leistungsmessung, womit die Grundlagen fuer eine
Sportbuerokratie und die institutionalisierten Aspekte des Sports
gelegt waren.  Die Griechen hofierten die jeweiligen Sieger.
Zeitmessgeraete kamen erst spaeter zum Einsatz, vor allem, als in einem
allgemeinen Rahmen von Besitz, Recht und Erbrecht die Dokumentation
von Fakten an Bedeutung gewann.  Das Spiel bedarf keiner Sprache, die
Schrift aber ermoeglichte es, allgemein verbindliche Regeln zu
formulieren, die dann die Natur des jeweiligen Spiels auf Dauer
festlegten.  Insofern ist die sich in organisierten Wettkaempfen
niederschlagende Institutionalisierung des Sports ein Produkt der
Schriftkultur und weist deren pragmatische Erwartungen auf.

In jeder Sportart verbirgt sich die Sehnsucht nach Natur und Freiheit,
eine Reminiszenz der ueberkommenen UEberlebensstrategien des Jagens
und des Fischens.  Ihrer Natur nach verraet die jeweilige Disziplin
aber zugleich die Veraenderungen, die im Verhaeltnis des Menschen zur
natuerlichen und sozialen Umwelt und zur von ihm geschaffenen
kuenstlichen Welt eingetreten sind.  Das Schiessen auf Zielscheiben
oder mit Laserstrahlen in Nintendo-Spielen steht eben am anderen Ende
der menschlichen Entwicklung.  Jene Umstaende, die zwangslaeufig zur
Schriftkultur gefuehrt hatten, aenderten auch den Status der
sportlichen Taetigkeit.  Der Wettkampf wurde zu einem Produkt mit
besonderem Status; der Siegerpreis versinnbildlicht den zeitlichen
Prozess, durch den der Wettkampf evaluiert wird.

Allen Guttman hat folgende Kennzeichen des heutigen Sports
herausgestellt: Saekularitaet, Chancengleichheit, hochspezialisierte
Rollenverteilung, Rationalisierung, Buerokratisierung, Quantifizierung
und Streben nach neuen Rekorden.  Er hat die Merkmale jedoch nicht
mit den allgemeinen Strukturen des Sports korreliert und im
Zusammenhang mit der allgemeinen menschlichen Lebenspraxis bewertet.
Unter diesem Gesichtspunkt naemlich wuerde sich Effizienz als viel
wichtiger als etwa die sogenannte Chancengleichheit, Quantifizierung
oder Buerokratie erweisen.  Der Effizienzgedanke wird evident, wenn
wir die komplizierten, bisweilen obskuren Regeln sportlicher
Veranstaltungen in ritualistischen Kulturen mit Ansaetzen vergleichen,
diese Regeln zu vereinfachen und die Ablaeufe so transparent wie
moeglich zu gestalten.  Als einige afrikanische Staemme den
europaeischen Fussball uebernahmen, stellten sie ihn in den Kontext
ihrer rituellen Handlungen.  Saemtliche kulturellen Voraussetzungen
dieses Spiels wurden aufgegeben und durch andere, aus einem anderen
Praxiszusammenhang stammende Voraussetzungen ersetzt.  Der Inyanga
(Medizinmann) war fuer das Ergebnis verantwortlich; Spieler und
Anhaenger mussten die Nacht vor dem Spiel gemeinsam am Lagerfeuer
verbringen; Ziegen wurden als Opfergaben dargebracht.  Die Zeremonie
wurde zum entscheidenden Strukturmerkmal, nicht das Spiel; Sieg oder
Niederlage waren sekundaer.  Erst als jene Staemme naeher mit
schriftkulturellen Zivilisationen in Beziehung traten, gewann der
utilitaristische Aspekt die Oberhand.  Die Fussballspieler aus Afrika,
die heute in den ersten Ligen der europaeischen Laender Millionaere
werden, erkennen nur die Rituale des Siegers (und die entsprechende
Praemie) an.  Und wenn wir daraufhin den europaeischen Fussball mit dem
amerikanischen football vergleichen, wird ebenfalls evident, wie sich
aus veraenderten Strukturen der Lebenspraxis neue sportliche Muster
herausbilden.

In unserem Zusammenhang ist die Tatsache wichtig, dass die
Schriftkultur neben anderen Formen der Lebenspraxis auch den Sport im
Rahmen der fuer die Industriegesellschaft typischen Dynamik nachhaltig
gepraegt hat.  Als Wiege des Industriezeitalters ist England zugleich
der Ausgangspunkt fuer viele Sportarten und andere Formen der
koerperlichen Ertuechtigung gewesen.  Aber mit den Veraenderungen der
Lebenspraxis sind manche der fuer die Industrielle Revolution
wichtigen Entwicklungen ueberholt.  Dazu gehoert z. B. die Isolation
der Nationalstaaten.  Schrift und Schriftkultur foerdern nationale
Eigenheit.  Seinem Wesen nach sollte der Sport ueber den nationalen
Grenzen stehen.  Aber die Erfahrung lehrt uns (und die Olympischen
Spiele 1936 in Berlin sind nur der Extremfall), dass
Sportveranstaltungen im Zeichen der Schriftkultur wie viele andere
Lebensformen nationalistisch durchdrungen wurden.  So degeneriert der
sportliche Wettkampf oft genug zur feindlichen Auseinandersetzung und
zum Konflikt.  Im alten Griechenland, in China oder Japan wurde keine
Leistung gemessen, anstelle des Vergleichs stand die koerperliche
Harmonie und AEsthetik im Vordergrund.  In England wurde der Sport
institutionalisiert und die sportliche Leistung in Rekordlisten
festgehalten.  In England wurde die Geschichte des sportlichen
Wettkampfs als Rechtfertigung dafuer geschrieben, dass er der
gebildeten Oberklasse vorbehalten blieb, ausschliesslich fuer Amateure,
denen der Sieg als Lohn genuegte.

Einige Spiele wurden im Rahmen der Schriftkultur erst erfunden und
mit Funktionen versehen, die auch die Schriftkultur kennzeichnen.
Sie veraenderten sich in dem Masse, in dem sich die Schriftkultur und
ihre Rolle veraenderten, und brachten eine neue Kultur zum Ausdruck,
in der immer mehr Sprachen mit immer begrenzteren Funktionsbereichen
vorherrschten.  Im Informationszeitalter, in dem viele Aufgaben, die
urspruenglich der Sprache zufielen, von anderen Ausdrucksmitteln
uebernommen worden sind, ist Sport fuer viele eine Frage der Datenfuelle
geworden.  Wer sich an der Schoenheit des Tennisspiels erfreut,
interessiert sich erst in zweiter Linie fuer die Geschwindigkeit des
ersten Aufschlags.  Aber nach einer gewissen Zeit wird auch er
begreifen, dass die neuen illiteraten Bedingungen das Spiel und die
Schoenheit seiner Ablaeufe bis zur Unkenntlichkeit veraendert haben.
Wer siegen will, benoetigt einen schnellen und harten Aufschlag, der
aus dem Spiel kaum mehr als einen extremen kurzen (wenn ueberhaupt)
Austausch von harten Schlaegen werden laesst.  AEhnliches gilt fuer
Baseball, American football, Basketball und Hockey: Sie alle sind
begleitet von unzaehligen Statistiken, die fuer den Kenner oft
wichtiger sind als das Spiel selbst.  Die Veraenderungen, denen Natur
und Zweck des Sports unterworfen sind, stehen im Einklang mit dem
Prozess, der eine einzige, allseits beherrschende Sprache durch eine
Vielzahl von begrenzten Sondersprachen ersetzt und damit zugleich die
Notwendigkeit von Schriftkultur und schriftkultureller Bildung
eingeschraenkt hat.


Der ‘illiterate’ Athlet

In der Geschichte des Sports ist das Ideal vom harmonisch
ausgebildeten Menschen durch den Hochleistungsgedanken ersetzt worden.
Die Dynamik, die diese Entwicklung foerderte, ist im Grundsatz
identisch mit jener Dynamik, die alle anderen Formen menschlicher
Entfaltung veraendert hat.  Strukturell handelt es sich dabei um die
Verlagerung von der direkten Auseinandersetzung mit der natuerlichen
Umwelt zu staerker vermittelten Beziehungen zwischen Mensch und Natur.
Die Jagd nach einem Tier, das schliesslich gefangen und verzehrt wird,
hat unmittelbar mit dem UEberleben zu tun.  Neben dem koerperlichen
Aspekt spielen weitere Elemente in der Beziehung Jaeger--Beute eine
Rolle: die Verbergung des Koerpergeruchs; das Anlocken der Beute; das
Beschraenken auf einen unbedingt notwendigen Kraftaufwand.  Spaeter
treten Ritual, Magie und Aberglauben hinzu, ohne dabei das Ergebnis
unbedingt zu befoerdern.

Das Laufen als Training der koerperlichen Leistungsfaehigkeit ist auch
eine unmittelbare Erfahrung, aber hinsichtlich des Ergebnisses
weniger unmittelbar als die Jagd.  Das Training verraet zusaetzliche
Kenntnisse: Wie beeinflusst die Beschaffenheit von Muskeln und
Kreislauf, wie beeinflussen Widerstands- und Willenskraft unser Leben,
unsere Arbeit und unsere Gesundheit?  Es verraet ferner eine
verbliebene Sehnsucht nach der Erfahrung der Koerperlichkeit und nach
einem unmittelbaren Raum- und Zeitgefuehl, das in der kuenstlichen
Umwelt unserer Wohnungen und Arbeitsplaetze verlorengegangen ist.  Das
Laufen aus reiner Freude unterscheidet sich wesentlich vom
zweckgerichteten Laufen--auf der Jagd, nach Freund oder Feind, nach
Beute oder Rekorden.  Das Laufen um des UEberlebens willen ist keine
spezialisierte Taetigkeit; das Laufen bei Kriegsspielen erfordert
einige Spezialkenntnisse; die Weltmeisterschaft im Sport erfordert
die Kenntnisse einer ganzen Reihe von Spezialisten, die am Erfolg des
einzelnen Sportlers beteiligt sind.  Im ersten Fall (Jagd) liegt ein
unmittelbarer Anlass vor; im zweiten Fall ist er weniger unmittelbar
und im dritten (Beute) auf vielfaeltige Weise vermittelt: die Idee vom
Laufen als Wettkampf, die von allen Beteiligten akzeptierte
Streckendistanz, die daran geknuepften Werte und Bedeutungen,
Trainingsmethoden und Ernaehrungsweisen, Sportkleidung.  Vor die
Spezialisierung ist ein Selektionsprozess geschaltet.  Nicht jeder
bringt die fuer eine sportliche Hoechstleistung notwendigen
koerperlichen und geistigen Voraussetzungen mit.  Im Hintergrund
vollzieht sich die Evaluation des marktfaehigen Produkts: des Athleten.
Waehrend dieses Prozesses wird der Mensch verschiedenen Formen der
Entfremdung ausgesetzt, hervorgerufen durch den spuerbaren Schmerz
oder unmerklich vollzogen--ungelesene Buecher schmerzen nicht.  Wir
nehmen in der Regel die Hoehepunkte im Leben eines Sportlers zur
Kenntnis und vergessen dabei den schmerzensreichen Weg, der dem
Erfolg vorausging: harte Arbeit, schwierige Entscheidungen,
zahlreiche Entsagungen und die koerperlichen und geistigen Qualen, die
der Sportler sich im Training und im Wettkampf auferlegen muss.

Wie gebildet muss er sein?  Im Grunde genommen stellt sich die gleiche
Frage beim Arbeiter, Bauern, bei einem Ingenieur, einer Taenzerin oder
einem Wissenschaftler.  Sport und Bildung hingen in einem bestimmten
Kontext einmal eng zusammen.  Der gesamte Schul- und Collegesport
(wie er sich im 19. Jahrhundert in England entwickelt hat) verkoerpert
dieses Ideal: mens sana in corpore sano.  Einige Sportarten und der
Hochleistungsgedanke haben sich aus einer schriftkulturellen
Mentalitaet entwickelt und sind Projektionen von Sprache und
Schriftkultur in die koerperlichen UEbungen.  Tennis ist das vielleicht
bekannteste Beispiel hierfuer.  Mit der Relativierung der
Schriftkultur emanzipierten sich indes auch die Sportarten und
entwickelten ihre eigene Sprache.  Der Sieg als einzig anerkanntes
Ziel stellt die Effizienz in den Vordergrund, die gemessen und
aufgezeichnet wurde.

Bildung und Effizienz in Sportarten, die koerperliche Kraft und
Schnelligkeit voraussetzen, sind nicht unbedingt deckungsgleich.  Man
vergleiche etwa American football, Basketball oder Baseball mit
Langstreckenlauf, Schwimmen oder dem exotischen Bogenschiessen.  Das
klingt nach Klischee und Vorurteil.  Aber es geht uns weder um das
Klischee des ungebildeten Muskelprotzes noch um das des Adligen, der
sein Latein ebenso gut beherrscht wie sein Pferd.  Es geht um das
sportliche Umfeld im allgemeinen.  Fuer das verbreitete Bild des zwar
koerperlich aussergewoehnlich, geistig aber weniger leistungsstarken
Athleten gibt es zwar genuegend Gegenbeispiele, sie stellen aber wohl
dennoch eher die Ausnahme dar.  Das liegt nicht daran, dass
koerperliche und geistige Leistungsfaehigkeit einander ausschliessen,
sondern dass die hohen Effizienzerwartungen es nahezu unmoeglich machen,
in beiden Bereichen mit gleicher Intensitaet zu arbeiten und
entsprechende Leistungen zu erzielen.  Jede Form von Spezialisierung,
auch und gerade im Sport, erfordert eine Konzentration von Energie
und Talent auf die eine Sache.  Jede Entscheidung hat ihren Preis.

Sportliche Hoechstleistung setzt zwar nicht unbedingt hohe Bildung
voraus, wohl aber eine Kenntnis der Sprache des Sports.  Hochleistung
und hohe Effizienz gruenden auf einem bestimmten Typus
hochspezialisierter Kenntnisse und einer speziellen Sprache: genaue
Kenntnis des menschlichen Koerpers, Ernaehrungswissenschaft, Physik,
Chemie, Biologie und Psychologie spielen zusammen.  Und eine jede
einzelne Sportart hat sozusagen ihre eigene Wissenschaft entwickelt,
die das Wissen aus vielen anderen Wissensbereichen zusammentraegt und
zu neuem Spezialwissen fuegt.  Mit der zunehmenden Spezialisierung hat
der Sport seinen Charakter als gemeinschaftliche Taetigkeit verloren.
Man braucht nur das Basketballspiel von Jugendlichen auf unseren
Strassen und Plaetzen zu beobachten und deren Freude am Spiel und an
der Bewegung mit dem professionellen Basketball zu vergleichen.
Letzteres besteht aus einem Team von jeweils nur auf bestimmten
Positionen hochspezialisierten Experten, deren Leistung in hohem Grad
vorhersagbar, begrenzt programmierbar und nur in sehr begrenztem Masse
wirklich originell ist.  Die noetigen Koordinierungsmassnahmen werden
durch die natuerliche Sprache erleichtert; aber die Effizienzerwartung
geht ueber die in der Sprache konstituierte und durch die Sprache
kommunizierte Erfahrung weit hinaus.  Jeder Aspekt des Spiels ist in
Diagrammen und Statistiken notiert; jeder Gegner minutioes auf
Videoband analysiert; staendig werden neue Strategien entwickelt und
taktische Spielzuege eingeuebt.  Am Ende eines Spiels wird diese
spezielle Sprache zum eigentlichen Zweck: In den letzten 30 Sekunden
ist jede Bewegung und jedes Abspiel kalkuliert, jedes Foul (und die
dadurch gewonnene oder verstrichene Zeit) eingeplant.

Eine nicht geringe Rolle im Hintergrund spielt dabei die Technologie,
die dem Zuschauer oft gar nicht zu Bewusstsein kommt.  Sie hat mit
Schriftkultur meist gar nichts mehr zu tun.  Aber die Aufzeichnung
und Auswertung von Bewegungsmustern, die zur Hoechstleistung fuehren,
und die staendige Optimierung dieser Muster und Erprobung oder
Simulation neuer Ablaeufe, meist individuell auf einen bestimmten
Sportler und seine persoenlichen Daten zugeschnitten, gehoeren heute
zum Alltag des Leistungssports.  Oft genug werden dabei Grenzen
ueberschritten, Regeln sehr grosszuegig interpretiert und die Siege
durch Mittel erstrebt, die mit den hehren Idealen von Fairness und
Chancengleichheit nur noch wenig zu tun haben.

Schon immer hat der Sport die gesetzten Grenzen getestet.  Einmal
gebrochene Regeln konnten ihrerseits zur neuen Regel werden.  Von
aussen herangetragene Elemente (mystische, vom Aberglauben geleitete,
medizinische, technische und psychologische) sollten die Leistung
erhoehen.  Das Problem des Doping ist unter diesem allgemeinen
Effizienzgedanken vor dem Hintergrund der allgemein abnehmenden
schriftkulturellen Bildung zu sehen.  Die Sprachen der Stimulanzien,
Strategien und Technologien gehoeren zusammen, auch wenn einige mehr,
andere weniger unmoralisch und gefaehrlich sind.  Und da die Drogen
immer raffinierter und entsprechend schwieriger nachweisbar werden,
laesst sich gar nicht mehr genau sagen, welches Ergebnis auf rein
sportliche Leistung und welches auf Biochemie zurueckzufuehren ist.

Nicht nur die ehemaligen totalitaeren Staaten des Ostblocks haben die
Gruselgeschichten des Medikamentenmissbrauchs geschrieben.  Auch die
kommerzielle Demokratie mit ihren materiellen Verlockungen veranlasst
viele Sportler, die Leistungsfaehigkeit des Koerpers bis zur
Selbstzerstoerung voranzutreiben.  Zu den gebrochenen Rekorden bei den
Olympischen Spielen in Atlanta gehoert auch die Zahl der
Dopingkontrollen (fast 20% aller aktiven Teilnehmer).

Von allen Sportarten ist der American Football wohl die erste
postmoderne Sportart, die sich im Verlauf der Zeit konsequent an die
neuen Erfordernisse angepasst hat.  Wenngleich die Sprache dieser
Sportart vermutlich nur einem Eingeweihten verstaendlich ist, sei das
Phaenomen hier kurz resuemiert.  Wie keine andere hat sie hochgradige
Spezialisierung, Vermittlung, eine voellig neue Dynamik und eine ganz
eigene Sprache entwickelt.  Neben den 22 Positionen und den
besonderen Formationen fuer bestimmte Spielphasen und Spielzuege wird
jede der zahlreichen Funktionen innerhalb und ausserhalb der
Mannschaft von speziellen Arbeitsteams unterstuetzt: Besitzer, Manager,
Trainer, Trainerassistenten und Betreuer, Spielerbeobachter und
Spielervermittler, AErzte und Berater.  Die Regeln und das
Grundrepertoire an Ablaeufen sind nicht sehr umfangreich.  Sie folgen
wie in vielen anderen Spielformen schriftkulturellen Prinzipien: in
ihrer totalitaeren und zentralistischen Anlage, in der Befolgung eines
bestimmten Regelwerks und damit in ihrer Sequentialitaet.  Verbale und
numerische Signale, Farbkodes u. ae. gehoeren zum Zeichencharakter des
Spiels, das dem nicht Eingeweihten als reine, nach privaten Kodes
ablaufende Komoedie erscheinen muss, was durch die merkwuerdige
Ausruestung der Spieler gewiss noch erhoeht wird.  Die Entwicklung von
einer Collegesportart traditionell englischer Praegung zu dieser
zeitgenoessischen amerikanischen Variante laesst sich nachvollziehen.
Im Vordergrund standen ab einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt nicht mehr das
Spiel und die Erfahrung des gemeinsamen Spielens, sondern der
unbedingte Wunsch nach Sieg. Der erhoehte Effizienzbedarf erforderte
effizientere Spielmaschinen, die sich auf eine begrenzte Auswahl von
Spielfunktionen beschraenkten, diese perfektionierten und nur fuer
diese Aufgaben eingesetzt wurden.  Das Spiel gewann einen
Konfigurationscharakter, spielt sich auf mehreren Ebenen ab, verteilt
die Aufgaben nach einem strengen Schema und kann auf ein
kompliziertes Kommunikationsnetzwerk zurueckgreifen, das das
Zusammenspiel der Funktionen sichert.  Die offene Gewalt ist im
Gegensatz zur inszenierten Clownerie des Wrestling authentisch und
spiegelt fuer viele das Konkurrenzgefuehl und die Feindseligkeit der
heutigen Gesellschaft wider.  Alle Schreckgespenster des modernen
Sports sind hier vereinigt: Gewalt, Verletzung, Anabolika, Drogen,
illegales Geld--und Statistiken.  Der Geist dieser Sportart uebertraegt
sich zunehmend auf andere Sportarten und andere Lebensbereiche in
Politik und Geschaeftswelt.  Beim Baseball sind Statistiken sogar noch
wichtiger.  Sie begleiten nahezu jede einzelne Bewegung des Spiels
und verleihen ihr eine Bedeutung, die dem Zuschauer ansonsten
entgehen wuerde.

Der Zusammenhang zwischen dieser neuen Dynamik des Sports und der
allgemeinen neuen Dynamik des menschlichen Daseins ist offensichtlich.
Groessere Schnelligkeit, kuerzere Zweikaempfe und kuerzere Aktionsphasen
machen Sportereignisse in unserer heutigen Gesellschaft besser
vermarktbar.  Je genauer die einzelne Ausfuehrung, desto weniger
ausdrucksstark wird sie.  Niemand war beim Eiskunstlaufen mehr an den
Pflichtfiguren interessiert, also wurden sie abgeschafft.  Aber die
Kuer wird von einem Millionenpublikum bewundert und geraet immer mehr
zu einer Showveranstaltung.  Je ausdauernder die Leistung, desto
geringer die Attraktivitaet.  Eine rasante kurze Abfahrt ist allemal
aufregender als ein Langstreckenereignis.  All dies ist ganz
entschieden ein Kennzeichen unseres neuen Lebens jenseits der
Schriftkultur.  Niemand will mehr lernen, wie er die gleichen
Leistungen erbringen koennte; Wissen und Lernen sind irrelevant
geworden.  Was zaehlt, ist die Leistung und das Spektakel, und das
bringt die Preise ein, von denen die Sieger der antiken Olympiade,
die auf ihre Weise auch verwoehnt wurden, nicht einmal traeumen konnten.
"Winner take all"--der Sieger bekommt alles: Das ist das
vorherrschende Gesetz, demzufolge nicht mehr die Freude am Wettkampf,
sondern der Sieg einziger Zweck ist.

Die Folge dieser Effizienzerwartung ist nicht nur ein relativ
ungebildeter Sportler, sondern auch eine diskriminierende Vorauswahl.
In den USA werden die Volkssportarten Football und Basketball von
schwarzen Athleten beherrscht.  Wenn man im Sport dieselben
Gleichheitsprinzipien wie in anderen Lebensbereichen anwenden wuerde,
verloere er an Attraktivitaet.  Das fuehrt ironischerweise dazu, dass in
den USA die schwarzen Afroamerikaner die Rolle des Entertainer fuer
die weisse Bevoelkerung spielen.  Abgesehen von den enormen
Verdienstmoeglichkeiten im Profisport fuehrt die Leistungsbesessenheit
dazu, dass ein bestimmter, wichtiger Teil der Bevoelkerung den
Unterhalter fuer die restliche Bevoelkerung spielt.  Schwarze
beherrschen auch die besten BasketballLigen der restlichen Welt.  In
der ehemaligen Sowjetunion rekrutierten sich die Teilnehmer an den
Olympischen Winterspielen weitgehend aus der sibirischen Bevoelkerung,
fuer die das Skilaufen eine alltaegliche Lebensform ist.  In ganz
Europa holen die fuehrenden Fussballvereine (und sogar
Nationalmannschaften) ihre Spieler aus Spanien, Italien, Afrika und
Suedamerika.  Denn Effizienz ist leichter mit denen zu erreichen, die
die besseren koerperlichen Voraussetzungen fuer ein bestimmtes Spiel
mitbringen, als mit denen, die man auf traditionelle Art ueber den
Breitensport an eine bestimmte Sportart heranfuehrt.

Die Zuschauer von Sportveranstaltungen sind durch die vermittelnde
Taetigkeit des Fernsehens in ihren Erwartungshaltungen weitgehend
homogenisiert.  Der Sprache des Sports bedingungslos ausgesetzt,
erleben sie das Ereignis und dessen Interpretationen gleichzeitig.
Selbst die Mechanismen der Bedeutungszuweisung sind rationalisiert,
Schriftkultur spielt bei ihrer Vermittlung keine sonderliche Rolle,
eigenes Nachdenken eruebrigt sich.

Diese Veraenderungen im Sport--oder in anderen aehnlich veraenderten
Lebensbereichen--einfach nur zu beklagen, wuerde nicht sehr weit
fuehren.  Gewiss sind die grossen Athleten des heutigen Sports
schriftkulturell ungebildet (um nicht zu sagen Analphabeten).
Dennoch bemuehen sich angesehene Colleges in den USA um sportbegabte
Studierende ausschliesslich um deren sportlicher Leistungsfaehigkeit
willen.  Diese heben zwar nicht das akademische Niveau der
Bildungseinrichtung, wohl aber deren Marktwert.  Bildung ist fuer
sportliche Hoechstleistungen nicht nur unnoetig, sondern vielleicht
sogar hinderlich.  Hochleistungssportler leben aus dem Koffer--in
Flugzeug, Hotel oder Trainingslager--, finden kaum Zeit fuer ihre
Bildung oder auch nur ein eigenes Privatleben.  Ihre begrenzte
Sprache reicht oft nicht einmal aus, ihre Frustration zu artikulieren,
wenn das erstrebte Leistungsziel einmal nicht erreicht wurde.  Sie
lesen nicht, sie schreiben nicht, selbst die Schecks werden von
anderen gezeichnet.

Sport ist Arbeit mit hohem Marktwert ohne schriftkulturellen Status.
Die Effizienz einer Sportart wird an ihrer Attraktivitaet gemessen,
und das heisst an der Faehigkeit, Botschaften von allgemeinem Interesse
zu vermitteln.  Weit entfernt davon, integrativ zu wirken oder das
Ideal eines vollkommenen Menschen zu verwirklichen, ist
Leistungssport heutzutage so spezialisiert wie jede andere
herausgehobene Taetigkeit.  Er stellt einen eigenen Kompetenz- und
Leistungsbereich mit einer eigenen partiellen Literalitaet dar.  Da er
bestimmte koerperliche Eigenschaften und geistige Funktionen erfordert,
ist er zu einer Gussform, zu einer zweiten Natur der Sportler
geworden, mit allen daran geknuepften Folgen.  Weltweit werden heute
in den verbreiteten, durch hohe Effizienzerwartungen gekennzeichneten
Sportarten die spaeteren Athleten praktisch von Geburt an herangezogen.
Kinder werden nach ihrer genetischen Veranlagung und spezifischen
Befaehigung ausgewaehlt, nach individuell zugeschnittenen Trainings-
und Ernaehrungsplaenen ausgebildet und mit psychologischer und anderer
Hilfe so lange begleitet, bis sie sich als fertige Sportler dem
Wettkampf stellen.


Ideeller und profaner Gewinn

Die in den Sport getaetigten Investitionen muessen sich auszahlen.
Niemand erwartet, dass der erfolgreiche Sportler ueber diesen Profit
Rechenschaft ablegt.  Denn niemand fragt auch nach dem Preis der
koerperlichen oder psychischen Schaeden, mit dem er erkauft wurde.
Diese gehoeren zur zynischen Erfolgsformel dazu, die offenbar jeder
begeistert akzeptiert.  Die enorm hohen Summen, die die auf dem Markt
gehandelten Spieler vertraglich zugesichert bekommen, spiegeln fast
bis auf den letzten Pfennig die Hoehe die Zahl derer wider, die ihnen
zuschauen oder die Produkte kaufen, die deren Namen tragen.  In
einigen Laendern ist die Sportwette, ob legal oder illegal, der
Hauptwirtschaftszweig.

Dabei ist die Wette, obwohl sie ihre eigene partielle Literalitaet
entwickelt hat und ohne die Vermittlung von Schreiben und Lesen
auskommt, keineswegs eine neue Erfindung.  Das Spielen mit dem Glueck
hat die Menschheit schon immer fasziniert.  Seitdem indes die
Vernetzung der Welt jedem jederzeit den Zugang zu jedem gewuenschten
Sportereignis ermoeglicht hat, ist die Wette wichtiger geworden als
das Ereignis selbst.  Unsere Sehnsuechte und Traeume werden von denen
getragen, durch die wir uns repraesentiert sehen und auf deren Siege
wir nicht nur hoffen, sondern auch setzen.  Der Sport hat eine
ideelle Seite, den erfolgreichen Spieler, und eine profane, den
finanziellen Einsatz.  Die Hoffnung auf ein gutes Ergebnis leitet
sich aus den Erwartungen der Schriftkultur her.  Hier liegt der naive
Glaube zugrunde, dass sich geistige Bildung und koerperliche
Extremleistung zu einer harmonischen Persoenlichkeit zusammenfuegen
lassen.  Warum dies nicht moeglich ist, brauche ich nicht zu
wiederholen.  Wichtig ist indes, dass die ideelle und die profane
Seite nicht getrennt voneinander zu sehen sind.  Das verleiht dem
Wettkampf eine zusaetzliche, undurchschaubare Dimension, die aus
sportfremden, durch diese indirekte Wette repraesentierten Faktoren
besteht.

Den groessten indirekten Wetteinsatz stellen die Kosten fuer Vermarktung
und Werbung dar.  Die hierfuer aufgebrachten Dollarbetraege in
Milliardenhoehe gehoeren vermutlich zu den spektakulaersten olympischen
Rekorden.  Mit der Verlagerung von der Produktions- zur
Dienstleistungsgesellschaft ist aus dem Sport eine
Unterhaltungsindustrie geworden.  Die neuen Medien tragen die
internationalen Grossereignisse weltweit in jeden Haushalt.  Frueher
haben wir uns mit den Bildern vom Sieger begnuegt.  Heute besitzen wir,
so wir es wollen, eine Videoaufzeichnung des gesamten Spiels und
koennen uns jede Spielphase noch einmal ansehen; mit noch mehr
Breitband koennen wir uns das Ereignis live auf den Monitor holen,
natuerlich gegen Bezahlung (wie im Pay-TV).

Sport ist eine Ware geworden, die wir gegen hohe Bezahlung
konsumieren, je nachdem, wohin uns das jeweilige Angebot eines
Reisebueros bringt: nach Atlanta, Barcelona oder Sydney.  Wir koennen
uns sogar die besten Trainer der Welt fuer eine Trainingseinheit oder
eine ganze Fitnesswoche leisten.  Tatsachen spielen, wie ueberall, kaum
noch eine Rolle; was zaehlt, ist das Image.  Im Mittelpunkt des
Schulsports stehen nicht mehr Autoritaet und Selbstdisziplin, sondern
die freie Wahl zwischen zahlreichen Sportarten und eine allgemein
verbreitete Laessigkeit und Genusssucht, die bisweilen die ganze Welt
als ein einziges grosses Sportereignis erscheinen laesst.  Der Sport
wird von vielen Anliegen und Interessensgruppen vereinnahmt.  Auf der
Buehne der sportlichen Grossereignisse konkurrieren die groessten Firmen
der Welt mit feministischen und Menschenrechtsorganisationen, mit
AIDS-Hilfe- und Behindertengruppen um die Aufmerksamkeit und das Geld
der Zuschauer.  Sponsoring ist sehr waehlerisch und steht oft genug im
krassen Gegensatz zu den Werbeslogans, die es verbreitet.  Diese
Formen des indirekten Wetteinsatzes haben den riesigen Markt der
Unterhaltungsindustrie im Auge, innerhalb dessen die
Interessensgebiete abgesteckt werden.

Der Wetteinsatz erfolgt ueber Produktwerbung auf Kleidung und Banden,
allgemeine Werbemassnahmen und durch OEffentlichkeitsarbeit.  Bei der
Olympiade in Atlanta wurden eine halbe Million Markennamen vermarktet.
Allein ihre Auflistung und Verwaltung erforderte einen ungeheuren
Aufwand, der mit "Wahrung des Olympischen Gedankens und der Rechte
der offiziellen Sponsoren" begruendet wurde.  Jeder Quadratzentimeter
am Koerper eines Sportlers wird vermarktet.  Je besser der Manager
(nicht unbedingt die sportliche Leistung), desto hoeher der
Werbevertrag.  Detailaufnahmen von hoechster Schaerfe bringen den
Herstellernamen einer Armbanduhr aufs Bild, ein Firmenlogo auf den
Socken, Hemden und Stirnbaendern den Getraenkelieferanten oder den
Schnee- und Eisproduzenten der Olympischen Winterspiele.  Der
Wettkampf in der Arena und der Wettkampf um die sportlichen
Werbetraeger naehren sich gegenseitig.

In der Tat ist die Welt ein Dorf, und zwar eines, das dem Ergebnis
geringere Bedeutung beimisst als den neuesten Werbespots.  Die
Botschaft ist dabei verlorengegangen.  Der Sportschuh ist die
Botschaft oder irgend etwas anderes, was den kurzen Triumphzug in der
Welt des Konsums antritt.  Ist dieser Triumph erreicht, halten
wahnwitzige Handelsaktivitaeten mit dem Original und dessen
zahlreichen Derivaten und Kopien die Welt zwischen New York und
Sambia, Paris und den Staemmen des tropischen Regenwaldes, Frankfurt
und der hungerleidenden Bevoelkerung Asiens und Afrikas in Atem.  Die
Verfuehrungskraft des Sportmarketing wird allenfalls noch erreicht von
den ebenso ‘illiteraten’ Stars der Unterhaltungsindustrie, die
bisweilen auch fuer den Hunger in der Welt singen, was allerdings ihr
Werbepotential noch erhoeht.

Mit all diesen Erscheinungsformen hat der Sport seinen Bezug zu Natur
und Natuerlichkeit verloren.  Es sieht ganz so aus, als falle der
Sport in sich selbst zusammen, als erlebe er eine Art Implosion, die
Raum freigibt fuer die vielen Geraete, an denen wir daheim unsere
verweichlichten Koerper ertuechtigen.  Radfahren, Rudern, Laufen und
Bergsteigen ueben wir in der kuenstlichen Zurueckgezogenheit unseres
Eigenheims und haben dabei den Blick auf die wenigen gerichtet, die
das alles noch wirklich tun, freilich aus Gruenden, die immer weniger
mit sportlicher Leistungsfreude zu tun haben.  Bald schon werden wir
uns in den Swimming Pools und auf den Abfahrten der virtuellen
Realitaet tummeln, und damit waere dann eine neue Phase in der
Geschichte der Olympischen Spiele eingelaeutet.


Kapitel 3:


Wissenschaft und Philosophie--mehr Fragen als Antworten

In einigen fuehrenden Wissenschaftsbereichen werden
Forschungsergebnisse ausgetauscht, sobald sie vorliegen.  Der
geradezu behaebige Prozess der Drucklegung und des vorausgehenden
Begutachtungssystems wollen nicht so recht in dieses Bild passen.
Auf den Web-Seiten einiger Forschungseinrichtungen tritt an die
Stelle des Begutachtungsverfahrens, das von geriatrischen Hierarchien
beherrscht wird, der direkte Austausch zwischen den wirklichen
Leistungstraegern in der Forschung: Bahnbrechende Hypothesen werden
diskutiert, kritisiert, weiterentwikkelt.  Die Kommunikationsmedien
sind Instrument und zugleich Vermittler vieler Forschungsprojekte.
Bilder, Daten und Simulationen als Teil der Arbeit sind allgemein
zugaenglich und in Formaten verfuegbar, die sofort weiterverarbeitet
oder in technologische Testverfahren ueberfuehrt werden koennen.

Der neue Rahmen wissenschaftlicher Arbeit wirft natuerlich eine Reihe
von Fragen und Problemen auf, von denen nicht zuletzt die des
geistigen Eigentums und der wissenschaftlichen Seriositaet dringend
einer Loesung beduerfen.  Dennoch hat sich das allgemeine Umfeld von
Forschung und Wissensvermittlung nachhaltig geaendert, und die meisten
Wissenschaftler wissen, dass die traditionellen, aus der Schriftkultur
erwachsenen Modelle keine ausreichende Antwort darauf darstellen.  So
schoen die durch die Technologie des Industriezeitalters verkoerperte
Forschung ist, traegt sie doch wenig oder gar nichts zum
wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt in der Nanotechnologie, der
Bioinformatik, der Fluessigkeitsdynamik oder anderen Grenzbereichen
moderner Forschung bei.  Genexpression und Proteinsynthese
sind--gemessen an Arbeitsaufwand und Ergebnissen--Jahrhunderte weiter
als alles, was in der Vergangenheit je erforscht wurde.  Wenn man die
staendig neu entstehenden Wissenschaftsdisziplinen hinzuzaehlt, dann
kann man sich des Eindrucks nicht erwehren, dass die Menschheit sich
jenseits der Schriftkultur neu erfindet.

Der folgende UEberblick vermittelt einen Eindruck vom Umbruch in den
Wissenschaften, vom Gegensatz zwischen den fast schon plumpen
wissenschaftlichen Bemuehungen einer durch Maschinenverarbeitung
gekennzeichneten AEra und der wissenschaftlichen Ebene der atomaren
und subatomaren Reorganisation.

Identische Komponenten koennen in unterschiedlicher Anordnung einmal
als Graphit oder Diamanten, ein anderes Mal als Sand oder Silikon fuer
Chips Gestalt annehmen.  Die Liste dieser Moeglichkeiten verweist auf
eine Wirklichkeit, die unvorstellbare Folgen fuer uns haben wird, die
aber fast taeglich durch eine nicht endende Serie neuer Entdeckung
bestaetigt wird.  Leben auf dem Mars, molekulare Selbstorganisation,
Proteinfaltung, Abbildung mit atomarer Aufloesung, Nanowerkstoffe mit
unvorhersehbaren Eigenschaften, Fortschritte in der Neurologie--diese
Auflistung sieht aus wie eine Sammlung reisserischer Schriftentitel,
spiegelt aber eine Wissenschaftswirklichkeit wider, die bestaendig
durch neue und noch kreativere Untersuchungen weiterentwickelt wird.
Deshalb hat es gar keinen Sinn, das gesamte Spektrum neuer
Forschungsansaetze aufzulisten.  Wir wollen statt dessen die
Gesamtentwicklung unter einem dynamischen Gesichtspunkt verfolgen.
Vor allem moechte ich dabei den Eindruck vermeiden, die Wissenschaft
als die eigentliche Antriebskraft des Umbruchs hinzustellen, als
koennten die ihr zugrundeliegenden Motivationen und Mittel Richtung
und Zweck der Menschheit definieren.


Rationalitaet, Vernunft und die Skala der Dinge

Die aufgewiesene Dynamik des Umbruchs in Wissenschaft und Philosophie
steht im Zusammenhang mit der zugrundeliegenden Struktur jener
Lebenspraxis, die die Abkehr von der Schriftkultur herbeigefuehrt hat.
Beide weisen eine Rationalitaet auf, die die praktischen Erfahrungen
zu ueberzeugenden Schlussfolgerungen (gelegentlich auch logische
Schluesse genannt) und zu Aussagen ueber zukuenftige Ereignisse (in
Natur und Gesellschaft), bis hin zu deren Beeinflussung und Kontrolle
fuehrt.  Rationalitaet haengt insofern mit Effizienz zusammen, als sie
bei der Auswahl der Mittel zur Erreichung bestimmter Zwecke mitwirkt
oder bei der Abwaegung der Voraussetzungen, die zu bestimmten
Handlungsweisen fuehrt.  Rationalitaet ist zielorientiert.  Vernunft
dagegen ist wertorientiert; sie begleitet den Menschen bei der
Entfaltung seiner Identitaet unter dem Gesichtspunkt der
Angemessenheit.  Rationalitaet und Vernunft bedingen sich gegenseitig.
An den Achsen richtig und falsch, gut und schlecht wird menschliches
Handeln und Empfinden in der unter dem Schutz der Schriftkultur
entworfenen Matrix von Leben und Arbeit dargestellt.

Der Prozess, in dem Rationalitaet und Vernunft zu Merkmalen der
menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung werden, ist lang und muehsam.
Menschen, die sich in unterschiedlichen Lebenszusammenhaengen
bestimmen, gehen ein Netz von Abhaengigkeiten und Verbindungen ein.
In einer begrenzten Skala des Daseins finden Vernunft und
Rationalitaet zusammen.  Sie entwickelten sich jedoch bald schon
unabhaengig voneinander, bereits in den fruehen Siedlungs- und
Bewirtschaftungsformen wurde man sich der Unterschiede in den Zielen
und Mitteln beider Prinzipien bewusst, bis dann in der Kulturphase, in
der Werkzeuge und andere Gegenstaende hergestellt wurden, Vernunft und
Rationalitaet getrennte Wege einschlugen.  Mit dem Aufkommen der
Wissenschaften schliesslich gerieten beide nicht selten in Konflikt
miteinander: Manches kann richtig, muss aber nicht gleichzeitig gut
sein.  Es gibt eine Rationalitaet (zielorientiert auf Vermehrung von
Besitz und Vermeidung von Verlust gerichtet), die sich den Anschein
der Vernunft gibt--Handlungen zur Unterstuetzung jener Kraefte, die
Natur und Materie unter Kontrolle bringen.  Parallel zur Wissenschaft
manifestierten sich Magie und Aberglaube--Alchemie, Astrologie,
Zahlenmystik--mit dem Ziel, den sich nach den Massstaeben des Guten
entfaltenden Menschen mit der ihn behausenden Welt zu versoehnen.

In einigen Kulturkreisen foerderte die Rationalitaet einen Hang, die
Natur zu bearbeiten, zu veraendern und letztendlich zu
beherrschen--also: die Natur einem gewuenschten Ordnungsprinzip zu
unterwerfen.  Die Vernunft hingegen suchte nach praktischen
Moeglichkeiten, das Verhaeltnis zwischen Mensch und Natur zu
harmonisieren.

Die Schrift diente beiden.  In ihr wurde Sprache zu einer Gussform fuer
neue Erfahrungen, einem Hort fuer Wissen und einem wirksamen
Instrument zur Evaluation und Selbstevaluation.  Fast alle auf die
Schrift hinfuehrenden menschlichen Leistungen ergaben sich aus den
schriftlichen Formen der Identitaetskonstituierung.  Die
wissenschaftliche Revolution und die Neubestimmung der
Geisteswissenschaften (besonders der Philosophie) im 16. und 17.
Jahrhundert sind fest in der Lebenspraxis verwurzelt, die notwendig
zur Schrift hinfuehrte.  Diese Entwicklung wird ueblicherweise mit drei
Errungenschaften verknuepft:
1. der Entstehung eines neuen Weltbildes, das sich wissenschaftlich
in der heliozentrischen Astronomie und philosophisch als radikal
veraendertes, diesseitsorientiertes Menschenbild aeusserte;
2. der mathematischen Beschreibung von Bewegung;
3. einer neuen Begrifflichkeit fuer die Mechanik.


Die in diesen Leistungen zutage tretende naturwissenschaftliche und
humanistische Erneuerung gab den eigentlichen Anschub fuer die
industrielle Revolution.  Der Wandel von der Agrarwirtschaft als
Ausdruck einer relativ begrenzten Bevoelkerungs- und Arbeitsskala zu
industrieller Produktion erhoehte die Effizienz in einer Groessenordnung,
die die in jener Zeit erreichte kritische Masse der
Menschheitsentwicklung widerspiegelt.


Die verlorene Balance

In der Industriegesellschaft lief die Naturwissenschaft der
Philosophie den Rang ab.  Aus einer urspruenglich sehr elitaeren, von
den Huetern der Schriftkultur (der Religion) kontrollierten Taetigkeit
wurde ein fest in der Gesellschaft verwurzeltes Denk- und
Arbeitsprinzip.  Die Philosophie nahm eine gegenteilige Entwicklung;
sie opferte ihren Status als allgemeine Instanz des Fragens und der
wissenschaftlichen Neugier und wurde zum Privileg einiger weniger,
die sich die geistige Anschauung der Welt leisten konnten.  Die
Rationalitaet der Naturwissenschaften fand eine allgemeine Umsetzung
in Technik und Technologie und erreichte mit
Nahrungsmittelverarbeitung und Massenproduktion von Nahrung, mit den
modernen Transportmitteln (Auto und Flugzeug), dem allgemeinen
Wohnungsbau und der Verwendung von Strom als effizienter
Energiequelle ihren Hoehepunkt.

Einstein hat eine gewagte Hypothese aufgestellt: "Die Tragoedie des
modernen Menschen liegt darin, dass er Existenzbedingungen geschaffen
hat, fuer die er selbst nach seiner phylogenetischen Entwicklung gar
nicht geeignet ist."  Die verlorene Balance zwischen Rationalitaet und
Vernunft zeigt sich am deutlichsten in all den Folgen der
Industriellen Revolution, die zum zuegellosen Kapitalismus des 19. und
20. Jahrhunderts gefuehrt haben.  Erschoepfender Abbau von
Rohmaterialien, Luft- und Wasserverschmutzung, Erosion von
fruchtbarem Acker- und Weideland und geistige und koerperliche
Belastung des Menschen gehoeren zu den unmittelbaren Auswirkungen
dieses Ungleichgewichts.

Diese Folgen allein wuerden indes nicht ausreichen, um die
Vorherrschaft der Schriftkultur in der Wissenschaft in Frage zu
stellen.  Die eigentliche Infragestellung erfolgt durch die neue
Skala der Menschheit, fuer die sich das Modell der industriellen
Revolution und der Schriftkultur als unzureichend erwiesen hat.  Die
Effizienzerwartungen in ganz neuen Groessenordnungen erfordern eine
ganz neue Dynamik, neue Vermittlungsformen und -instanzen und damit
verbundene Prinzipien der Nicht-Linearitaet, der Vagheit und
Nicht-Determiniertheit.  Die Naturwissenschaft und deren Formen der
philosophischen Selbstreflexion haben schon heute Wissensbereiche
erschlossen, die jenseits der von der Schriftkultur gezogenen Grenze
liegen.  Die fruehen Erfolge in der Mikrophysik fuehrten zur
Entwicklung relativ rudimentaerer Waffensysteme: als Antwort auf die
erste substantielle technologische Herausforderung
nicht-schriftkultureller Art.  Mittlerweile ist deutlich geworden,
dass wir eine neue Physik, eine neue Chemie und viele andere, erst
jenseits der Schriftkultur konstituierte Wissenschaftsdisziplinen mit
systemischem Fokus benoetigen.  Die erwaehnten Wissenschaftsbereiche
deuten bereits an, wie und in welche Richtung sich die
Naturwissenschaften entwickeln werden; zugleich lassen sie eine neue
Epistemologie erkennen, die neue Erklaerungsmodelle der Welt
hervorbringt und auf ihre Angemessenheit und Kohaerenz ueberprueft.  Fuer
die wissenschaftliche Praxis spielen dabei kognitive Ressourcen, die
nicht mehr durch das empirische Prinzip der Beobachtung eingeschraenkt
sind, eine besondere Rolle.  Epistemologisch zweifelsfrei ist dabei
die Tatsache, dass nahezu alle neuen Wissenschaftsformen ein Interesse
am Lebendigen zeigen.  Bei diesen neuen Wissenschaften, die allesamt
auch philosophische Implikationen aufweisen, handelt es sich um
computationale Biophysik, Biochemie, Molekularbiologie, Genetik,
Medizin und um die Erforschung der Mikro- und Nanowelt.

Die Schriftkultur mit ihren strukturalen Merkmalen ist fuer diese
neuen Erfahrungen weder die geeignete Form noch der geeignete
Wissensspeicher oder auch nur ein effizientes Evaluationsinstrument.
Als eine unter vielen anderen Alphabetismen behaelt sie ihren Bereich,
fuer den sie angemessen ist und in dem sie die an sie gerichteten
Effizienzerwartungen erfuellt.  Der in der Ausdifferenzierung in viele
Alphabetismen zum Ausdruck kommende Umbruch vollzieht sich als
Konflikt zwischen Mitteln von nur begrenzter Effizienz und neuen
Mitteln, die den Problemen enorm gestiegener Bevoelkerungszahlen und
dem neuen Anspruch auf Wohlstand und sogar UEberfluss eher gerecht
werden.  Aus fast allen neuen Wissenschaftsdisziplinen entwickeln
sich neue Technologien.  Einige davon kennen wir bereits: Wir wissen,
dass Taschenrechner, hitze- und kaeltebestaendige Gewebe und neue
Werkstoffe zu erschwinglichen Preisen die Nebenprodukte grosser
wissenschaftlicher Projekte (Raumforschung, Genforschung, Biophysik)
sind.  An andere beginnen wir uns zu gewoehnen: intelligente Stoffe,
die ihre Struktur selbstaendig veraendern koennen, und
selbstorganisierende Stoffe.


Gedanken ueber das Denken

Nach weit verbreiteter Auffassung ist--wie weiter oben schon
ausgefuehrt--das Denken an die Sprache gebunden, also ist die Sprache
das Medium des Denkens.  Andere (und hier beruft man sich immer
wieder auf Einstein) behaupten demgegenueber, ihr Denken wuerde sich in
Bildern, Geraeuschen oder einer Mischung aus verschiedenen
Sinneseindruecken vollziehen.  Bis heute ist ungeklaert, ob dies eine
metaphorische Umschreibung oder eine Tatsache ist.  Das gleiche gilt
aber auch fuer die Sprache.  Dass wir unsere Gedanken sprachlich
ausdruekken, und zwar durchaus mit Muehen und meist ungenuegend, muss
nicht heissen, dass wir nur in der Sprache denken.  Die Tatsache, dass
die Sprache ein Medium der Erklaerung und Interpretation ist,
Schlussfolgerungen, Ableitungen und gelegentlich hypothetisches Denken
(sogenannte Abduktionen) ermoeglicht, ist kein Beleg dafuer, dass sie
das einzige Medium dafuer ist.  Naturwissenschaftler denken in der
Sprache mathematischer oder logischer Formeln oder in neueren
Programmiersprachen, ohne sie deshalb zur alltaeglichen Verstaendigung
oder fuer Gedichte oder Liebesbriefe zu verwenden.

Die Schriftkultur gruendet den Primat der allgemeinen Bildung auf die
UEberzeugung, dass das Denken sprachlicher Natur sei.  Dementsprechend
ist eine gute Sprachbeherrschung, wie sie in den Regeln der
Schriftkultur kodifiziert ist, Voraussetzung fuer erfolgreiches Denken.
Abgesehen davon, dass dies ein Zirkelschluss ist, der die
Voraussetzung zum Ergebnis macht, haetten Wissenschaft und Philosophie
dieser kuehnen Annahme so manches entgegenzusetzen.  Sie ist niemals
bewiesen worden, und angesichts der Verbindungen zwischen allen
Zeichen, die am Denkprozess beteiligt sind, ist sie wohl auch nicht zu
beweisen.  Bilder lassen Woerter assoziieren, aber andere
Sinneseindruecke tun dies auch.  Worte wiederum rufen Bilder, Musik
und aehnliches hervor.  Die integrative Natur des Denkens ist
vermutlich durch freiwillige Entscheidungsmechanismen oder durch
genetische Mechanismen bestimmt, die so strukturiert sind, dass sie
ein bestimmtes Zeichensystem (Sprache, die Formelsprache der
Mathematik, Diagramme) als vorherrschend anerkennen, ohne dabei
Denkweisen auszuschliessen, die nicht auf diesen Voraussetzungen
beruhen.

Das Verstaendnis von Denken als sprachlichem Denken hat zu bestimmten
Formen der Lebenspraxis gefuehrt, die nur unter dieser Voraussetzung
entstehen konnten.  Wir koennen Denken aber auch anders definieren,
was wiederum zu anderen notwendigen und nuetzlichen Denkweisen fuehren
kann oder bereits gefuehrt hat.  In diesem Zusammenhang stellt sich
besonders eine Frage: Muessen wir denkende Maschinen--d. h.  Programme,
die vollkommen autonom solche Operationen durchfuehren, die wir
ueblicherweise mit menschlichem Denken verbinden--deshalb von der
Diskussion ausnehmen, weil sie keine schriftkulturelle Bildung
besitzen?  Viele wissenschaftliche Versuche waeren unter solchen
Voraussetzungen gar nicht erst auf den Weg gebracht worden, dazu
gehoeren vor allem die vielen neuen Entwicklungen von intelligenten,
selbstregenerierenden Werkstoffen.  Diese wissenschaftlichen
Disziplinen, die auf ungewohnten Denk- und Arbeitsweisen beruhen,
welche relativ unabhaengig von Sprache, Bildung und Schriftkultur
funktionieren, haben zu anderen, komplementaeren Definitionen von
Denken und Rationalitaet gefuehrt.  Indem man Denken mit anderen
menschlichen Regungen--mit Emotionen, Humor, AEsthetik oder der
Faehigkeit, Gedanken durch verschiedene Medien, Sinne oder Sprachen zu
projizieren--zusammen sieht, wird man vermutlich zu noch kuehneren
wissenschaftlichen Ansaetzen und Fragestellungen gelangen.

Bevor wir uns diesen anderen Definitionen des Denkens und des
Verhaeltnisses von Rationalitaet und Vernunft zuwenden, wollen wir
einige Merkmale des zeitgenoessischen Denkens, besonders in
Wissenschaft und Philosophie betrachten.  Im Vergleich zu vergangenen
Lebensumstaenden ist der Anteil der Sprache im Arbeits- und
gesellschaftlichen Leben zurueckgegangen.  Wenn sich unser Denken nur
in der Sprache vollziehen wuerde, hiesse das, dass auch der Anteil des
Denkens abgenommen hat.  Nur wenige wuerden dieser These zustimmen.
Der Rest an Sprache, der in unserem Zusammenleben und im beruflichen
Miteinander geblieben ist, bringt lediglich die Segmentierung unseres
Lebens und unserer Interaktionsformen zum Ausdruck.  Dieser Rest an
Sprache, dessen Beherrschung eine weitere Bildung oder
schriftkulturelle Fertigkeit voraussetzt, besteht aus
gesellschaftlichen Allgemeinplaetzen und eignet sich in keiner Weise
als Medium fuer das Denken.  Parallel zu der abnehmenden Bedeutung der
natuerlichen Sprache gewannen die Sprachen der Wissenschaft und
Technologie in dem Masse an Vielfalt und Bedeutung, in dem die
Erwartungen an wissenschaftliche und technologische Effizienz stiegen.
Im begrenzten Umfeld der natuerlichen Sprachverwendung wurden die
Ausdruecke, die die Menschen fuer das alltaegliche Funktionieren
benoetigen, ohne Ruecksicht auf die Beduerfnisse nach Vielfalt und
Veraenderung in unseren gegenseitigen Beziehungen hervorgebracht.  Es
sind weitgehend Sprachkonserven mit begrenzter Funktion, die aus
vorangegangenen Situationen ungeachtet der sie hervorbringenden
Umstaende uebernommen wurden.  Es ist sehr wahrscheinlich, dass ein
schriftunkundiger, ja analphabetischer Nachbar niemals auffallen
wuerde; denn alles, worin er uns gegenuebertritt, kommt ohne Bildung
und weitgehend ohne Schrift aus: Autofahren, Waeschewaschen, Kochen,
Bankgeschaefte, Telefonieren, Fernsehen, Einbindung in das Internet.
Mit ein wenig UEbung kann man all diesen Taetigkeiten nachgehen, ohne
durch ein Bildungshandicap oder gar durch Analphabetismus aufzufallen.
Die neuen Geraete, die neuen Stoffe, die neuen Nahrungsmittel und
Arzneien, die eher im Grenzgebiet der Wissenschaft als in unserem
Lebens- und Arbeitsmittelpunkt angesiedelt sind, werden die
Moeglichkeiten von und den Bedarf an Zivilisationsformen, die von mehr
als einer Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsform gelenkt sind, noch
erhoehen.

In einer Welt, in der hochspezialisierte Taetigkeiten vorherrschen,
fuehren auch Ungebildete oder Analphabeten im Sinne der Schriftkultur
ein unbemerktes und reibungsloses Dasein, ohne ihr eigenes Leben oder
die Effizienz des Systems zu beeintraechtigen.  Auch hat sich ihre
Rolle veraendert.  Denn auch eine analphabetische Rationalitaet ist
zielorientiert, sie drueckt sich lediglich mit anderen Mitteln aus.
Auch sie formuliert Aussagen ueber das zukuenftige Verhalten von
Systemen, die von hochspezialisierten, extrem funktionsorientierten
Sprachen betrieben werden und deren Betrieb nicht von der Bildung
ihres Betreibers abhaengt.  Wissenschaftliche Bildung ist entweder in
Faehigkeiten zu lokalisieren, die man durch Ausbildung und Einuebung
erwerben kann, oder aber in die Systeme eingebaut, die von Menschen
betrieben werden, die weniger ueber deren Funktionsweisen wissen als
die Maschinen selbst.

Falscher Sprachgebrauch, nachlaessige Formulierungen und fehlerhafte
Grammatik, Alltagsfloskeln und die Unfaehigkeit oder der Unwille, ein
Gespraech zu fuehren, sagen noch immer etwas ueber das Denken aus, wenn
auch vielleicht etwas anderes, Unerwartetes: z. B., dass Denkformen,
die auf nichtsprachlichen Zeichensystemen beruhen, effektiver und
hinsichtlich der vor uns liegenden Probleme zeitgemaesser sind;
vielleicht auch, dass sich das, was sich in einem Zeichensystem als
angemessen und effektiv erweist, nicht mit dem gleichen Ergebnis in
einen anderen lebenspraktischen Zusammenhang uebertragen laesst.  Die
Naturwissenschaften jedenfalls versuchen sich weitgehend von den
Ungenauigkeiten, Mehrdeutigkeiten und stereotypisierenden Floskeln
der Sprache zu befreien; im grossen und ganzen trifft dies auch fuer
die moderne Philosophie zu, obwohl ihr keine vergleichbaren
Alternativen zur Verfuegung stehen.  Die Aufgabe der
Naturwissenschaften und in eingeschraenkterem Masse auch der
Philosophie liegt heute darin, Sprache(n) zu finden, die Phaenomene
wie Kontinuitaet, Vagheit und Unbestimmtheitsrelationen behandeln
koennen.

Die hochspezialisierten Lebensformen basieren nicht mehr vornehmlich
auf individuellem Wissen, sondern auf Individuen, die sich als
Informationsschnittpunkte, bzw.  Knoten, verstehen.  Wenn die
Notwendigkeit zu individuellem, selbstaendigem Denken abnimmt, dann
entspricht dies der extremen Segmentierung unserer Arbeitswelt und
dem Umstand, dass die aus dieser segmentierten Arbeit hervorgegangenen
Teilbeitraege technologisch erfolgreich zusammengefuehrt werden koennten.
Fuer unser Privatleben und alles, was wir fuer unseren
Lebensunterhalt tun (Ernaehrung, Erholung, Unterhaltung), gilt das
Gleiche.  Unser Denken beschraenkt sich auf das Auswaehlen: aus
vorgefertigten Menues, aus Konfektionsware, aus Fertigbauteilen, aus
Waschprogrammen.  Aber die Gegenstaende unseres taeglichen Gebrauchs
verkoerpern die Intelligenz eines anderen.  Das verdinglichte Denken,
das in die Genmanipulation, in Materialien und Maschinen eingegangen
ist, schraenkt das originale, tatsaechliche Denken des einzelnen ein.
Der heutige Mensch bindet sich in das Informationsnetzwerk ein und
verbringt den weitaus groessten Teil seines Lebens damit, Informationen
zu verarbeiten: Anweisungen fuer Taetigkeiten, die das gewuenschte
Ergebnis zeitigen.  Man koennte sagen, die Menschen verlassen sich auf
lebendige Maschinen, die sich dem Benutzer anpassen, sich
eigenstaendig auf veraenderte Bedingungen umstellen und sich selbst
reparieren.  Rationalitaet ist zunehmend in diese Technologie
integriert und damit aus dem Prozess der individuellen
Selbstkonstituierung wegrationalisiert.  Die Folgen koennen immens
sein, aber sie werden gefaehrlicher, je weniger wir ueber sie
nachdenken oder uns ihrer bewusst sind.

Vergangenheit und Gegenwart haben auf dieser Ebene der Technologie
keine gegenseitige Anbindung mehr.  Der einzelne braucht nicht mehr
zu denken, muss sich in dieses Programm, das eine Rationalitaet mit
allerhoechster Effizienz und Vernunft verkoerpert, einfuegen.  Niemand
braucht mehr zu wissen, wie die Dinge unseres alltaeglichen Lebens
hergestellt werden und wodurch ihre Qualitaet garantiert ist.  Nicht
der Prozess der Herstellung ist wichtig, sondern allein das Ergebnis.
Effizienz ist vorrangig gegenueber individuellem Know-how.  Das Denken
ist dem Denken entfremdet in dem Sinne, dass jegliches Denken, also
jegliche Rationalitaet, ausserhalb der Selbstkonstituierung des
einzelnen liegt.  Es scheint, als fuehren dieses veraeusserte Denken und
diese veraeusserte Rationalitaet ein Eigenleben.  Memetische Mechanismen
belegen diesen Prozess.

In diesem unserem Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur ziehen wir nicht
nur aus der erhoehten Effizienz unseren Nutzen, wir erleben auch, wie
das neue pragmatische Instrumentarium eigene, sich selbst erneuernde
Antriebskraefte entwickelt.  Es scheint bisweilen so, als wuerden nicht
die Menschen um erhoehte Kreativitaet und Produktivitaet ringen, sondern
als wuerden sich Wohlstand und UEberfluss als gegebene Groessen in unserem
Leben um die Erfuellung der Effizienzerwartungen in unserer global
angelegten Skala kuemmern.  Mit der technologischen Entwicklung und
wissenschaftlichen Erneuerung Schritt zu halten, wird zum Selbstzweck,
der irgendwie von menschlicher Vernunft abgekoppelt wurde.  Die
verwirrende Rationalitaet unbegrenzter Wahlmoeglichkeit geht einher mit
der Erkenntnis, dass Wertoptionen vollends verschwunden sind und kein
Raum mehr bleibt fuer vernunftgelenktes Nachdenken.  In der Folge
werden die sozialen und politischen Aspekte des Daseins
kurzgeschlossen, besonders diejenigen, die den Status von
Wissenschaft und Philosophie betreffen.  Wissenschaftliche Forschung
wird oft daraufhin befragt, ob ihre Ziele ueberhaupt sinnvoll sind.
Noch vor 15 Jahren war die Haelfte der Amerikaner der Meinung, dass
Wissenschaft und Technik die vielfaeltigen Probleme der Gesellschaft
nicht nur nicht loesen koennen, sondern dafuer verantwortlich sind.  Die
Balance ist verloren gegangen, aber die Denkhaltungen derer, die den
Zielen und Werten der Schriftkultur verpflichtet bleiben, haben sich
deshalb nicht geaendert.  Sie widersetzen sich den Natur- und
Geisteswissenschaften, statt sie als notwendige, wenn auch in sich
widerspruechliche Einheiten aufzufassen.  Und in Europa, wo man den
Entwicklungen in den neuen Wissenschaften eher hinterherlaeuft, zeigt
man sich noch zurueckhaltender.  Skepsis ist gesund und notwendig,
aber sie hat auch ihren Preis.


Quo vadis, Wissenschaft?

Entdeckung und Erklaerung sind die beiden Ebenen, auf denen das
Verhaeltnis von Sprache und Wissenschaft relevant wird.  Wir sollten
vorausschicken, dass Schriftkultur und Schriftlichkeit niemals als
Mittel wissenschaftlicher Forschung und auch Sprache nicht als
Werkzeug fuer Entdeckungen angesehen wurden.  Man behauptete lediglich,
dass die Sprache den ersten Zugang zur Wissenschaft und damit das
Fortfuehren wissenschaftlicher Arbeit im wesentlichen ermoeglicht.
Diese Behauptung traf in der Vergangenheit auch zu, solange sich
wissenschaftliches Arbeiten im homogenen kognitiven Umfeld
allgemeingueltiger Raum- und Zeitdarstellungen abspielte.  Mit der
Veraenderung dieses Umfelds stand dessen Ratio neuen Entdeckungen und
den Erklaerungen bereits gefundener Entdeckungen im Wege.  Neben
vielen anderen Codes greift die Wissenschaft heute vornehmlich auf
symbolisches Denken zurueck, wie es in Mathematik, Logik, Genetik,
Informatik usw. verbreitet ist.  Wissenschaft als zentralistisch
organisierte Institution macht heute neuen wissenschaftlichen
Arbeitsweisen Platz, die oft voellig unabhaengig voneinander existieren
und so der Skala des jeweiligen Interessensphaenomens gerechter werden.
Diese Unabhaengigkeit und das Gespuer fuer die veraenderte Skala ergibt
sich aus den unterschiedlichen Forschungsgegenstaenden der
Spezialdisziplinen, aus unterschiedlichen Forschungsperspektiven und
Fragestellungen sowie aus unterschiedlichen Zeichensystemen, die als
effizientes Forschungsinstrument oder aber als Medium fuer effiziente
Erklaerungsmodelle bereitstehen.

Platon hatte bekanntlich ausreichende mathematische Kenntnisse als
die Voraussetzung fuer die Zulassung zur Akademie erklaert.  Heute
wuerden die Hueter der Wissenschaften Logik, bzw. die Beherrschung von
kuenstlichen Sprachen wie etwa Programmiersprachen, fordern, wobei
diese ja selbst wiederum staendig optimiert, differenziert und durch
Erwartung einer erhoehten computationalen Effizienz veraendert werden.
Zur Zeit des "Redners" Sokrates galt die Sprache als Grundlage und
Konstituens von Staedten, Gesetzen und Kuensten.  Zur Zeit des
roemischen Dichters Lukrez wurde Physik in Versen abgefasst (7000
Hexameter legten die epikureische Atomtheorie dar).  Galilei
bevorzugte den Dialog in seiner italienischen Umgangssprache, damit
seine Zeitgenossen die Entdeckungen der Physik und Astronomie
verstehen konnten.  Bei Newton wurde die Sprache durch Formeln und
Gleichungen ersetzt, die seitdem das Vokabular der Physik ausmachten.
AEhnliche Entwicklungen koennen wir in den Wissenschaftsgeschichten
Chinas, Indiens oder des Nahen Osten verfolgen.  Wenn also heute neue
visuelle oder multimediale Sprachen entwickelt werden, dann
entspricht dies unserer veraenderten, auf eben diesen Phaenomenen
beruhenden Lebenspraxis.  Sie fuehren zu noch mehr Arbeitsteilung,
Vermittlung und neuen Interaktionsformen; sie fuehren hin zu einer
Lebenspraxis, die eher intensional als extensional ist.


Raum und Zeit: befreite Geiseln

Die enzyklopaedische Tradition erhob den wissenschaftlich taetigen
Menschen (l’homme scientifique) zum Mittelpunkt und definierte ihn
durch Sprache.  In dieser Tradition vollzog sich eine ganze Serie von
fortschreitenden Veraenderungen der wissenschaftlichen Praxis.  Wir
koennen sie an der Sprache ablesen, in der sie ausgedrueckt wurden.
Das synkretistische Stadium des Menschen war durch Beobachtung und
kurze Zyklen von Aktion und Reaktion gekennzeichnet.  Die fruehen
Formen wissenschaftlichen Denkens waren noch nicht von der
praktischen Entfaltung des Menschen in der Welt abgekoppelt.  Bilder
und spaeter Benennungen von Pflanzen, Tieren, Bergen und Fluessen
gehoeren in diese Zeit.  Erst als sich das Beobachten zu einem
dauerhaften Selbstzweck verselbstaendigte, wurde aus der
wissenschaftlichen Taetigkeit eine eigenstaendige Praxis.

Die Wissenschaft entstand zusammen mit dem magischen Denken und
setzte ihre weitere Entwicklung auch in dieser Symbiose fort, bis sie
sich schliesslich gemeinsam mit der Religion dem Magischen entzog und
widersetzte.  Beobachten und Furcht vor dem Beobachteten waren lange
eins.  Die Bezeichnungen der Sterne geben Aufschluss ueber die
Veraenderungen in der Sprache, in der die Astronomie sich ausdrueckte.
Nur wenig wusste man offenbar in jener Zeit ueber die Mechanik des
Kosmos.  Mythische Bezeichnungen wurden durch die Tierkreiszeichen
magischen Ursprungs ersetzt (jeweils mit Bezug zu den praktischen
Taetigkeiten des Menschen im Jahreszeitenwechsel), spaeter auch durch
die christlichen Taufnamen und heute durch die detaillierten
numerischen Auflistungen von Positionen, Bewegung und Beziehungen.

In die Beobachtung der Himmelskoerper, aus der sich ein Gefuehl fuer
Dauer und Zeit (wie lange braucht ein bestimmter Planet fuer die
Veraenderung seiner Position?) einstellte, brachte der Mensch seine
spezifischen biologischen und kognitiven Merkmale ein: Sehen,
Assoziieren, Vergleichen.  Beobachtungen und Benennungen bezogen sich
auf Positionen und auf Lichtintensitaet.  Mit der sich allmaehlich
einstellenden Zeitvorstellung verloren die Himmelskoerper ihre Bindung
an die Goetter.  Auch zu Zeiten eingeschraenkter wissenschaftlicher
Aktivitaet (Europa zwischen dem 5. und 10. Jahrhundert) wurden
Planeten beobachtet, Himmelskarten mit verschiedenen Konstellationen
gezeichnet und die Grundlagen fuer spaetere Fortschritte in der
Astronomie gelegt.  Physikalische Eigenschaften wie Licht, Farbe und
Klarheit fuehrten zu praeziseren Bezeichnungen; die Identifikation von
Sternen wurde in manchen Lebenszusammenhaengen (vor allem der
Seefahrt) von entscheidender Bedeutung fuer erfolgreiches Handeln.

Magie und Wissenschaften ermoeglichten indes unterschiedliche
Erklaerungen fuer Erfolg.  Zu jener Zeit wurden die Sterne anhand von
Merkmalen identifiziert, die jedem, der sie benoetigte, offenkundig
waren.  Die magische Dimension ergab sich aus den Assoziationen
zwischen den Eigenschaften bestimmter Personen und dem Verhalten
bestimmter Planeten, d. h. aus dem abgeleiteten Einfluss, den die
Himmelskoerper auf fuer den Menschen entscheidende Ereignisse ausuebten.
In diesem gesamten Zusammenhang wirkte die Sprache als Werkzeug fuer
Integration und Beobachtung und als Mittel fuer die damals gueltige
logische Praxis, z. B. fuer Deduktion.  Die Sprache formte die
Erfahrung und Auffassung von Zeit, speicherte das erworbene Wissen
und wurde auf diese Weise zu einem entscheidenden Medium fuer die
Selbstentfaltung des Menschen in der Zeit.  Die Rolle der Sprache
wurde durch die Schriftkultur gefestigt, die die in der Sprache
gefundenen Erkenntnisse verallgemeinerte, wodurch wiederum effektive
Mittel zur Strukturierung neuer Erwartungen geschaffen waren.  Erst
als zeitabhaengige praktische Erfordernisse wie die Relativitaet, denen
mit schriftkulturellen Mitteln nicht mehr begegnet werden konnte,
einen kritischen Punkt erreichten, wurde die Zeiterfahrung aus den
Fesseln der Verbalsprache befreit.

Ein enormer kognitiver Schritt war noetig, um von der Unmittelbarkeit
der persoenlichen Umgebung zur abstrakten Raumvorstellung zu gelangen.
Die Geometrie--woertlich: Landvermessung--verbindet die sich konkret
stellenden Aufgaben (Landvermessung, Hausbau, Ausbau, Beobachtung der
Himmelskoerper) mit der Verallgemeinerung von Entfernung.  Die
Vermessung des Landes fuehrt nicht nur zu dessen Beschreibung, sondern
auch zu dessen Neuschaffung in der abstrakten Kategorie des Raumes.
Die Sprache spielte bei all dem eine entscheidende Rolle.  Zunaechst
blieben die geometrischen Konventionen eng auf die praktischen
Implikationen bezogen.  Sobald allgemeinere Raumerfahrungen jenseits
der unmittelbaren Raumbeziehungen durch Seefahrt, Siedlungsformen,
Strategien der Landesverteidigung usw. moeglich wurden, veraenderte
sich die Sprache der Geometrie.  Bedingt durch weitere Entwicklungen
der Lebenspraxis und durch eigene, inhaerente Antriebe bildeten sich
schliesslich zahlreiche geometrische Sprachen heraus.

Die Sprachen, die die Grundlagen der Geometrie, der algebraischen
Geometrie, der Topologie und der Differentialgeometrie bilden, sind
so verschieden wie die Erfahrungen, aus denen sie abgeleitet wurden.
Oft reicht die schriftkulturelle Sprache aus, um geometrische
Probleme zu formulieren, sie versagt aber bei der Loesung dieser
Probleme.  Der intuitive visuelle Charakter der Geometrie ist
offensichtlich besser als die Schrift geeignet, Phaenomene der
Symmetrie, vieldimensionale Raeume und Konvexitaet zu erfassen.  Starre
und elastische Raeume verhalten sich anders als Raeume, die durch
Sprache beschrieben werden.  Die Bezuege der geometrischen Notationen
sind in aller Regel sehr abstrakt.  Dadurch, dass Raum und Zeit von
der Sprache losgeloest wurden, haben sich Rationalitaet, in der die
wissenschaftliche Praxis begruendet ist, und Vernunft, in der die
Philosophie ihren Ursprung hat, nachhaltig veraendert.


Kohaerenz und Diversitaet

Wissenschaft fuehrt die Ergebnisse diversifizierter Erfahrungen
zusammen und verleiht dem menschlichen Beduerfnis nach einem
zusammenhaengenden Blick auf das Ganze gebuehrenden Ausdruck.  Wir
haben allerdings zeigen koennen, dass sich globale Zusammenhaenge, wie
sie in der Sprache formuliert sind, und spezialisiertes Wissen nicht
unbedingt vereinbaren lassen.  Dementsprechend haben die
Wissenschaftler den Versuch, den allgemeinen (sprachlichen) Rahmen
mit dem spezialisierten (wissenschaftlichen) Blickwinkel in Einklang
zu bringen, aufgegeben.  Die Einsicht, dass die Wissenschaftssprache
nicht nur ein Beschreibungsinstrument ist, sondern ein formender
Faktor der wissenschaftlichen Arbeit, hat sich nur muehsam durchsetzen
koennen, zumal die Sprache ihre Darstellungsmechanismen fuer unser
Raum- und Zeitempfinden bereithielt.  Es war offenbar weniger
schwierig zu erkennen, wie die Art des Messens von bestimmten
Phaenomenen (besonders in der Physik) das beobachtete System
veraenderte, als zu verstehen, wie eine sprachlich formulierte
Hypothese den Rahmen fuer eine subjektive Wissenschaft abgab.  Die
Subjektivitaet sprachlicher Beschreibung entspricht einer spezifischen
Erfahrung, naemlich derjenigen, in der wir Dinge durch Sprache
identifizieren.

Bestimmte Entwicklungen in den Wissenschaften sind nicht fuer alle
Wissenschaftszweige identisch.  So entwickelten sich Astronomie und
Geometrie unterschiedlich und auch jeweils anders als andere
wissenschaftliche Disziplinen.  Der Konflikt zwischen den Zielen und
den Mitteln der Wissenschaft fuehrte dazu, dass sich die Wissenschaft
allmaehlich von der Sprache befreite.  Damit aber wurden neue Sprachen
notwendig.  Das Aufbrechen der Sprachbarrieren und die damit
einhergehende Emanzipation von der Schriftkultur stellt schon in sich
eine praktische Erfahrung eigener Art dar.  Zwei Aspekte der Sprache
werden dabei neu ueberdacht: der epistemologische und der
kommunikative.  Unter dem epistemologischen Status ueberpruefen wir,
inwiefern die Sprache als Medium der Wissenschaft und bei der
Herausformung der Perspektive wissenschaftlicher Fragestellungen
fungiert.  Der kommunikative Status bezieht sich auf ihre Leistung
bei der Verbreitung gemeinsamen Wissens.  Die Ebenen der
Fragestellung, Ergebnisformulierung, Interpretation, des
Experimentierens und Evaluierens sowie der Mitteilung und Verbreitung
sind dabei verschieden.  Sie werden sich noch weiter auseinander
entwickeln.  Die der neuen Wissenschaft eigene Rationalitaet laesst sich
nicht mehr darauf beschraenken, der techne einen logos beizugeben.
Das Erbe Francis Bacons, des weitsichtigen Theoretikers der
experimentellen Wissenschaften, und Descartes, dessen
Verstehensgesetze die schriftkulturelle Phase des wissenschaftlichen
Denkens beherrschten, hat sich daher in dem Augenblick erschoepft, in
dem wir die beherrschende Rolle einer einzigen Sprache zugunsten
einer Pluralitaet vieler (Sonder-) Sprachen aufgegeben haben und von
der Schriftkultur in ein Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur
eingetreten sind.


Computationale Wissenschaft

Die Sprache ist mehrdeutig, ungenau und in bezug zu den beobachteten
und erklaerten Phaenomenen nicht neutral.  Aus diesem Grund musste die
Informationswissenschaft Sondersprachen konstruieren, die die
Ambiguitaet der natuerlichen Sprachen vermeiden und die hohe Effizienz
automatischer Verarbeitung ermoeglichen.  Viele formale Sprachen sind
die neuen wissenschaftlichen Laboratorien, die uns auf das neue
Zeitalter der computerwissenschaftlichen Disziplinen vorbereiten.
Parallel hierzu entwickelten sich neue Formen des wissenschaftlichen
Experiments, die der Komplexitaet und Dynamik der neuen
wissenschaftlichen Gegenstaende und Fragestellungen gerecht werden.
Wir fassen diese neuen Formen unter dem Namen der Simulation
(manchmal auch Modellierung); sie beschaeftigen sich nicht mehr mit
dem Verhalten bestimmter, von uns untersuchter Aspekte der Welt,
sondern mit deren Beschreibungen.

Wenn wir die Explosion eines weit entfernten Planeten untersuchen
wollen, brauchen wir Daten ueber einen Zeitraum, der weit ueber das
Alter der Menschheit hinausreicht.  Statt zu warten (sozusagen bis in
alle Ewigkeit), werden astrophysikalische Phaenomene modelliert und
mit Hilfe komplizierter mathematischer Beschreibungsmodelle im
Computer visualisiert.  Auch die Radioastronomie beschaeftigt sich
laengst nicht mehr mit dem Sichtbaren und ist schon gar nicht mit der
Geschichte der Planetennamen belastet.  Ihr Gegenstand sind
Planetensysteme, kosmische Physik, Dynamik und die Entstehung des
Universums.  Die Geometrie vieldimensionaler (mehr als drei) Raeume
hat ebensowenig mit dem Sichtbaren zu tun--mit Landvermessung oder
Hausbau; sie entwickelt theoretische Konstrukte mit einer Praxis des
Denkens, Erklaerens und sogar Handelns, die ohne die Verallgemeinerung
von Raumdimensionen nicht denkbar ist.  Fuer all diese
wissenschaftlichen Taetigkeiten werden wissenschaftliche Sprachen
benoetigt, die mit unserer natuerlichen Sprache wenig zu tun haben und
auch nicht in sie uebersetzbar sind.

Zahlreiche andere Beispiele verdeutlichen die Grenze zwischen der
heutigen Wissenschaft und der natuerlichen Sprache.  In solchen
Forschungszusammenhaengen entsteht auch eine nicht auf Sprache
basierende Rationalitaet.  Mit dem Eintritt der Wissenschaften in das
Computerzeitalter werden aus Notwendigkeiten Moeglichkeiten.  Es gibt
Forschungsbereiche, in denen die Kuerze eines bestimmten Ablaufs die
direkte Beobachtung oder eine angemessene sprachliche Beschreibung
unmoeglich machen.  Solche extrem kurzen Vorgaenge mit schnellem
Energieaustausch und hohen Frequenzmustern koennen nur mit einem
Beobachtungsapparat angegangen werden, dessen Traegheit niedriger ist
als die der untersuchten Phaenomene, und mit einem konzeptuellen
Rahmen, den die Sprache, die durch ein hohes Traegheitsmoment
gekennzeichnet ist, nicht bieten kann.

Die Struktur der Sprache spiegelt denjenigen Erfahrungsbereich wider,
der sie hat entstehen lassen; das Gleiche gilt fuer die Schriftkultur.
Deshalb muessen ihre Strukturen mit den Strukturen der neuen
Lebenspraxis, d. h. der neuen wissenschaftlichen Gegenstaende und
Fragestellungen sowie der neuen Moeglichkeiten des wissenschaftlichen
Arbeitens in Konflikt geraten.  Wir haben die konfligierenden
Strukturelemente in den vorausgegangenen Kapiteln eingehend
diskutiert.  In Frage steht in allen Faellen die Effizienz der
wissenschaftlichen Taetigkeit, die sich zunehmend auch solchen Fragen
wie Rekuperationsmechanismen in Natur und Gesellschaft oder
Strategien der Ko-Evolution mit der Natur (anstelle von
Dominanzstrategien) widmet und dabei mit Hilfe der erhoehten
Vermittlungskapazitaeten und starker integrativer Mechanismen der
Computer holistische Modelle entwickelt.  Eine Idealisierung dieser
neuen Moeglichkeiten waere genauso kontraproduktiv wie eine
Daemonisierung der in unsere Schriftkultur eingebetteten Lebenspraxis.
Dennoch kommen wir nicht umhin, uns damit auseinanderzusetzen, was
nicht mehr den Erfordernissen unserer Entfaltung innerhalb der neuen
Skala der Menschheit entspricht, und uns ein Bild von alternativen
Erfahrungsformen zu machen, in denen sich eine neue Rationalitaet
herausbildet.

In dem sich rapide ausweitenden Zusammenhang, in dem sich unsere
parallel verlaufenden wissenschaftlichen Forschungen und die durch
schnelle und zuverlaessige Netzwerke getragenen verteilten Aufgaben
abspielen, haben sich Wissenschaft und Forschung vom Modell
industrieller Verfahrensweisen ein fuer allemal befreit.  Die
Forschung, an die ich denke, wird nicht mehr in wenigen
zentralistisch organisierten Institutionen abgewickelt, die mit
grossem finanziellen und instrumentellen Aufwand arbeiten; diese
werden vielmehr zunehmend ersetzt durch zahllose Experimente, die an
den verschiedensten Forschungseinrichtungen ueberall auf der Welt
durchgefuehrt werden.  Unter dem Begriff der Tele-Praesenz fassen wir
heute eine Forschungswirklichkeit, innerhalb derer Wissenschaftler,
die Tausende von Meilen voneinander entfernt arbeiten, mit den
unterschiedlichsten Geraeten, Mess- und Testinstrumenten Experimente
gemeinsam durchfuehren.  Die Rolle von Laboratorien als Ort
wissenschaftlicher Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen wird uebernommen
von Kollaboratorien, einer Verbindung aus tatsaechlichen
Forschungsgeraeten, die in den neuen Organisationsformen gleichwohl
effizienter eingesetzt werden koennen, und virtuellen
Forschungsplaetzen, bei denen sich mehr Kreativitaet entfalten kann.
Fuer Forschungen im Nano-Bereich ist Interaktion im woertlichen Sinne
der zeitgleichen Zusammenarbeit und Koordination grundlegend.  Inter-
bzw.  Multidisziplinaritaet ist hier kein Zukunftsziel mehr, sondern
praktische Voraussetzung fuer die Art der Integration, die die
heutigen wissenschaftlichen Projekte erfordern.


Wie wir uns selbst wegerklaeren

Die systematischen Bereiche der menschlichen Taetigkeit veraendern sich
mit rasanter Geschwindigkeit.  Die Wissenschaft, die sich mit immer
kuerzeren und intensiveren Phaenomenen auseinandersetzt, weist
expressive Mittel auf, innerhalb derer die Sprache entweder eine
sekundaere Rolle spielt oder durch andere, nicht-sprachliche
Ausdrucksmittel ersetzt worden ist.  Verfahren, die die Kohaerenz der
heute erforschten Phaenomene in den Griff bekommen, muessen dieser
neuen Wirklichkeit angepasst werden.  Die in der Sprache angelegte
Kohaerenz vermittelt Erfahrungen aus der Vergangenheit, kann aber kaum
solche Erfahrungen angemessen erklaeren, die durch die neuen
Kohaerenzformen gekennzeichnet sind.  In juengerer Zeit hat sich vor
allem eine Frage aufgedraengt: Gibt es irgendein Verbindungselement
zwischen der Sprache, den moeglichen vorhandenen Botschaften, die in
unserem Universum von anderen Zivilisationsformen auf anderen
Planeten ausgetauscht werden, den Informationen, die wir auf unserer
genetischen Ebene austauschen oder jenen biochemischen Spuren, die
wir aus dem Verhalten von Ameisenkolonien oder Bienenvoelkern kennen?
Jede Antwort auf diese Frage waere aus heutiger Sicht voreilig.  David
Hirsch behauptet, wie schon gesagt, dass 97% aller menschlichen
Taetigkeit begriffsfrei vonstatten gehen.  Die Kontrollmechanismen,
denen diese Taetigkeiten unterliegen, kennzeichnen nicht nur den
Menschen, sondern auch biologische Einheiten auf niederer Ebene (z.
B. die Insekten).  Unsere Forschung nach kosmischen
Zivilisationsformen ausserhalb unseres Planeten, Genetik, Biochemie,
von Memetik gar nicht zu reden, wird durch diesen Hinweis nicht
unbedingt gefoerdert.  Unsere Erklaerungsversuche von abstrakten
mathematischen Konzepten oder dem Verhalten komplexer Systeme (wie
etwa dem menschlichen Nervensystem), von denen einige Lernfaehigkeiten
oder Tendenzen der Selbstorganisation aufweisen, stellen uns vor
ungemein hohe Ansprueche: Sind wir mit unseren Bemuehungen, das
menschliche Wesen nachzubilden, im Begriff, uns selbst wegzuerklaeren?
Die Replikation von Gedanken, die auf dem von der Evolutionstheorie
bereitgestellten genetischen Modell basieren, bringt wiederum neue
Perspektiven mit sich.  Doch selbst wenn es uns gelaenge, Methoden fuer
die erfolgreiche Replikation zu entwickeln, haetten wir damit noch
nicht zwangslaeufig die Charakteristika der Selbstidentifikation des
Menschen in den Griff bekommen.

Und es draengt sich eine weitere Frage auf: Wissenschaft ergibt sich
aus der grundlegenden Erkenntnis, dass das Gesetz der Schwerkraft
ueberall gilt, dass Elektrizitaet nicht von den geographischen
Koordinaten des Ortes abhaengt, an dem Menschen leben, und dass das
wissenschaftliche Rechnen am Computer eine universelle Rechenart ist.
Dennoch ist die Wissenschaft nicht wertneutral; ein Modell hat
Vorrang vor einem anderen; eine Form der Rationalitaet setzt sich
gegenueber anderen durch.  Die Wahrheit einer wissenschaftlichen
Theorie und ihre empirische Angemessenheit sind nur lose miteinander
verbunden.  Fuer Wissenschaftler sind Fragen der Wissenschaft oder der
vorherrschenden Modelle eine Frage der Rationalitaet, waehrend sie fuer
andere, die sie in ihren praktischen Lebenszusammenhang einbinden
muessen, zu einer Frage der Angemessenheit werden.  Das ist mehr als
eine kulturelle oder eine memetische Angelegenheit.  Wir sehen uns
vielmehr der Tatsache ausgesetzt, dass die natuerlichen Voraussetzungen
des Menschen ungeachtet der Vernunft oft genug wegerklaert werden.


Die Effizienz der Wissenschaft

Die Sprache hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren vermutlich mehr
veraendert als im Verlauf ihrer gesamten Geschichte.  Dennoch sind
diese Veraenderungen nicht mit der Tiefe und Weite der
wissenschaftlichen und technischen Veraenderungen zu vergleichen.
Bereits das Wort Computerwissenschaft bringt die daran geknuepften
fundamentalen Veraenderungen nicht genuegend klar zum Ausdruck.  Auch
die Bezeichnungen fuer viele andere Erkenntnis- und Taetigkeitsbereiche
sind ungenuegend: kuenstliches Leben, kuenstliche Intelligenz, Genetik,
Memetik usw.  Gleichwohl haben wir angemessene neue Notationssysteme
entwickelt, neue Denkweisen (die qualitative und quantitative Aspekte
miteinander verbinden) und neue (interaktive) Ausdrucksformen.  Aus
diesen neuen Wissenschaften wird sich mit ziemlicher Sicherheit eine
neue Form des menschlichen Daseins ergeben, eine neue conditio humana.
In ihr werden sich die veraenderten Voraussetzungen des
wissenschaftlichen Arbeitens niederschlagen.

Vor mehr als 350 Jahren ist die logische Analyse durch das Prinzip
des Experimentierens ergaenzt worden.  Heute uebernimmt die Simulation
eine aehnliche Aufgabe wie ehedem das Experimentieren.  Sie ist das
Experiment in einem Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur, sie wird die
dominierende wissenschaftliche Ausdrucksform fuer die systematische
Suche nach der Vielzahl von Elementen, die an den neuen
wissenschaftlichen Theorien und deren Anwendungen beteiligt sind.
Eine ganze Anzahl von Simulatoren verfuegt ueber Wissen und Zweifel.
Es kann in einem allgemeineren Zusammenhang gesehen werden.
Simulation traegt jeglicher Variabilitaet Rechnung, erforscht
Relationen und testet funktionale Abhaengigkeiten, und dies auf der
Grundlage einer enormen Datenmenge, die fuer die Leistungsfaehigkeit
neuer Systeme entscheidend ist, bzw. mit Hilfe einer enormen Menge
von Menschen, die in sie eingebunden sind.  Nachdem die Wissenschaft
sich muehsam, aber zwangslaeufig, von der Philosophie losgeloest und
ihre eigenen Methoden entwickelt hat, entdeckt sie aufs Neue die
Notwendigkeit jener Dimension, die das menschliche Denken und die
menschliche Vernunft eingenommen hatte.  Eben dies ist der Gegenstand
der kuenstlichen Intelligenzforschung, und eben dies soll von der
kuenstlichen Intelligenz letztendlich hervorgebracht werden:
Simulationen unserer Denk- und Vernunftfaehigkeit.  In diesem
Zusammenhang beschaeftigen sich Wissenschaftler auch mit der
Metaphysik von den Urspruengen unseres Universums und der Sprache des
Geistes (lingua mentis), von der man annimmt, dass sie sich von der
Sprache unterscheidet, die wir in unserer Lebensgemeinschaft, in
unserem kulturellen und nationalen Dasein gebrauchen.

Wenn wir ueber die Entstehung des Universums oder ueber den
menschlichen Geist nachdenken, heisst das, dass wir uns, mit der
jeweils angemessenen Sprache, in einem pragmatischen Zusammenhang
setzen, der sich von der Interaktion innerhalb einer Gemeinschaft,
von kulturellen Werten oder nationalen Merkmalen unterscheidet.  Der
Fokus verschiebt sich von Quantitaet zu Qualitaet.  Damit verbindet
sich der Versuch, eine Wissenschaft zu errichten, die sich mit
artifizieller Wirklichkeit beschaeftigt und diese schafft.  Als
wissenschaftliches Artefakt ist diese Wirklichkeit mit allen
Merkmalen des Lebens versehen, mit Veraenderung und Evolution durch
zeitliche Ablaeufe hindurch, Auswahl der Tuechtigsten, und zwar der
Besten, die fuer diese Welt besonders tauglich sind, Wissenserwerb,
gesunder Menschenverstand und schliesslich auch Sprache.  Diese
artifizielle Realitaet orientiert sich am Modell des Lebens als
Organisationsmerkmal und generiert lebensaehnliches Verhalten:
iterative Optimierung, Lernen, Wachstum, Anpassungsfaehigkeit,
Reproduktionsfaehigkeit und sogar Selbstidentifikation.  Die
Wissenschaft verfolgt Standardisierungsstrategien.  Artifizielles
Leben ist hingegen bestrebt, Bedingungen fuer Vielfalt zu schaffen,
die die Anpassungsfaehigkeit staerken sollen.  Die Zuweisung von
Ressourcen innerhalb eines Systems und Strategien der KoEvolution
werden als Quellen fuer vermehrte Leistung gewertet.  Die Forschung
geht aber von einer Voraussetzung aus, die eher in den Bereich der
Vernunft, nicht der Rationalitaet gehoert: Menschen und das zur Loesung
anstehende Problem sind bestaendigem Wandel unterworfen.


Die Erforschung des Virtuellen

Virtuelle Realitaeten widmen sich nahezu allem, was auch die Kuenste
beschaeftigt: Illusion von Raum, Zeit, Bewegung und Darstellung
menschlicher Gefuehle.  Wer mit einem solchen System in eine
interaktive Beziehung tritt, wird in das Innere von Bildern,
Geraeuschen und Bewegungen hineingezogen.  Sie alle sind simuliert,
Animation ist hier die neue Wissenschaftssprache, die im bewegten
Bild angelegt ist.  In gewisser Hinsicht wird die virtuelle Realitaet
zu einem Allzwecksimulator einer variablen Wirklichkeit, sie wird
ermoeglicht durch Vermittlungselemente wie Computergraphik, Animation,
digitaler Ton, Positionierungseinheiten und eine ganze Zahl anderer
Elemente.  Innerhalb dieser virtuellen Realitaet stellen sie virtuelle
Gegenstaende, Werkzeuge und Handlungsweisen zur Verfuegung, die uns
Moeglichkeiten unserer Selbstentfaltung und Selbstkonstituierung in
einer Welt des Meta-Wissens eroeffnen.

Eine neue Qualitaetsdimension spielt in der virtuellen Realitaet
insofern eine Rolle, als Wissenschaftler um ein kohaerentes Bild der
ersten Minuten bei der Entstehung des Universums bemueht sind.  Physik,
Genetik, Biophysik, Biochemie, Geologie und alles andere, was in
diesen in vielfaeltiger Weise vermittelten Forschungen eingebunden ist,
vollzieht hier den letzten Schritt von der Wissenschaft zur
Naturgeschichte und zur philosophischen Ontologie.  Die Erklaerung
dafuer, dass Physiker ein nicht weiter teilbares Proton zur Erklaerung
der Materie brauchten, ist nicht eine Frage von Zahlen, Praezision und
Gleichungen, sondern des gesunden Menschenverstands: Wenn Protonen
zerfallen koennten, wuerden Berge, Ozeane, Sterne und Planeten
zusammenbrechen und--zurueck zu Neutronen und Elektronen
verwandelt--wuerde sich der urspruengliche Big Bang in gegenteiliger
Richtung wiederholen.  Mit den neuen experimentellen Methoden, mit
Teilchenbeschleunigung in der Computersimulation, mit den neuen
radioastronomischen Beobachtungsmoeglichkeiten oeffnet die virtuelle
Realitaet neue Formen der Lebenspraxis und ermoeglicht vollkommen neue
physikalische Theorien.  Ist dies alles in der Sprache zu leisten und
durch Sprache zu evaluieren?

Dass der Effizienzfaktor in dieser Entwicklung eine entscheidende
Rolle spielt, ist offensichtlich.  Im Fall der Wissenschaft hat die
allgemeine Effizienzvorstellung verschiedene Komponenten.  Eine Form
der Effizienz liegt darin, die Wissenschaft produktiv zu machen.  Im
Vergleich etwa zur Effizienz von Hebel, Rolle und Flaschenzug ist die
Effizienz des Elektromotors in einer anderen Groessenskala angesiedelt.
Fuer unsere heute neu entwickelten Instrumente gilt das Gleiche,
allerdings auf sehr viel dramatischere Weise.  Die Wissenschaft ist
das aufwendigste und teuerste Unternehmen, das der menschliche Geist
hervorgebracht hat.  Ihre derzeitige Entwicklung wird offenbar durch
eine Eigendynamik angetrieben: Wissen um des Wissens willen.
Wissenschaft brachte aber auch Technologie und Technik hervor, die
jegliche menschliche Taetigkeit und Leistung entscheidend beeinflussen.

Die zweite Effizienzkomponente, die zu unserer neuen Lebenspraxis
gefuehrt hat, liegt in der Notwendigkeit begruendet, diese neuen
Instrumente, die neuen Energieformen und die neuen Formen
menschlicher Interaktion zu beherrschen und zu kontrollieren.  Die
Beherrschung eines mechanischen Werkzeugs ist etwas anderes als die
Beherrschung einer Programmiersprache, mit der eine hochkomplizierte
Technologie und enorme Energiemengen kontrolliert werden.  Aber
obwohl diese neuen Formen der multimedialen Vermittlung in unserem
Leben zugenommen haben, wissen wir noch nicht so recht, wie wir damit
umgehen sollen, und noch weniger, wie wir sie in unsere Bildungs- und
Ausbildungsformen und in die immer kuerzeren Zyklen der
wissenschaftlichen und technologischen Erneuerung integrieren koennen.

Die dritte und letzte Effizienzkomponente ist im Bereich der
Erfindung, Entdeckung und Erklaerung angesiedelt.  Nicht zuletzt unter
dem Druck der gesellschaftlichen Erwartungen (Staat, Geschaeftswelt
und verschiedene Interessengruppen investieren in die Wissenschaft,
um damit bestimmte Ziele zu verfolgen) steht die Wissenschaft unter
hohem Erwartungs- und Leistungsdruck.

Aus der Sicht des Marktes sind diese Erwartungen dann erfuellt, wenn
sich die Investitionen auszahlen.  Enorme Summen gehen daher nicht
nur in zukunftstraechtige wissenschaftliche Projekte, sondern als
Risikokapital in Unternehmensneugruendungen, die die
wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse technologisch umsetzen.  Innerhalb
dieser oekonomischen Dynamik ist jegliche Form der Abkapselung oder
gar der Geheimnistuerei abwegig.  Sofern man versucht,
wissenschaftliche Entwicklungen geheimzuhalten, stoesst man bald an die
Grenzen der wissenschaftlichen Leistungsfaehigkeit: Interaktivitaet und
die Zusammenfuehrung unterschiedlichster, weltweit verbreiteter
wissenschaftlicher Aktivitaeten, Vernetzung dieser Arbeit,
Arbeitsteilung und vor allem geteilte Ressourcen determinieren
heutzutage den Fortschritt in den Wissenschaften.  Insofern ist es
kaum noch verstaendlich, wie in den USA und in Europa die Buerokratie
der Wissenschaftsverwaltung diese neuen Formen der Wissenschaft und
damit den wissenschaftlichen Fortschritt behindert.  Sie stehen noch
immer unter dem schriftkulturellen Einfluss von Nationalstolz,
Sicherheit und aehnlichem und hueten einen Wissenschaftsbetrieb, der
laengst passe ist.

Auch der Konflikt zwischen Wissenschaft und Ethik gewinnt eine neue
Dimension.  Nicht alle wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse, die richtig
sind, sind auch gut fuer die Menschheit.  Hoehere Effizienz kann sich
fuer den Menschen und fuer die Erhaltung des Lebensstandards als
kontraproduktiv erweisen.  In vielen Bereichen--zu viele, um sie
anzufuehren--ist der Mensch bereits vollstaendig durch Maschinen
ersetzt.  Enorme koerperliche oder geistige Anstrengung, Gefahren, die
von Chemikalien, von Strahlung oder anderen widrigen Elementen
ausgehen, koennen auf diese Weise vermieden werden.  Die Entfernung
von Menschen aus Arbeitsprozessen, in denen er sich schliesslich
entfaltet und zu seiner Identitaet gefunden hatte, macht diese
Arbeitsprozesse gewiss auch fragwuerdig.  Heute reden wir nicht mehr
nur ueber die genetische Manipulation der Bevoelkerung, ueber die
geistige Manipulation des Menschen, ueber die Entwicklung
intelligenter Maschinen, die selbst ihre Hersteller beherrschen.  Wir
haben diese Moeglichkeiten alle verwirklicht oder stehen zumindest
kurz vor ihrer Verwirklichung.  Wissenschaft und Technologie, und
noch weniger die Philosophie koennen diesen in der Entwicklung
zwangslaeufig angelegten Konflikt einfach ignorieren.  Auch sollten
wir uns der Gefahr bewusst werden, dass wir allzu leichtfertig und aus
begrenztem Blickwinkel heraus zu scheinbar unproblematischen
wissenschaftlichen Loesungen greifen oder dass wir uns von dem Wahn
leiten lassen, grundsaetzlich alles zu realisieren, was machbar ist.
Immerhin: Wir koennten bereits unseren Planeten zerstoeren, tun dies
aber nicht, oder doch zumindest nicht so radikal, wie wir es tun
koennten.  Vor allem muss sich die Wissenschaft selbst einer
permanenten Selbstkritik und Selbstbefragung unterziehen.  Es ist
daher wohl kein Zufall, dass die Naturwissenschaften nunmehr, jenseits
der Schriftkultur, die Philosophie wiederentdecken oder zumindest
ihrerseits eine Komponente philosophischer Selbstreflexion entwickeln.
Quo vadis, Philosophie?


Die Sprache der Weisheit

Das Nachdenken ueber den Menschen und seine Beziehungen zur Welt (zur
Natur, Kultur und Gesellschaft) stellt eine bestimmte Form der
philosophischen Erfahrung dar.  Sie beinhaltet, sich seiner selbst
und anderer bewusst zu werden; AEhnlichkeiten und Unterschiede zu
erkennen; Veraenderungen in unseren Lebensablaeufen und
Lebensbedingungen zu erklaeren und das so gewonnene Verstehen in die
Formulierung neuer Fragestellungen umzusetzen.  Die praktischen
Implikationen philosophischer Systeme sind vielfaeltig.  Sie
beeinflussen die wissenschaftliche, moralische, politische,
kulturelle oder sonstwie geartete Form menschlicher Selbstentfaltung
in der Welt.  Philosophische Systeme vermehren nicht unbedingt Wissen,
sondern Weisheit.  Insofern ist das klassische Modell der
Philosophie als Dachwissenschaft aller Wissenschaften, oder zumindest
als alma mater aller Wissenschaften, noch immer gueltig.  Im Zentrum
philosophischer Systeme stehen menschliche Werte, nicht Faehigkeiten
oder Fertigkeiten, mit denen man bestimmte, durch eine Rationalitaet
vorgegebene Ziele erreichen kann.  Dennoch ist der Status der
Philosophie durch innere und aeussere Faktoren zunehmend in Frage
gestellt.  Wenn die Philosophie an Bedeutung verloren hat, dann wohl
nicht zuletzt auch deshalb, weil die Philosophen einerseits mit dem
Anspruch der Allwissenheit auftraten, sich andererseits aber mit den
zentralen Aspekten der menschlichen Vernunft nur wenig beschaeftigt
haben.

Die Philosophie besass schon immer einen gewissen exklusiven Status.
Heute ist aus ihr eine Diskursform geworden, die sich entweder in
furchtbar gestelzter und umstaendlicher Sprache oder in einer Vielzahl
von spezialisierten Sprachen an einen relativ kleinen Kreis von
Eingeweihten wendet, in aller Regel ihrerseits Philosophen.  Die
veraenderte Rolle der Philosophie drueckt sich auch im gegenwaertigen
Sprachgebrauch aus.  Jeder spricht heute von "seiner Philosophie" und
meint damit alles Moegliche--Investitionsstrategien oder Strategien im
Fussball, Drogengebrauch oder Gesundheitsdiaeten, Politik, Religion und
vieles andere.

Missverstandene, aus der Schriftkultur uebernommene kulturelle
Beduerfnisse und politische Bequemlichkeit fuehren dazu, dass die
tradierte Form der Philosophie als Fach an den Universitaeten gelehrt
wird ohne Ruecksicht darauf, was in diesem Fach gelehrt wird, wer es
lehrt oder welche Mittel er dafuer verwendet.  In den kommunistischen
Laendern ist Philosophie ein Pflichtfach gewesen, unter dessen
Bezeichnung die herrschende Ideologie vermittelt und gefestigt wurde.
In den liberalen Laendern hat die Philosophie ihren Glanz verloren;
hier ist die philosophische Abstraktion ein eben solches
Schreckgespenst wie der Mangel an Geld.  Insofern ist allenthalben
eine philosophische Unbildung zu verzeichnen.  Sie ist jedoch nicht
das Ergebnis von abnehmenden Lese- und Schreibfaehigkeiten, sondern
einer veraenderten Lebenspraxis.

Weder die Spezialisierung der Sprache der Philosophie noch die
Einbindung logisch-mathematischer Formalismen und Operationen haben
der Philosophie oder dem Philosophen das urspruengliche Prestige
zurueckgeben koennen.  Zur Loesung der ihr eigenen, vor allem auf
menschlicher Erfahrung und das Gewissen bezogenen Fragen hat sie kaum
etwas beigetragen.  Vielmehr hat sich die Philosophie als
Dachwissenschaft verfluechtigt in eine ganze Zahl von
Einzelphilosophien: analytische, europaeische, feministische,
afro-amerikanische, gruene Philosophie usw.  Jede dieser
Teilsdisziplinen hat eine eigene Sprache entwickelt und verfolgt
Fragestellungen, die in der Philosophie oder der Politik der
Schriftkultur verwurzelt sind.

Die Bedeutung (oder Bedeutungslosigkeit) der Philosophie ist nach wie
vor festzumachen an der Praxis des Fragens und Antwortens, einer
Praxis, aus der heraus sich die Philosophie urspruenglich entwickelt
hat.  Als eine Praxis, die dem menschlichen Wesen im Universum
menschlicher Erfahrung einen Platz zuweist, ist die Philosophie
ebenso relevant wie die praktischen Ergebnisse, die sich aus dieser
Positionierung des Menschen ergeben.  Viele wissenschaftliche
Theorien, wie z. B. die Relativitaetstheorie in der Physik oder die
Gentheorie in der Biologie, sind in philosophischer Hinsicht genauso
relevant wie in wissenschaftlicher Hinsicht.  Andererseits weisen
auch zahlreiche philosophische Theorien eine erhebliche
wissenschaftliche Bedeutung auf: zahlreiche Komponenten im System der
Leibnizschen Philosophie, in Descartes’ Rationalismus oder in Peirces
Pragmatizismus.  Sie alle entwickelten sich in einem bestimmten
pragmatischen Erfahrungsrahmen, in dem sich Vernunft zur Geltung
brachte und spezifische Formen der Rationalitaet in Frage stellte.

Die Philosophie, wie wir sie aus den ueberlieferten philosophischen
Texten kennen, ist ein Ergebnis jener Erfahrungen, die die Schrift
moeglich (wenn auch nicht universell akzeptiert) und spaeter
Schriftkultur notwendig machten.  Ihre fundamentalen Oppositionen
entsprechen dabei im grossen und ganzen den im Rahmen der Sprache
gefundenen praktischen Erfahrungen: Subjekt/Objekt,
rational/irrational, Materie/Geist, Form/Inhalt,
analytisch/synthetisch, konkret/abstrakt, Wesen/Phaenomen.  Auch der
traditionelle gnoseologische Ansatz der Philosophie und die auf der
aristotelischen Logik basierende formale Logik weisen eben diese
Sprachstruktur auf.  Die grundlegende linguistische Unterscheidung
zwischen Subjekt und Praedikat kennzeichnet zumindest fuer die
westlichen Kulturkreise diesen Ansatz.  Die zur Industriellen
Revolution hinfuehrenden Effizienzerwartungen blieben nicht ohne
Einfluss auf die Lage der Philosophie.  An diesem ihrem Wendepunkt
erkannten die Philosophen die praktischen Aspekte ihrer Disziplin.
Marx war davon ueberzeugt, dass der Mensch mit ihr die Welt veraendern
wuerde.  In der Tat hat sich die Welt veraendert, aber auf eine ganz
andere Weise, als er und seine Anhaenger dies prophezeit hatten.  Der
feste Griff der verdinglichten Sprache hatte aus dem Arbeiterparadies
eine geistige Folterkammer gemacht.

Mit den Veraenderungen der grundlegenden Strukturen veraenderte sich
auch die Philosophie und befreite sich von den Sprachkategorien, die
ihren spekulativen Diskurs geformt hatten.  Ungeachtet dieser
Veraenderungen hielten Bildungsinstitutionen, Berufsverbaende und auch
Fachkonferenzen an den alten, aus den schriftkulturellen Erwartungen
abgeleiteten Zielen und Funktionen fest.  Das fuehrte zu heftigen
Abgrenzungsversuchen (zu deren Hauptvertretern Feyerabend und Lakatos
gehoeren), die einer philosophischen Praxis das Wort redeten, die sich
der relativen Natur ihrer Aussagen bewusst ist.

Die in den Eingangskapiteln dargelegten neuen Formen der Logik und
wissenschaftliches Rechnen in algorithmischer und
nicht-algorithmischer Form befreite die Philosophie von den in der
traditionellen Sprache der Philosophie eingebetteten Dualismen.
Zufriedenstellendere Antworten auf ontologische, gnoseologische,
epistemologische und sogar historische Fragen muessen diese neuen,
kognitiv relevanten Wissensperspektiven erkennen lassen.  Mit ihrer
Mathematisierung gewinnt die Philosophie neuen Zugang zur
Wissenschaft und damit eine erhoehte Effizienz.  Sie ist logik- und
rechnerorientiert, hat genetische Schemata fuer die Erklaerung von
Variation und Auswahl uebernommen und sich um heute gelaeufige
memetische Methoden bereichert.  Nun ist es in der Philosophie zwar
keineswegs ungewoehnlich, dass man auf das Aufwaermen alter Theorien und
Sehweisen verzichtet und sich statt dessen um das Verstaendnis neuer
pragmatischer Beduerfnisse bemueht.  Die Verwissenschaftlichung der
Philosophie konnte sich indes erst durchsetzen, nachdem die Sprache
als einziges gedankliches Medium und die damit verbundene
Vorherrschaft der Schriftkultur ueberwunden waren.


In wissenschaftlichem Gewand

Viele von uns erinnern sich vielleicht noch an die Probleme, die
Alice in Lewis Carrolls Through the Looking Glass mit der Sprache hat,
vor allem mit den vielfaeltigen Bedeutungen, die einzelne Woerter
annehmen koennen.  Wenn wir vor diesem Hintergrund die grossen
philosophischen Werke von Platon ueber Leibniz, Kant und Hegel bis zu
Peirce und anderen Revue passieren lassen, sehen wir Alices Kummer in
einem anderen Licht.  Abgesehen von Wittgenstein hat wohl kaum jemand
Anstoss an der menschlichen Faehigkeit genommen, einzelnen Woertern
soviel unterschiedliche Bedeutung zukommen zu lassen.

Wenn wir uns heute fragen, was die Welt nachhaltig veraendern, was sie
"bewegen" koennte, wuerden wir die Antwort auf diese Frage vermutlich
in einem neuen Zeichensystem sehen.  Das von Peirce entwickelte
kognitive Modell des diagrammatischen Denkens ist hierfuer ein gutes
Beispiel.  Weitere Bereiche, in denen solche Zeichensysteme
entwickelt wurden, sind Kybernetik, Biogenetik, computergestuetztes
Rechnen, die Erforschung der kuenstlichen Intelligenz und des
kuenstlichen Lebens sowie politische, soziale, aesthetische und
religioese Begriffe.  Sie alle haben neue Formen der menschlichen
Selbstkonstituierung erleichtert, die nun gemeinsam zum
widerspruechlichen Bild der heutigen Welt beitragen.  Alle diese
Sprachen veranschaulichen den fuer unsere heutige Zeit grundlegenden
Prozess der zunehmenden und fortschreitenden Vermittlung, der
Auffaecherung in zahllose Spezialsprachen und der Veraenderung im
Status und im Wertesystem des Schriftkulturideals.  Sie verleihen der
Philosophie ihr wissenschaftliches Gewand.  Klarheit (die nur schwer
in der natuerlichen Sprache zu erreichen ist), Evidenz und Sicherheit
scheinen in der Wissenschaftssprache selbstverstaendlich.  Hinzu
kommen Objektivitaet und die seit jeher verfuehrerische Wahrheit, mit
der sich die Philosophie immer schwer getan hat, zumindest als
annaeherbare Groesse.

Fuer die permanente Entfaltung des philosophischen Diskurses gibt es
einen inneren Grund: Die Menschen, die Philosophie betreiben,
veraendern sich in dem Masse, wie sich die Welt veraendert, in der sie
leben.  Menschliches Denken ist Teil dieser Welt; die Faehigkeit und
der Drang, ueber neue Fragen nachzudenken, neue Antworten zu suchen
sowie der Zweifel an unserer Faehigkeit, jemals die richtige Antwort
zu finden, ist ein wesentlicher Teil dessen, was den Menschen
auszeichnet.  Wir sollten uns vor Augen fuehren, dass die erhoehte
Vermittlung auch fuer die Philosophie Folgen mit sich bringt.
Vermittlung bedeutet einerseits ein hohes Mass an Integration dessen,
was die menschliche Praxis hervorbringt, und andererseits ein nicht
weniger hohes Mass an Unabhaengigkeit, das das Subjekt gegenueber dem
Gegenstand der Arbeit oder des Nachdenkens gewinnt.  Es leuchtet wohl
ein, dass die Wissenschaft immer mehr Wissen ueber einen immer
begrenzteren Bereich von Gegenstaenden erlangt; dieser Umstand steht
aber im Widerspruch zu der Vorstellung von Philosophie, die sich in
der Sprache herausgebildet hat und die im Ideal der Schriftkultur
verkoerpert ist.  Gemaess dieser metaphorisch definierten Vertiefung des
Wissens gewinnen die Philosophen untereinander an Unabhaengigkeit,
werden aber aufgrund der notwendigen Verknuepfung dieses Wissens
staerker als je zuvor in einen Forschungsverbund eingebunden.  Was
diese paradoxe Situation im einzelnen bedeutet, ist nicht leicht
darzulegen.  Allgemein zeichnen sich zwei qualitativ gegensaetzliche
Richtungen ab:
1. die Konzentration auf einen praezise bezeichneten Bereich des
Wissens oder Handelns, um diesen genau verstehen und kontrollieren zu
koennen;
2. ein abnehmendes Interesse am Ganzen, das sich nicht zuletzt aus
der Annahme ergibt, dass die Teile letztendlich durch die
gesellschaftlichen Integrationsmechanismen des Marktes nolens volens
wieder vereint werden.
Wir haben heute eine ganze Reihe von philosophischen
Einzeldisziplinen, Rechtsphilosophie, Ethik, Wissenschaftsphilosophie,
Sport, Erholung, Feminismus, OEkologie, Afrozentrismus--aber keine
allumfassende Existenzphilosophie mehr.

Die wissenschaftliche Einkleidung der Philosophie traegt zu deren
Bemuehen bei, eine neue Legitimitaet zu gewinnen.  Sie arbeitet mit
Begriffen und Methoden, die an Rationalitaet orientiert sind, und
entfaltet sich in Naturwissenschaft und Technologie.  Durkheim hat
das Phaenomen der Arbeitsteilung mit Hilfe von Darwins Modell der
natuerlichen Auslese erklaert.  Heute versuchen die Philosophen, die
sich als Memetiker verstehen, Darwins Prinzipien an Rechnern zu
simulieren, um daran das UEberleben und die Fortentwicklung von Ideen
zu beobachten.  Spencer war davon ueberzeugt, dass die Zunahme an
produktiver Arbeitskraft das Glueck des Menschen vermehren wuerde.
Heute versuchen Philosophen, die Relation zwischen Befriedigung in
der Arbeit und Persoenlichkeit im Diagramm zu erfassen.  Wieder andere
verhelfen Comtes Positivismus zu neuem Leben, entwickeln utopische
Systeme aus vergangenen Zeiten weiter oder ersinnen eine
Berechnungsmethode fuer intellektuelles Wohlergehen.  Einem
Philosophen, der die traditionellen Grenzen der Philosophiegeschichte
hinter sich lassen moechte, kann im Prinzip alles zum Gegenstand des
philosophischen Hinterfragens werden.

Wann immer neue Bewegungen, von denen einige mehr, andere weniger
gerechtfertigt waren und die allesamt die Verlagerung von einer auf
Autoritaet gruendenden Schriftkultur hin zur grenzenlosen Wahlfreiheit
in einem schriftkulturlosen Zusammenhang widerspiegeln, wirksame
Instrumente zur Unterstuetzung ihrer Programme benoetigten, griffen sie
zurueck auf die Philosophie oder wurden von der Philosophie ergriffen.
So treffen heute im Namen der Philosophie Saekularismus und
Pluralismus mit vielen anderen Bewegungen zusammen, mit der
Schwulenbewegung, dem Feminismus, Multikulturalismus,
Alternsforschung, neuen Holismen, Populaerphilosophie, sexueller
Emanzipation, Virtualitaet und vielem mehr.  Diese Situation laesst den
Drang der philosophischen Bemuehungen nach neuer Effizienz erkennen,
zugleich aber auch Anstrengungen, die Beziehungen zur Schriftkultur
beizubehalten.  Die enorme Bandbreite der Gegenstaende, die heute fuer
die Philosophie attraktiv zu sein scheinen, obwohl sie sich ganz
offensichtlich nicht zum philosophischen Gegenstand eignen, laesst
berechtigte Zweifel aufkommen.  Sofern die Sprache der Philosophie
nicht ohnehin unverstaendlich ist, scheint sie sich heute damit zu
begnuegen, Dinge zu diskutieren, statt Gruende zu hinterfragen oder gar
neue Gedanken oder Erklaerungsmodelle zu entwickeln.  Billige
Verallgemeinerungen helfen niemandem weiter, und man kann sich des
Eindrucks nicht erwehren, dass die Befreiung der Philosophie von der
Schriftkultur viel weniger produktiv ist als der vergleichbare
Befreiungsprozess der Naturwissenschaften von der Sprache.

Wenn wir uns im World Wide Web die Bereiche naeher anschauen, die der
Philosophie gewidmet sind, wird dieser Eindruck nachdruecklich
bestaetigt.  Insgesamt scheint es so, als habe die Philosophie dieses
neue Medium als Alternative zum traditionellen philosophischen
Diskurs noch nicht akzeptiert.  Nicht zuletzt deshalb setzt sich wohl
die Meinung durch, dass die Naturwissenschaftler selbst die besten
philosophischen UEberlegungen zu ihren eigenen Beitraegen zu bieten
haben.


Wer braucht Philosophie und wozu?

Brauchen wir heute noch Philosophie?  Ist sie ohne die sprachliche
Vermittlung zwischen den Philosophen und ihrem Publikum ueberhaupt
noch moeglich?  Koennen wir ohne sie leben?  Kann sie im Zeitalter
hochgradiger Spezialisierung noch als vermittelnde Instanz zwischen
den Menschen wirken?  Kann sie je noch als Selbstbewusstsein der
Menschheit fungieren, wie es sich in Hegels Philosophie ausdrueckt?
Und worin koennte ihre Aufgabe liegen, wenn sie tatsaechlich in den
Naturwissenschaften aufginge, Teil des naturwissenschaftlichen
Fachdiskurses wuerde?

Ich tendiere dazu, der Philosophie ebenso wie der Schriftkultur trotz
der veraenderten Situation und Bedeutung der Sprache auch weiterhin
Moeglichkeiten und Relevanz einzuraeumen.  Ihre Funktionen muessen im
pragmatischen Zusammenhang noch definiert werden--als
Vermittlungsinstanz, als Selbstbewusstsein der Menschheit, als
deutender Diskurs ueber die Menschheit und die Natur.  Wir muessen
nicht noch einmal im einzelnen wiederholen, dass die Philosophie in
den verschiedenen Skalen der Menschheit unterschiedliche Interessen
verfolgt hat, die sich aus den jeweiligen Effizienzerwartungen
ergeben hatten.  Noch nie hat uns die Philosophie Brot auf den Tisch
gestellt oder Werkzeuge an die Hand gegeben.  Ihre Fertigkeit bestand
darin, Fragen zu formulieren, vor allem die entscheidenden
Fragen--"Was ist was?" und "Warum?"; mit diesen Fragen hat sie nach
den Urspruengen der Dinge geforscht.  Indem sie nach den Gruenden von
Phaenomenen und Handlungen forschte, mit anderen Worten: Indem sie
versuchte, die Welt und die scheinbare Ordnung der Welt zu verstehen,
war sie gleichzeitig Philosophie und Deuter der Wissenschaften.
Daraus entwickelten sich die weiteren entscheidenden Fragen, "Wie
koennen wir Wissen erlangen?" und "Wie koennen wir erklaeren?"  Diese
Fragen wurden dann jedoch nicht mehr von den eigentlichen Philosophen,
sondern zwingender von denen weiterverfolgt, die nach
wissenschaftlicher Rationalitaet suchten.

Keine noch so detaillierte Philosophiegeschichte kann uns eine
ausreichende Definition von Philosophie geben.  Der Gegenstand der
Philosophie veraendert sich, wie sich die Menschen im Verlauf ihrer
praktischen Selbstkonstituierung veraendern.  Alle Natur- und
Geisteswissenschaften (Ethik, AEsthetik, Politik, Soziologie und
Rechtswissenschaft) haben sich aus der Philosophie heraus entwickelt.
Selbst unsere Beschaeftigung mit der Sprache ist letztendlich
philosophischer Natur.  Philosophie ist wohl die einzige wirkliche
Form der Abstraktion.  Sie ist nicht am Individuum interessiert, am
Phaenomen, am Unmittelbaren, nicht einmal am Gedanken, sondern immer
nur an der Abstraktion derselben.  Selbst wenn andere Disziplinen wie
Mathematik, Logik, Linguistik oder Physik sich um die abstrakten
Vorstellungen im Umfeld ihrer Disziplinen bemuehen, um ihnen dann im
Zusammenhang ihrer praktischen Erfahrungen Leben zu verleihen, sucht
die Philosophie doch immer wieder die naechsthoehere Abstraktionsebene,
die Abstraktion der Abstraktionen.  Die Naturwissenschaft verwendet
Abstraktionen als Instrument, um an das Konkrete heranzukommen; die
Philosophie geht den entgegengesetzten Weg. Sie sucht immer den
naechsten Schritt, den Schritt in das Unendliche.  Jedes Ergebnis ist
vorlaeufig.  Philosophisches Experimentieren besteht nicht darin,
systematisch nach Ursachen zu suchen, sondern darin, das Suchen,
Fragen und Nachfragen niemals abbrechen zu lassen.  Es gibt keine
richtigen oder falschen philosophischen Theorien.  Philosophie ist
ihrem Wesen nach kumulativ und selbstverzehrend.

Die Menschen werden niemals aufhoeren zu staunen und sich zu fragen,
was ist was?, schon gar nicht, solange ihre Taetigkeit den Bereich der
Dinge, des Seienden staendig erweitert.  Sie werden sich immer wieder
fragen, was sie wissen koennen, mit welcher Gewissheit sie das, was sie
wissen, fuer wahr oder wenigstens fuer relevant halten duerfen.  Der
Mensch ist gekennzeichnet durch seine Faehigkeit zu denken, Dinge
herzustellen und Werkzeuge zu beherrschen, Werte zu entwickeln und
sich mit anderen Menschen als Lebensgemeinschaft mit gemeinsamen
Anliegen und Ressourcen zu konstituieren, und dies im freien Spiel
seiner Kraefte, Moeglichkeiten und Charakteristika (die in solchen
Begriffen wie homo œconomicus, zoon semioticon, zoon politikon, homo
ludens gefasst sind).  All diese Bezeichnungen moegen wesentliche
Aspekte der Menschheit benennen.  Das einzig wirklich herausragende
Merkmal des Menschen liegt indes darin, dass er denken und alles
hinterfragen kann.  So wie die genetische Anlage des Menschen durch
die Sprache gekennzeichnet ist, so ist sie durch Denken und Fragen
gekennzeichnet, die sich vermutlich zuallererst in Sprachmechanismen
aeusserten.  Wenn ein Kind seine erste Frage stellt, ist seine gesamte
genetische Anlage involviert.

Wir sind, wer und was wir sind, durch unsere fragende Interaktion mit
anderen Menschen.  Geist und Verstand existieren nur durch diese
Interaktion.  Das bedeutet, dass das Philosophieren Teil der
menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung und Identitaetsfindung ist.  Der
einzige Gegenstand der Philosophie ist der Mensch mit seiner
Entfaltung in der Lebenspraxis.  Zusammen mit anderen fortlebenden
Formen der Bildung und der Schriftkultur wird auch die Philosophie
als eine von vielen anderen fortwirken.  Aber jenseits der
Schriftkultur wird die Philosophie wie in allen vorangegangenen
Stadien der Menschheit die Arbeits- und Lebensumstaende widerspiegeln,
die fuer den neuen pragmatischen Rahmen charakteristisch sind.  Sie
wird sich auch dem Test der Marktbeduerfnisse unterziehen muessen.  Die
Wissenschaft kann die hohen Investitionen mit neuen
Erklaerungsmodellen rechtfertigen.  Auch kann sie neue technologische
Entwicklungen anstossen.  Die Philosophie muss ihre Rechtfertigung
indes auf andere Weise suchen.  Die Notwendigkeit ihres Tuns ist nur
schwer fassbar.  Da sie nicht wie die schriftkulturelle Bildung,
Religion oder Kunst von der Vergangenheit lebt, muss sie sich neu
besinnen auf die Vernunft als den Bereich menschlicher Taetigkeit.
Wenn sich die Philosophie mit alternativen Formen der Lebenspraxis
auseinandersetzt, kann sie auf sehr praktische Weise den Menschen
helfen, sich einerseits von der Fortschrittsbesessenheit--sofern wir
Fortschritt verstehen als eine Folge sich staendig uebertreffender
Rekorde in Produktion, Distribution und Erwartung--und andererseits
von der Furcht vor all den Konsequenzen des Fortschritts zu befreien.
Auch koennte sie die Aufmerksamkeit des Menschen darauf richten,
Alternativen zu all dem zu entwickeln, was die Unversehrtheit der
Gattung und seine Qualitaetsansprueche beeintraechtigt, das Verhaeltnis
des Menschen zur Umwelt mit eingeschlossen.  Wenn Vergangenheit,
Gegenwart und Zukunft im allumgreifenden ungebildeten Wahn des
Augenblicks kollabieren, dann ist die Philosophie uns eine Antwort
auf die Frage schuldig, ob es noch eine Zukunft gibt.  Aber diese
Zukunft gewinnt Gestalt durch Menschen, die an der offenen Welt der
vernetzten Interaktionen teilhaben.  Banalitaeten werden als Antworten
auf diese entscheidende Frage mithin nicht genuegen.



Kapitel 4:


Ein Gespuer fuer Design

Im Englischen heisst to design woertlich "mit Zeichen (sign) umgehen".
Design, Gestalten und Entwerfen, heisst also einerseits, mit Hilfe von
Zeichen Gedanken, Gefuehle und kommunikative Absichten auszudruecken,
und andererseits, seine eigene Persoenlichkeit in Gegenstaende
einzubringen, die fuer die praktischen Erfahrungen des Menschen eine
Rolle spielen.  Die unmittelbare praktische Erfahrung kannte keine
Gestaltung, kein Design.  Die Verwendung von Zeichen ermoeglicht es
uns, die Gegenwart auf die Zukunft hin zu transzendieren.  In der
Natur bedeutet Zukunft Befruchtung.  In der Kultur bedeutet Zukunft
Bezeichnung, etwas in Zeichen bringen, d. h. etwas durch Zeichen
ausdruecken, etwas entwerfen.  Im weitesten Sinn ist das Gestalten und
Entwerfen die Selbstbestimmung des Menschen, als jemand, der
Veraenderung bewirkt.  Diese veraendernden Eingriffe betreffen die
Umwelt und unsere Wahrnehmung von Dingen (Werkzeuge eingeschlossen),
von Haeusern, Kleidung, Braeuchen, religioesen Zeremonien,
Veranstaltungen, Nachrichten, Interpretationszusammenhaengen,
Interaktionen und in juengster Zeit auch von ganz neuen Stoffen und
virtuellen Realitaeten.  Shakespeare haette am Eifer, mit dem unsere
Zeit Design betreibt, seine Freude gehabt.  Er beschreibt Design
folgendermassen: "...Und wie die schwangre Phantasie Gebilde / Von
unbekannten Dingen ausgebiert” (Ein Sommernachtstraum).  Obwohl
Gestalten und Entwerfen sprachliche Elemente aufweisen, sind sie
dennoch im Grundsatz nichtsprachlich.  Die wesentlichen Ausdrucks-
und Kommunikationsmittel sind visueller Art.  Diese koennen
unterstuetzt werden durch andere Mittel, wie Ton, Textur, Geschmack
und Geruch und deren Kombination (Synaesthesie), Rhythmus, Farbe und
Bewegung.

Die Natur bietet sich dem Menschen, der seine Identitaet durch
praktische Erfahrungen schafft, als etwas Gegebenes dar.  In
Abgrenzung dazu erscheint die Natur des Menschen in der Retrospektive
als etwas Gestaltetes.  In einigen Faellen bedeutet Gestalten
Selektieren.  Man nimmt etwas aus seiner gewohnten Umgebung
heraus--einen Stock, einen Stein, eine Pflanze--und gibt ihm eine
neue, un-natuerliche Funktion, indem man es in etwas anderes einfuegt,
sei es zur Markierung von Land, zur Arbeitserleichterung, zum Stuetzen
eines Koerperteils, zum Fallenstellen, fuer Angriff und Verteidigung
oder zum Faerben von Kleidung oder Haut.  Manchmal folgt dem Akt der
Selektion eine Form der Rahmensetzung, so wie der Rahmen bei einem
Tanzritual um den Totempfahl, bei einem Tieropfer, bei
Trauerzeremonien oder Sieges- und Fruchtbarkeitsfeiern.  Selektion
und Rahmensetzung haengen mit Effizienzerwartungen zusammen.  Sie
symbolisieren die Hoffnung auf Hilfe von magischen Kraeften und
druecken die Bereitschaft aus, fuer ein Individuum, fuer die Familie
oder fuer die Gemeinschaft einzutreten.  Dies ist bereits bei den
ersten Versuchen einer pragmatischen Rahmensetzung sichtbar.  Eines
der wiederkehrenden Muster beim Gestalten und Entwerfen ist, die
formalen Merkmale, die in der Natur als schoen empfunden werden,
nachzuahmen und diese dann in eine optimale Form in der Zukunft zu
integrieren.  Auf diese Weise fliesst die aesthetische Dimension des
menschlichen Alltags in die Taetigkeit des Entwerfens und Gestaltens
ein.

Notationssysteme (z. B. quipu, zeichnerische Abbildungen auf Stein
oder auf dem Boden, oder Hieroglyphen), die sich spaeter zu einer
Schrift entwickelten, koennen als Design bezeichnet werden, nicht
zuletzt wegen ihrer aesthetischen Kohaerenz.  Erst wenn sprachlich
definierte Regeln und Erwartungen an die Stelle des Zeichensystems
treten, loest sich Schrift vom Design und wird Teil der
Spracherfahrung.  So erklaert sich, dass Veraenderungen in der Sprache,
die einen Rahmen fuer die Erfahrung von Zeit und Raum bildet, nicht
unbedingt auch Veraenderungen im Bereich des Designs mit sich bringen.
Als sich die Schriftkultur herausbildete, war die ihr zugrunde
liegende Struktur in dem Gebrauch der Sprache eingebunden.  Dies gilt
nicht in gleichem Mass fuer die Praxis des Designs.  An diesem Punkt
etabliert sich Design als eigenstaendige praktische Disziplin mit
eigener Dynamik und eigenen Zielen.  Es ist kein Zufall, dass das
technische Design als eine praktische Notwendigkeit im Zuge des Baus
von Pyramiden, Zikkurats und Tempeln entstand und seinen Hoehepunkt
waehrend der Industriellen Revolution im Entwurf und Gestalten von
Maschinen fand.  Die Praemisse des Industriezeitalters ist: Alles ist
eine mechanische Maschine: Das Haus, die Kutsche, OEfen, die im
Unterricht verwendeten Geraete, Schulen, Universitaeten, Ateliers,
sogar die Natur.

In der Industriegesellschaft war Designtaetigkeit eine relativ
begrenzte und homogene praktische Taetigkeit.  Jenseits der
Schriftkultur jedoch gewann sie eine umfassende Bedeutung, die sich
auf viele spezialisierte Anwendungsbereiche auswirkte: Werkzeugdesign,
Modedesign, Textildesign, Produktdesign, Graphikdesign, die vielen
Teilgebiete des technischen Designs (einschliesslich des
computergestuetzten Designs), interaktive Medien und virtuelle
Realitaeten, Gentechnik, neue Werkstoffe, event design (in
verschiedenen Bereichen, z. B. Politik), Netzwerkdesign und
Bildungsdesign.  Einfache und komplexe Technologien, die visuelle
Sprache hervorbringen, schaffen komplexe Zusammenhaenge, fuer die der
intuitive Gebrauch visueller Ausdrucksmoeglichkeiten nicht mehr
effektiv genug ist.  Folglich aenderte sich die Bandbreite
designorientierter praktischer Erfahrungen.  Design erlaubt heute
umfassendere, integrative Projekte auf hoeheren Synaesthesieebenen und
gleichzeitig Formen variablen Designs, eines Designs, das mit dem
Menschen waechst, der sich in der Interaktionen mit einer durch Design
gestalteten Welt konstituiert.

In seiner digitalen Arbeitswelt hat das Design mehr als jede andere
praktische Erfahrung die Schriftkultur ersetzt.  Die Ergebnisse des
Designs unterscheiden sich dem Wesen nach von denen, zu denen die
Schriftkultur fuehrt.


Die Zukunft zeichnen

Zeichnen beginnt mit dem Sehen und fuehrt zu einer Art von Wahrnehmung,
einem Verstaendnis von Welt, das sich von dem durch Sprache
gefilterten Weltverstaendnis unterscheidet.  Aus kognitiver Sicht
impliziert Zeichnen, dass derjenige, der seine Identitaet durch den Akt
des Zeichnens setzt, das Innere und AEussere des Gezeichneten kennt.
Zeichnen setzt voraus, dass Dinge von innen heraus wachsen und sich zu
einem aktiven Ganzen formen.  Sichtbare und unsichtbare Teile wirken
in einer Zeichnung zusammen, Oberflaeche und Umfang wirken ineinander,
Luecken und Ausfuellungen ergaenzen sich im dynamischen visuellen
Ausdruck.  Jede Linie einer Zeichnung ergibt erst in ihrer Beziehung
zu einer anderen Linie Sinn.  Im Gegensatz zu Woertern und Saetzen
ergibt sich das Verstehen der einzelnen Elemente erst im Bild selbst.
Visuelle Darstellung erreicht im Gegensatz zum sprachlichen Ausdruck
ihre Kohaerenz erst als konfigurales Ganzes.  Man kann das Wort Tisch
schreiben, ohne das bezeichnete Objekt zu kennen.  Um einen alten
Tisch zu zeichnen oder einen neuen Tisch zu entwerfen, muss ich einen
Tisch und seine Funktion indes gut kennen.  Etwas zu entwerfen oder
zu gestalten bedeutet, sich in einer Sprache auszudruecken, die das
Machen beinhaltet.  Desweiteren impliziert es das Wissen darum, dass
mit dem vorgestellten Objekt bestimmte praktische Erwartungen
verbunden sind.  Folglich bedeutet das Design eines Tisches, dass ich
seine Funktionen praktisch erfahre, bevor ich ihn konkret entwerfe.
Entwerfen ist also eine virtuelle praktische Erfahrung im Grenzgebiet
zwischen dem, was ist, und dem, was die neuen Erfahrungen der
Selbstkonstituierung verlangen.

Im Akt des Designs projiziert der Mensch seine biologischen und
kulturellen Merkmale in das hinein, was er entwirft.  Das entspricht
der Tatsache, dass Design aus praktischen Erfahrungen hervorgegangen
ist und das Moegliche um das Wuenschenswerte erweitert.  Der Begriff
Funktionalitaet bringt das zum Ausdruck, wenn auch nur teilweise.  Mit
der Entstehung bestimmter in der Schriftkultur verankerter
Bedingungen--Ziel- und Absichtserklaerungen, Beschreibung vorhandener
Mittel, Bewertungsverfahren--trafen Bild und schriftliche Entwuerfe
zusammen.  Die Schriftkultur bewirkte Veraenderungen im Bereich des
Designs.  Diese aeusserten sich in allgemeinen Erwartungen von
Dauerhaftigkeit, Allgemeingueltigkeit, Dualismus, Zentralismus und
Hierarchie.  Internationaler Stil--ein Ausdruck, der weit ueber eine
blosse Stilbezeichnung hinausgeht--spiegelt die durch die
Schriftkultur gestellten Erwartungen an das Design wider.

Ist Zeichnen natuerlich?  Diese Frage ergibt nur mit der dazugehoerigen
Frage einen Sinn: Ist Schriftkultur unnatuerlich oder kuenstlich?
Alles bisher ueber das Zeichnen Gesagte impliziert, dass es keinesfalls
natuerlich ist, obwohl es dem Abgebildeten naeher ist als die Abbildung
durch Worte.  Ausser im metaphorischen Sinn, kann man keine
Abstraktion einer Zeichnung zeichnen, wenngleich wir von abstrakter
Malerei sprechen.  Durch das Zeichnen definiert sich der Mensch als
jemand, der in der Lage ist zu sehen, zu verstehen (zum Beispiel die
unsichtbaren Teile eines Gegenstands, den Einfluss von Licht, wie
Farbe oder Material etwas runder oder heller erscheinen lassen), den
praktischen Kontext eines Gegenstands als entscheidend fuer die
Bedeutung, sowohl des Gegenstandes--real oder imaginaer--, als auch
der Zeichnung anzusehen.  Unterschiedliche Kontexte ermoeglichen
unterschiedliche Arten des Zeichnens.  Kontextlos aehnelt das Zeichnen
dem Babbeln eines Kindes, ist es ein fragmentarischer,
unvollstaendiger Ausdruck.  Vitruvius zeichnete ganz anders als viele
spaetere Architekten.  Kritiker, die ihn mit Le Corbusier und seinen
architektonischen Werken, mit den Architekten des
Post-Strukturalismus und mit den Dekonstruktivisten und den
dekonstruktivistischen Designern verglichen, kritisierten deren
Zeichnungen als haesslich, schlecht oder unangemessen.  Hier ist
Zeichnen kein Wurmfortsatz der Kunst mehr.  Es klagt seine eigene
Rechtfertigung ein.

Wenn wir die praktischen Zusammenhaenge und die grossen Veraenderungen
im Bereich des Designs, das urspruenglich von Sprache gepraegt
wurde--Vitruvius schrieb ein monumentales Werk ueber die
Architektur--ausser acht lassen, ist diese Aussage richtig.  Aber wir
haben es hier mit einem Entwicklungsprozess zu tun: von einem Design,
das von der in Vitruvius’ Werk ausgedrueckten Lebenspraxis gepraegt ist,
ueber ein Design, das der Schriftkultur unterworfen war, bis hin zu
einem Design, das um seine Emanzipation als eine neue Sprache ringt;
mit einer kritischen Komponente und einem konstruktiven Impuls, der
die Welt veraendern moechte.

Design hat viele formale Erfordernisse aus solchen praktischen
Erfahrungen uebernommen, die der Schriftkultur unterworfen waren.
Aber es gibt auch einen grundlegenden Konflikt zwischen Design und
Sprache, und mehr noch zwischen Design und Schriftkultur.  Dieser
Konflikt wurde innerhalb des Designbereichs nie geloest.  Die
Schriftkultur hat der Bildung ihre formativen Strukturen aufgedraengt,
daraus resultierte eine geisteswissenschaftliche Kunsterziehung.  Es
versteht sich von selbst, dass Designer, professionelle und angehende,
die Annahme, dass ihr Handwerk auf das Podest der ewigen Werte der
Schriftkultur gehoben werden muesse, stets abgelehnt haben.  Statt
dazu angehalten zu werden, in konkreten Zusammenhaengen die
Notwendigkeit schriftkultureller Werte aufzuspueren, werden das Design
und die Designausbildung dem traditionellen Mischmasch aus Geschichte,
Sprache, Philosophie, einer Prise Naturwissenschaft und vielen
sonstigen Wahlmoeglichkeiten beigepackt.  Eine eigene Theorie, allein
das Suchen nach einer solchen, wird als frivol verworfen.  Und all
das, was man nur als Intuition bezeichnen kann, wird systematisch
wegerklaert, anstatt gefoerdert zu werden.

Vom Standpunkt der Bildung aus betrachtet, kann man die kuenstliche
Beibehaltung eines auf der Schriftkultur basierenden
Ausbildungsprogrammes fuer Design rechtfertigen, aber der allgemeinere
Rahmen unserer praktischen Erfahrungen hat die Veraenderungen, die das
Design seit seiner Entstehung als Berufsfeld bewirkt hat, laengst
anerkannt.  Der Konflikt zwischen Ausbildung und Anstellung hat dazu
gefuehrt, dass man das Design von Einengungen zu befreien versuchte,
die sich nachhaltig auf sein Wesen auswirkten: Wie koennen wir uns von
den mechanischen Komponenten des Designs (paste-up, rendering,
Modellierung) loesen?  Diese Ansaetze kamen von aussen und waren von der
allgemeinen Dynamik angeregt, die die Veraenderung von der Pragmatik
der Schriftkultur zur Pragmatik jenseits der Schriftkultur bewirkte.
Diese Veraenderung hatte auch neue Design-Werkzeuge zur Folge, die dem
Designer neue Ausdrucksmoeglichkeiten oeffneten: Animation,
Interaktivitaet und Simulation.  Der Designer sah sich ermutigt,
innerhalb seines Gebietes neue Wege zu suchen, die verschiedenen
Moeglichkeiten seiner Taetigkeit auszuloten und seine Erkenntnisse in
neuen Gestaltungsformen auszudruecken.  Der PC und verschiedene
Techniken zur schnellen Erstellung von Prototypen brachten Design und
Ausfuehrung naeher zusammen.  Auch wurden neue Vermittlungsebenen in
den Designablauf eingebaut.


Die Emanzipation

Die Mehrzahl der heute benutzten Gegenstaende entstand entweder im
Zuge der Designrevolution zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts oder als
Folge der Bemuehungen, alltaegliche Gebrauchsgegenstaende im Hinblick
auf ihren Gebrauch in einem neuen praktischen Umfeld neu zu entwerfen.
Vom Telefon zum Fernsehgeraet, vom Auto zum Flugzeug und
Hubschrauber, vom Bleistift zum Fuellfederhalter und
Einwegkugelschreiber, von der Schreibmaschine zum
Textverarbeitungssystem, von der Registrierkasse zum Scanner, vom
Herd zur Mikrowelle--die Liste kann unendlich fortgesetzt
werden--wurde eine neue Welt entworfen und produziert.  Und die
naechste Welt steht schon vor der Tuer, eine Welt mit Robotern,
sprachgesteuerten Maschinen und vernetzten Expertensystemen, die
entweder wir benutzen werden oder die auf die ein oder andere Weise
uns benutzen.  Kohle-, oel- oder gasbetriebene Dampf- und
Kraftmaschinen werden durch kompakte, elektrische oder
elektromagnetische Hochleistungsmotoren ersetzt, die integrierter
Bestandteil der jeweiligen Maschinen sind und die von komplexen
elektronischen Kontrollsystemen ueberwacht werden.

Es gibt kaum etwas aus dem Zeitalter der Schriftkultur, was nicht
durch leistungsfaehigere Alternativen ersetzt und vollkommen anders
strukturiert sein wird.  Wie steht es um die Technologie der
Schriftkultur?  Man kann hier den alten Werbeslogan wiederholen: "Die
Schreibmaschine ist fuer den Fueller, was die Naehmaschine (erinnern Sie
sich noch an die pedalgetriebene Naehmaschine?) fuer die Nadel ist.”
Remington produzierte in den siebziger Jahren des vergangenen
Jahrhunderts die wunderschoene Schreibmaschine Scholes and Glidden.
Man konnte kaum sagen, ob dieses mit bunten, handgearbeiteten Blumen
schmuckvoll verzierte Stueck in ein Buero oder in ein viktorianisches
Arbeitszimmer gehoerte.  Jetzt ist sie ein Museumsstueck.  Vergleichen
wir sie mit einem heutigen Textverarbeitungssystem: Die aeussere Schale
mag den zwei- bis dreijaehrigen Erneuerungszyklus von Hardware
ueberdauern.  Die Leistungsfaehigkeit des Chips wird sich nach dem
Mooreschen Gesetz alle 18 Monate verdoppeln.  Die Software, Herz und
Kopf der Maschine, wird staendig verbessert.  Sie bietet heutzutage
ein Rechtschreibprogramm, enthaelt Woerterbuecher, korrigiert die Syntax
und schlaegt stilistische Veraenderungen vor.  Bald wird sie Diktate
aufnehmen.  Dann wird sie wahrscheinlich ueberholt sein; erstens, weil
der Computer in ein Netzwerk integriert und nach Gebrauch aufgerufen
wird, und zweitens, weil die schriftliche Nachricht fuer den neuen
Kontext nicht mehr angemessen ist.  Diejenigen, die diese etwas
simple Vorhersage bezweifeln, moegen sich einige andere Fragen stellen:
Wo ist das dekorative Tintenfass, wo sind die wunderschoenen Muster
von Faberge und Tiffany?  Wo sind die Fuellfederhalter, die Gestetner
Maschinen?  Wo das Kohlepapier?  Wurden sie ersetzt durch tragbare
Diktiergeraete oder Taschencomputer, durch kleine Miniaturgeraete, in
die ein schnurloses Telefon integriert ist?  Wurden sie ersetzt durch
den Computer, Internet-Browser und das digitale Fernsehen?  Von
Edward Bulwer-Lytton ist der Satz ueberliefert: "Die Feder ist
maechtiger als das Schwert.” Sie wurden zu Museumsstuecken.  Der
Einwegkugelschreiber wurde symptomatisch fuer eine Gesellschaft, die
nicht nur den Kugelschreiber wegwirft, sondern auch die Schrift.

Die Emanzipation des Designs tritt zunaechst auf der strukturellen
Ebene auf.  Man kann einen Brief, ein Manuskript oder einen
Geschaeftsplan mit einem Bleistift schreiben, aber es ist etwas ganz
anderes, dazu eine Schreibmaschine, ein Textverarbeitungsprogramm
oder das Internet zu benutzen.  Die kognitiven Vorgaenge dieser
Taetigkeit--die im Kopf ablaufenden Prozesse--fuehren zu einem jeweils
anderen Ergebnis.  Es gibt kein passives Medium.  In jedem Medium
sind Erwartungshaltungen und Interaktionsmuster gespeichert.  Je
interaktiver ein Vorgang ist, desto staerker veraendert sich der Akt
des Schreibens an sich.  Es gibt Nachrichten, die an eine grosse
Gruppe von Adressaten gerichtet sind.  Zum Beispiel der Mullah, der
vom Turm eines Minaretts das Abendgebet spricht; ein Priester, der
seine Gemeinde anspricht, ein Staatspraesident in einer
Fernsehansprache oder ein Spammer, der Werbemuell im Internet
versendet, der Nachrichten an Millionen von e-mail Adressen schickt.
Jede dieser kommunikativen Handlungen geschieht innerhalb eines
kontextuellen Rahmens, der die Parameter fuer ein Vorverstaendnis setzt.
Dem Grossteil der Menschen sagt das Wort Spammer gar nichts.  Selbst
heute haben 50% der Weltbevoelkerung niemals ein Telefon benutzt.  Und
auch bei 50 Millionen Menschen im Internet bleibt das Netizenship
eher eine Vision.  Design als semiotische, integrative, praktische
Erfahrung ist eine Frage von Kommunikation und Kontext.

Erst Design schuf die Moeglichkeit, eine Nachricht so zu veraendern,
dass sie nicht eine anonyme Gruppe anspricht (die Glaeubigen, die sich
versammelt haben, oder die Mitglieder einer Gesellschaft, die an den
ihr Leben beeinflussenden politischen Entscheidungen interessiert
sind), sondern jedes einzelne Individuum, und dies in einer Form, die
das Interesse am jeweiligen Zustand des Individuums und den Respekt
fuer seinen Beitrag innerhalb eines Systems mit geteilten Aufgaben
widerspiegelt.  Die Semiotik von Gruppen- oder Massenkommunikation
ist grundverschieden von der Semiotik des Pointcasting.  In
technologischer Hinsicht besitzen wir bereits die noetigen
Voraussetzungen fuer diese individualisierte Kommunikation.  Sie
findet aber nicht statt aufgrund der impliziten, auf der
Schriftkultur basierenden Erwartungen hinsichtlich der Funktionsweise
von Kirche, Staat, Bildung, Handel und anderen Institutionen.  Die
Praxis des Designs fordert uns auf, die zentrale Position eines
Verfassers zu ueberdenken.  Im Modell der Schriftkultur erfolgt die
Kommunikation in einem Verhaeltnis eins : viele.  Dieses Modell geht
von einer Hierarchie innerhalb einer Sequenz von Interaktionen aus
(ein Wort wird geaeussert, der Zuhoerer versteht, reagiert, usw.).  In
der industriellen Praxis hat dieses Modell funktioniert.  Durch das
Medium des Fernsehens perfektioniert, erlangte es Globalitaet.  Aber
Skala ist nicht eine Frage von Zahlen.  Wichtiger sind Interaktivitaet,
Intensitaet, effiziente Befriedigung individueller Beduerfnisse und
Erwartungen.  Effizienz bedeutet nicht mehr, wie viele Personen sich
am Ende des Kommunikationskanals befinden, sondern wie viele Kanaele
noetig sind, um wirklich jeden effektiv zu erreichen.  Ein neues
Design kann die Kommunikationsstruktur veraendern und
partizipatorische Elemente einbringen.  Anhaenger der Schriftkultur
verbinden mit dieser Alternative die Form eines computergeschriebenen
Briefs, der mit einer Adressenliste in einer Datenbank verknuepft wird.
Fuer diejenigen, die umzudenken und ihre Ziele neu zu formulieren
bereit sind, heisst Effektivitaet jedoch mehr, naemlich die UEberwindung
der Schriftstruktur.

Die erste Herausforderung liegt darin, die Sprache der Individuen zu
kennen, auf ihre spezifischen Merkmale (kognitiv, emotional,
physisch) zu reagieren und sie persoenlich anzusprechen.  Das fuehrt zu
individualisierten Nachrichten, die gleichzeitig viele Menschen
erreichen, die an aehnlichen Themen interessiert sind (Umwelt, Bildung,
Familie).  Darueber hinaus wird es moeglich, dass mehrere Menschen
gleichzeitig an dem selben Text schreiben, oder der Text einer Person
von einer zweiten durch ein Bild ergaenzt oder mit Animationen,
gesprochenen Worten oder Musik gekoppelt wird.  Bei diesen Formen des
Designs werden Hierarchien abgeschafft, was gleichzeitig zu neuer
Interaktivitaet ermuntert.  Ein Design, das solche Muster menschlicher
Erfahrung anstrebt, muss sich von den Begrenzungen der Sequentialitaet
befreien.  Ein solches Design kann sich nicht mehr dem dualistischen
Denken von Gut und Boese usw. unterwerfen, wie sie oft in Bezug auf
die Form auftritt (Typographie, Layout, Kohaerenz).  Statt dessen
orientiert es sich an Urteilskoordinaten, die von "weniger
angemessen" bis zu "besonders angemessen" reichen.  Nicht mehr in
Stein, Holz oder Metall gemeisselt und gegossen, sondern in einen
weichen Mantel gehuellt (als Software oder als variable,
selbstregulierende Regelmenge), kann das Design sich verbessern, sich
veraendern und seine optimale Form erreichen durch die vielen Beitraege
derjenigen, die ihre Identitaet in der Interaktion mit dem Design
finden.  Der Benutzer kann nach Belieben das Design vollenden, indem
er innerhalb bestimmter gesetzter Grenzen, Form, Farbe, Material,
Oberflaechenbeschaffenheit und sogar die Funktion des Gegenstandes
modifiziert.

Die Kenntnis der Sprache der adressierten Individuen ist noch
tiefgreifender.  Die Sprache des Individuums zu kennen, bedeutet, die
darin verkoerperte Erfahrung zu kennen.  Folglich operiert das neue
Design nicht mehr nur auf der semantischen oder syntaktischen Ebene,
sondern ist pragmatisch orientiert.  Jedes Individuum zu erreichen,
bedeutet, einen Kontext fuer eine praktische Erfahrung erst zu
schaffen: das Lernen, die Teilhabe an politischen Entscheidungen, das
Kunstschaffen, und vieles mehr.  Aber man sollte realistisch bleiben,
auch wenn wir hier gerne Optimismus verbreiten wuerden.  Die ueblichste
praktische Erfahrung besteht darin, an der Verteilung des in diesem
neuen Effizienzrahmen gewonnenen Wohlstands teilzuhaben.  So
entmutigend dies klingen mag, letztlich ist der Konsum, als extrem
individualisierte Taetigkeit, die vielversprechendste Moeglichkeit des
effektiven Pointcasting.  Die Fragen, die von Visionaeren, Innovatoren
und Risikokapitalisten, die alle auf das Internet setzen, heute
gestellt werden, legen diese Schlussfolgerung nicht immer nahe.


Konvergenz und Divergenz

Telekommunikation, Medien und wissenschaftliche Computation
verschmelzen.  Diese Verschmelzung wird durch eine Reihe von Faktoren
hervorgerufen, die alle nach einer Effizienz streben, die einer
Arbeits- und Lebenspraxis auf globaler Ebene entspricht.  Innerhalb
dieser dynamischen Prozesse wirkt das Design als eine Kraft, die aus
der Schriftkultur eine Kultur von vielen nebeneinander bestehenden,
manchmal widerspruechlichen Sprachen macht.  Frueher war ein Hemd
lediglich ein Kleidungsstueck; das T-Shirt wurde zu einem eigenen
Kommunikationsmedium, zu einem Ikon.  Die kommerzielle Seite ist
hierbei ganz offensichtlich.  Zum Beispiel hat jede renommierte
Universitaet einen Vertrag mit einem Hersteller, der mit ihrem Namen
auf wandelnden Litfasssaeulen, auf Ruecken und Baeuchen wirbt.  Das
T-Shirt ersetzt effektiv wortreiche Pressemitteilungen und wird zum
Medium fuer Live-Nachrichten.  Bevor die Operation Desert Storm
ueberhaupt in Gang kam, konnte man auf T-Shirts bereits
Sympathiebekundungen oder Anti-Kriegs-Parolen lesen.  Als der
Basketballspieler Magic Johnson bekannt gab, dass er HIV-positiv sei,
gab es in Los Angeles bereits weniger als 48 Stunden spaeter T-Shirts
mit dem Aufdruck: "We still love you”.

Die blitzschnelle Kommentierung von Ereignissen geht einher mit den
sich heutzutage schnell veraendernden Haltungen und Erwartungen.  Die
Institutionen leiden an Traegheit, sie koennen mit den Veraenderungen
der Zeit nicht Schritt halten.  Die Nachrichten, die ausserhalb der
Medieninstitutionen entstehen und wahrgenommen werden, lesen sich wie
ein Manifest der Unmittelbarkeit, aber zugleich wie ein Zeugnis der
Kurzlebigkeit.  Design ist Ausdruck dieser unmittelbaren Aktualitaet
und dieser Kurzlebigkeit, aber nicht nur auf T-Shirts oder im
Internet.  Haus, Kleidung, Autos, Walkman, sie alle sind in diesen
Rhythmus eingebunden.  Ist Design nun der Grund fuer diese Situation;
oder ist es etwas anderes, das sich durch Design ausdrueckt und zu
dessen Komplizen sich Design macht.  Die kurzlebigen Modetrends, die
staendige Erneuerung von Designentwuerfen, die halbminuetige Komoedie
oder Tragoedie im Werbespot--die dem Rhythmus des Daseins viel naeher
ist, als endlose Fernsehserien--die neue VLSI-Platine, die Sucht nach
alkoholfreiem Designerbier oder fettfreiem Schweinefleisch--all dies
zeigt, dass die Geschwindigkeit der Erneuerungen vom schier
unersaettlichen Appetit unserer kommerziellen Demokratie genaehrt wird.
Die Geschwindigkeit, mit der neue Bilder auf unseren Computern und
Fernsehgeraeten erscheinen, ermoeglicht durch die spezifischen Merkmale
von Technologie und menschlicher Natur, ist wahrscheinlich die
extremste Auspraegung dieses Lebensrhythmus’.  All dies enthusiastisch
oder besorgt zu verzeichnen, ohne die Gruende hierfuer zu verstehen,
wuerde der Absicht dieses Buches zuwiderlaufen.  Der praktische
Kontext fuer hohe Effizienz ist ja zugleich der Kontext fuer eine
allgemein verbreitete Demokratie, die von Produktion zu Konsum
vorangeschritten ist.  Die Antriebskraft hinter diesem Prozess ist die
Moeglichkeit, ja die Notwendigkeit der Emanzipation von allen
erdenklichen bisherigen Zwaengen.  Die Praxis des Designs zeigt, dass
die Emanzipation von Zwaengen nicht zu einem anarchistischen Paradies
fuehrt.  Das Recht zur Teilhabe an menschlichen Erfahrungen aller Art
fuehrt oft genug zu gleichfoermigem und einheitlichem Geschmack und zu
einer allgemein verbreiteten Mittelmaessigkeit.

Im Gegensatz zu den schriftkulturellen Werten will ein davon
befreites Design dem Benutzer nichts aufdraengen, sondern ihn in den
Entscheidungsprozess einbinden.  So wird Design zum Massstab fuer
oeffentliche Intelligenz, oeffentlichen Geschmack und oeffentliches
Interesse.  Design weist auf eine neue Art von Werten hin.  Dieser
Indikator mag nicht immer ein angenehmes Bild von uns und unseren
Prioritaeten zeichnen.  Die aufrichtige Interpretation eines solchen
Indikators kann uns jedoch zu verstehen helfen, warum der
Walkman--der ganz offenbar ein allseits willkommenes Ideal der
Abkapselung verkoerpert--so beliebt ist, warum einige
Modeerscheinungen Erfolg haben und andere nicht, warum bestimmte
Autotypen Zustimmung finden, warum Filme zu wichtigen Themen
Misserfolge werden und warum trotz immer steigender Erwartungen keine
Qualitaetssteigerung zu erwarten ist.  Jeder Gestaltungsversuch
erreicht eine neue Schwelle.  Der in die Kleidung eingebaute Computer
(wearable computer) ist nur ein weiteres Glied in der Entwicklung,
die Evolution und Revolution miteinander verknuepft.

Effizienz im Design zeigt ein ums andere Mal, dass menschliches
Handeln (Do-it-yourself dominiert auf allen Ebenen des Designs) teuer
und dass Dienstleistungen in Industrienationen gewinnbringender als
Produktion sind.  Wir sollten die Bedeutung dieser Tatsache nicht zu
leicht nehmen.  Denn Design schlaegt eine Bruecke in die Zukunft, und
eine Bruecke in eine Welt mit erschoepften Rohstoffen, einer zerstoerten
Umwelt und existentieller Mittelmaessigkeit gibt keinerlei Anlass zu
Optimismus.  Rolle und Einbindung des Menschen zu reduzieren,
besonders dann, wenn menschliche Arbeit anstrengend und gefaehrlich
ist, scheint sehr verlockend, wuerde aber in die falsche Richtung
gehen.  Es muessten dafuer neue Energien entdeckt werden, die sich
nachdruecklich von denen des Individuums, das sich ueber seine Rolle
als Benutzer konstituiert, unterscheiden.  Angesichts des Konflikts
zwischen Erwartungshaltungen und Ressourcen kann sich der Designer
oft nicht von der Leitidee der Schriftkultur, naemlich die Natur zu
beherrschen, befreien.  Gluecklicherweise werden durch ein Design, das
sich an einer Ko-Evolution mit der Natur orientiert, neue Impulse
gesetzt.  Das gilt auch fuer das Design von Materialien, die
Charakteristika der menschlichen Intelligenz tragen.

Der inhaerente Gegensatz zwischen den vorhandenen Moeglichkeiten und
den Zielen erklaert die Dynamik des Designs.  Hocheffiziente
Kommunikationsmethoden fuehren zu einer UEbersaettigung an Informationen.
Neue Methoden beim Design fuehren zu einem scheinbaren UEberfluss an
Gegenstaenden und anderen Designerobjekten.  Diese Entwicklung ist
nicht zuletzt dadurch angetrieben, dass individuelle Erwartungen auf
einer Produktionsebene, die hoeher und zugleich billiger ist als die
schriftkulturelle Massenproduktion, erfuellt werden koennen.  Das
Problem einer gleichzeitigen Wahrung von Qualitaet und
Unverfaelschtheit verlangt mehr als nur hohe Massstaebe.
Marktspezifische Faktoren wie etwa Profiterwartungen beeinflussen die
Entscheidungen im Bereich des Designs dahingehend, dass Produkte
entweder uebermaessiges oder aber nur unzureichendes Design erfahren.
Veraenderte Erwartungen in der Lebenspraxis beeinflussen das Design
staerker als den Bereich der Produktion.  Ob die Flexibilitaet der
Designtaetigkeit ausreicht, mit diesen Veraenderungen Schritt zu halten,
haengt nicht nur vom Design ab, sondern auch von der wirtschaftlichen
Gleichung, die aufgehen muss.  Design erreicht grosse Teile der
Weltbevoelkerung.  Diese Tatsache gibt ihm, als Ganzes gesehen, eine
neue soziale Dimension.  Angesichts seiner Moeglichkeit, sich auf
individuelle Erwartungen einzustellen, ohne dabei auf Schriftkultur
zurueckgreifen zu muessen, liegt darin eine ungeheure Verantwortung.
Ob sich Designer dessen bewusst und in der Lage sind, dieser
Verantwortung gerecht zu werden, ist eine andere Frage.


Der neue Designer

Design vermittelt zwischen den Beduerfnissen der Lebenspraxis und den
Moeglichkeiten von Natur und Gesellschaft.  Es verkoerpert Erwartungen
und geplante Veraenderungen und die Notwendigkeit, sich im
Grenzbereich zwischen dem Gegebenen, dem Gewuenschten oder dem
Erwarteten zu bewegen.  Die Sprache des Designs beinhaltet
Antizipationen und die Erwartung von Dauerhaftigkeit.  AEsthetische
Strukturierung, die in unserer Kultur verwurzelt ist und durch
Technologie unterstuetzt wird, beeinflusst die Effizienz von
Designobjekten.  Die expliziten Erwartungen werden gegen die
impliziten Antizipationen abgewogen.  Diese aesthetische Dimension
uebersetzt aus den vielen Sprachen der Lebenspraxis in die Sprache des
Designs und uebertraegt sie auf die vielfaeltigen Moeglichkeiten,
Produkte, Veranstaltungen, Materialien oder Interaktionen zu
gestalten.

Man sollte den Prozess des Designs aus moeglichst vielen verschiedenen
Perspektiven betrachten: von der ersten Skizze zu den vielen
Varianten des Konzepts; eines ersetzt das andere; vielerlei
Entscheidungen werden getroffen.  Design aehnelt einem natuerlichen
Auswahlprozess: eine Loesung hebt eine andere auf, in einem
fortlaufenden Prozess, bis schliesslich ein relativ passendes Ergebnis
vorliegt.  Dies ist das memetische Prinzip, das erfolgreich in auf
genetischen Algorithmen basierender Design-Software uebersetzt wurde.
Frei von jeglichen Regeln, wie sie die Schriftkultur fordert, und
befreit von dualistischem Denken (der klaren Unterscheidung zwischen
gut und boese, richtig und falsch) bewegt sich der Designer in einem
Kontinuum von Antworten auf Fragen, die sich ihm waehrend des
Designprozesses stellen.  Die Tatsache, dass verschiedene Loesungen
miteinander konkurrieren, verleiht dem Design eine dramatische Note.
Die prinzipielle Offenheit verweist auf prinzipielle Veraenderung.  Es
besteht ein offenkundiger Unterschied zwischen dem Design in einem
Kontext, der von einer Identitaet zwischen Koerper und Maschine ausgeht,
und dem Design im Bereich des digitalen menschlichen Klonens.
Design im Bereich der Neurobionik und des Cyberbody konnte nur aus
dem pragmatischen Kontext jenseits der Schriftkultur entstehen.

Und dennoch, wenn man die Wahl haette zwischen einer Greek
TempleSchreibmaschine aus dem Jahr 1890 und einem handelsueblichen
Textverarbeitungssystem, inkompetent entworfen und in eine billige
Plastikumhuellung gesteckt, waere die Entscheidung nicht leicht.  Das
erstere ist ein Gegenstand von ausgemachter Schoenheit, das ein Ideal
zum Vorschein bringt, dem wir nicht mehr folgen koennen.  Seine
Einzigartigkeit machte ihn unerschwinglich fuer viele, die ihn
benoetigt haetten.  Hinter oder in einem Textverarbeitungssystem stehen
wie hinter jedem digitalen Verarbeitungssystem standardisierte
Komponenten.  Die ganze Maschine ist ein Ensemble aus Modulen.  Ein
Programm ist die Urform fuer alle existierenden
Textverarbeitungsprogramme.  Der Rest ist schmueckendes Beiwerk.  Hier
liegt der Kern des Problems: maximale Effizienz zu erreichen auf der
Erkenntnis, dass Rohstoffe und Energie allein bedeutungslos sind, wenn
nicht das schoepferische, auf die Selbstkonstituierung ausgerichtete
Bewusstsein (Mind) etwas aus ihnen macht.

Design erscheint bisweilen als der Suendenbock fuer Verschwendung und
fuer Geringschaetzung gegenueber der Umwelt oder fuer mangelnde
Anteilnahme am Schicksal derer, deren Arbeitsplaetze durch Maschinen
ersetzt werden.  Dass die Menschen geradezu suechtig nach den
Designerobjekten werden--nach Fernsehen, elektronischen Geraeten,
Designermode, Designerdrogen--wird dabei oft vergessen.  Oder aber
das Design wird idealisiert, weil es die Effizienz der Lebenspraxis
steigert oder weil es unserer Sucht nach Mehr zu einem niedrigeren
Preis ein Qualitaetsbewusstsein entgegensetzt.  Aber nicht die Handlung,
sondern die handelnden Menschen verleihen der Kritik oder der
Idealisierung Bedeutung.  Damit sind wir bei der Person des Designers
und seinem Selbstverstaendnis jenseits der Schriftkultur.

Designer beherrschen bestimmte Bereiche der visuellen Welt.  Einige
visualisieren Sprache: Schriftdesigner, Graphiker, Buchdrucker;
andere entwerfen im dreidimensionalen Raum als Produktdesigner,
Architekten oder Ingenieure.  Fuer wieder andere ist Design etwas
Dynamisches--Mode wird erst durch ihre Traeger lebendig; Gaerten
durchlaufen jahreszeitliche Veraenderungen, Jahr um Jahr; mit
Spielzeug wird gespielt, und Animation ist Design mit einer eigenen
Seele (anima).  Die grosse Vielfalt von Gestaltungsmoeglichkeiten ist
nur wenigen Prinzipien unterworfen.  Es gelten Unverfaelschtheit,
Folgerichtigkeit und Harmonie, Zweckdienlichkeit und natuerlich
aesthetische Qualitaet.  Aber wenn man Design in seiner Gesamtheit
untersuchen wollte, wuerde man zuallererst feststellen, dass es kein
Alphabet, keine Richtlinie fuer richtiges Design und keine allgemein
gueltigen Bewertungskriterien gibt.  Schriftkultur funktioniert von
oben nach unten (Lexik, Grammatik und Phonetik liegen fest und sind
zu befolgen).  Design waehlt die umgekehrte Richtung, aus dem
konkreten Zusammenhang heraus hin zu neuen Antworten, so dass der
Erfahrungsschatz staendig erweitert wird und unerschoepflich scheint.

Die Menschen wollen, dass ihre Umwelt (Kleidung, Schuhe, Moebel,
Schmuck, Parfueme, Inneneinrichtung, Spiele, Landschaft) so gestaltet
wird, dass sie im Einklang mit ihrem eigenen Design steht.  Wie im
Prozess des Designs gibt es auch hier Modelle: Prominente, entworfen
fuer den oeffentlichen Konsum.  Darueber hinaus versucht man, sein Leben
als Design, als eine Folge von gestalteten Ereignissen, zu leben:
Geburt, Taufe, Erstkommunion, Examina (an verschiedenen Punkten einer
durchgestalteten Ausbildung), Verlobung, Hochzeit, Geburtstage,
Befoerderungen, Pensionierung, Beerdigungen und Kriege.  Als
gestaltete Erfahrung mit einer Vielzahl von Vermittlungen kann das
Leben sehr effizient, muss aber (was die Qualitaet betrifft) nicht
gleichzeitig ertragreich sein.  Das gilt fuer jegliche
Designtaetigkeit--Produkte, Materialien, Veranstaltungen.  Sie
schaffen neuen Komfort, aber sie nehmen dem Menschen auch einige der
Herausforderungen, anhand derer er seine Persoenlichkeit entfaltet.

Die Beziehung zwischen Herausforderungen--Beduerfnisse zu befriedigen
und immer hoeheren Erwartungen zu entsprechen--und der Entfaltung der
Persoenlichkeit ist kompliziert.  Jede Taetigkeit weist neue Aspekte
eines Individuums auf.  Die Persoenlichkeit vereint alle diese Aspekte
und bringt sie gemeinsam mit biologischen und kulturellen Merkmalen
in die nicht endenden Begegnungen mit neuen Situationen und Menschen
ein.  Jenseits der Schriftkultur wird der Schwerpunkt vom
Aussergewoehnlichen auf das Durchschnittliche verlagert, so dass
Erwartungen entstehen, die sich jeder leisten kann.  Das befoerdert
den staendigen Wunsch nach Neuem, foerdert aber nicht gerade das
Aussergewoehnliche.  Meistens tritt der Designer im gestalteten Produkt,
Material oder Ereignis gar nicht in Erscheinung (nicht einmal sein
Name).  Es interessiert niemanden, wer den Walkman, den Computer, die
Bodenstation oder neue Materialien entworfen hat, welcher Designer
die Designerjeans, Designerkleider, Designerbrillen,
Designerturnschuhe, die Pauschalreisen oder die Olympischen Spiele
entworfen hat.  Es interessiert niemanden, wer die Internetseite
gestaltet hat, ob sie nun Schauplatz zahlreicher Interaktionen oder
nur Selbstdarstellung ist.  Namen werden verkauft und aufgedruckt,
allein wegen ihres Wiedererkennungswertes.  Es interessiert niemanden,
ob die Person hinter dem Namen wirklich existiert, solange sich der
Name gut vermarkten laesst auf einem Markt, auf dem die gleiche Tasche,
die gleiche Uhr, der gleiche Turnschuh oder die gleiche Brille unter
verschiedenen Markennamen verkauft werden.

Man muss dies im Zusammenhang der allgemeinen Beziehungslosigkeit
sehen.  Nur wenige Menschen wollen wirklich wissen, wer ihre Nachbarn
oder Mitarbeiter sind, und noch weniger, wer all die anderen
Namenlosen sind, die an dem gewuenschten UEberfluss oder an der
oekologischen Selbstzerstoerung teilhaben.  Die Schriftlosigkeit
bereitet diesen durch die Schriftkultur bestimmten verschwommenen
menschlichen Beziehungen ein Ende.  Alle Mittel, durch die wir die
neuen praktischen Erfahrungen vollziehen werden, binden uns in die
Transparenz der Schriftlosigkeit ein.  Daraus ergibt sich eine
vollstaendigere Integration des einzelnen in die gemeinsamen
Informationsdatenbanken, die das Profil unserer kommerziellen
Demokratie zeichnen.  Mit jedem Schritt heraus aus dem privaten
Bereich--um unseren Arzt oder Anwalt aufzusuchen, um ein Paar Schuhe
zu kaufen, ein Haus zu bauen, eine Reise anzutreten, im Internet nach
Informationen zu suchen--werden wir transparenter, wird unser Leben
zunehmend Teil des oeffentlichen Lebens.  Aber Transparenz im
Wettbewerbsleben (Wirtschaft, Politik oder Wissen) bringt die
Menschen nicht unbedingt naeher zusammen.  Wann immer wir neue
Moeglichkeiten feiern, sollten wir nicht vergessen, was mit ihnen
verloren geht.


Virtuelles Design

Design ist das Arbeiten mit und Bearbeiten von Zeichen.  Es vollzieht
sich in einem experimentellen Kontext, der sich vom Gegenstand, von
Unmittelbarkeit und Ko-Praesenz entfernt hat.  Manche glauben, Design
habe sich vom Realen entfernt, dabei sind Zeichen so real wie nur
irgend etwas.  Wenn der Designer seinen Bereich bis in die aeussersten
Grenzen auslotet, dann bewegt er sich in einer unglaublich reichen
Phantasiewelt.  Man kann eine Unterwasserstadt entwerfen, ein
kugelfoermiges Haus, das man von Ort zu Ort rollen kann, alle
moeglichen Apparate, Textilien so duenn wie Gedanken oder so dick wie
Baumrinde oder Gummireifen.  Man kann einen Computer entwerfen, den
man in die Kleidung integriert, neue intelligente Materialien, sogar
neue Menschen.  Hat sich die Vorstellungskraft einmal neuen
menschlichen Unternehmungen geoeffnet--dem Leben auf dem Meeresboden,
dem Tragen ungewoehnlicher Textilfasern, der Kommunikation mittels der
Kleidung, die man traegt, Begegnungen mit neuen gentechnisch
entwickelten Menschen--dann ist der virtuelle Raum als Spielwiese
offen.  Ob der virtuelle Raum nun durch Zeichnungen, Diagramme, Bild-
und Geraeuschkollagen, kuenstliche Traeume, Happenings oder digitale
Verkoerperung der virtuellen Realitaet erschlossen wird, in jedem Fall
ist er nicht mehr gebunden an die Zwaenge der Schriftkultur und
beinhaltet neue, vor allem synaesthetische Sprache.  Wenn also Design
ein Zeichen ist, das auf die praktische menschliche Erfahrung
gerichtet ist, dann geht die Gestaltung des virtuellen Raums einen
Schritt weiter, in die Welt des Meta-Zeichens.  Diese UEberlegungen
richten sich auf eine Welt, in der sich der Mensch von den
charakteristischen Strukturen der Schriftkultur befreit hat.

In der virtuellen Welt ist die Sequentialitaet der Schriftsprache
durch den besonderen Konfigurationskontext aufgehoben.  Gegenseitige
Beziehungen zwischen Objekten sind nicht mehr linear, da ihre
Beschreibung nicht mehr auf dem reduktionistischen Ansatz beruht.  Es
handelt sich hier um ein Universum, das bewusst vage bleibt und auf
eine Logik der Vagheit zurueckgreift.  Im virtuellen Raum beziehen
sich Selbstkonstituierung und persoenliche Identifikation nicht mehr
auf kulturelle Bezugspunkte, die schriftkultureller Art sind, sondern
auf eine sich veraendernde Selbstreferenz.  Die Begriffe sind wir
selber.  Versuche, herauszufinden, wie sich ein Mensch ohne Sprache
entwickelt, koennten durchgespielt werden als Erfahrung eines Menschen,
dessen Verstand eine Art tabula rasa im Virtuellen ist.  Dass dieses
Experiment sich aus der Praxis des Designs ergibt und nicht aus einem
biologischen Zufall (ein Kind, das unter Tieren aufwaechst und keine
Sprache und Zivilisationsformen entwickelt), ist hier in sofern
relevant, als dass das Fehlen von Sprache nur mit Blick auf Folgen fuer
die Lebenspraxis untersucht werden kann.

Im Grunde genommen ist die gesamte Praxis des Designs virtueller
Natur.  Von den vielen entworfenen Bildern des Designers werden nur
wenige Wirklichkeit.  Was dem einen oder anderen Bild zur Umsetzung
verhilft, ergibt sich aus konzeptuellen Abhaengigkeiten innerhalb
bestimmter pragmatischer Gegebenheiten.  Das Betrachten fliegender
Voegel fuehrt nicht gleich zum Design eines Flugzeugs und das
Betrachten von Fischen nicht gleich zum Entwurf eines U-Boots.  Gewiss
sind viele Formen des Designs aus dem Wissen entstanden, dass wir in
der Begegnung mit der Natur erwerben.  Aber sehr viel mehr ergeben
sich aus dem Menschen selbst.  Kein Vorbild in der Natur koennte zum
Computer hinfuehren oder gar zur Entwicklung von Molekuelen,
Materialien und Maschinen, die sich selber reparieren, oder zu
virtuellen Welten, in denen man komplizierte Faehigkeiten erwirbt und
erprobt.  Das Design jenseits der Schriftkultur greift hauptsaechlich
auf die kognitiven Ressourcen des Menschen zurueck.  Nahezu jede
Erfahrung und Taetigkeit in diesem neuen pragmatischen Umfeld ist auf
den Computer bezogen und durch ihn verbreitet.

Das Design als Hauptfaktor des Wandels, der von der Produktions- zur
Dienstleistungsgesellschaft fuehrte, hat eine Differenzierung der
Ausdrucksund Kommunikationsmittel bewirkt und unsere Einstellung
gegenueber der Rolle der Repraesentation und gegenueber Werten
beeinflusst.  Schnelle und vielfaeltige Datenverarbeitung unterstuetzt
die Entwicklung elektronischer Datenspeicherung und elektronischer
Recherche, die die Printmedien ergaenzen und schrittweise ersetzen.
Wenn im gesellschaftlichen Leben Repraesentation durch individuelle
Taetigkeit und durch die Militanz von Interessengruppen ersetzt wird,
dann diffundiert Politik in das Privatleben oder wird von
Interessengruppen vereinnahmt, die sich der Loesung kurzfristiger,
sich stetig veraendernder Probleme widmen.  Das in der Schriftkultur
verankerte Autoritaetsdenken geht in eine schillernde Autoritaet der
individuellen Entscheidung ueber.

Eine Welt des Designs, in dem alles dem Design
unterliegt--Gegenstaende, Umwelt, Materialien, Nachrichten und Bilder
(einschliesslich der Bilder, die wir von uns selbst machen)--, ist
eine Welt mit vielen Moeglichkeiten, aber wenig Sinn fuer Werte.  In
dieser Welt hat man die Freiheit, zu waehlen und Dinge ad infinitum
neu zu gestalten.  Alles, was unter diesen pragmatischen Bedingungen
entsteht, verkoerpert Erwartungen, die wir mit einer Lebensform
jenseits der Schriftkultur verbinden.  Nicht mehr der Gegenstand
dominiert.  Der beeindruckende mechanische Maschinenpark der
Industriegesellschaft ist heute schon Museum.  Im Gegensatz dazu sind
die neuen Gegenstaende idiotensicher (wohlwollender heisst das
"benutzerfreundlich") und darin vielleicht Ausdruck einer allgemeinen
Permissivitaet, die keinen disziplinierten und beherrschten Umgang mit
Produkten mehr kennt.

Das Design wirkt sich auch auf unsere Wahrnehmung von Wirklichkeit
und Fakten aus, indem es das Imaginaere, das Virtuelle und das
Meta-Zeichen in den Vordergrund treten laesst.  Fakten werden durch
ihre Darstellungen und durch Darstellung der Darstellungen ersetzt,
und zwar in unendlicher Kette solange, bis das eigentliche Objekt in
Vergessenheit geraten ist.  Die positivistische Haltung gegenueber der
Welt und der Erfahrung wird durch einen Rahmen relativistischer
Interaktionen ersetzt, die von Bildern und Geraeuschen (auch von Laerm)
beherrscht werden.  Bildtechnologien oeffnen jedem den Zugang zum
Zeichnen, so wie die Schrift jedem zugaenglich war, der in ihr erzogen
wurde.  Der Photoapparat, der mit Hilfe von Licht auf Film malt, die
elektronische Kamera, die Fernsehkamera, der Scanner und der
Digitizer sind alles Zeichenmittel und Mittel fuer die Herstellung und
Verarbeitung von Bildern in jeder nur denkbaren Hinsicht.  Eine
Tonkomponente kann problemlos hinzugefuegt werden und die
Ausdruckskraft der Bilder erhoehen.  Und Interaktivitaet als Teil der
Designpraxis garantiert die neue Dimension der permanenten
Veraenderbarkeit.  Natuerlich verwendet auch die Schriftkultur das
Design, um ihr eigenes Programm zu festigen.  Weniger offensichtlich
ist, dass sich dabei die schriftkulturelle Praxis selbst veraendert.
Die Schriftkultur ist bekanntlich jene Zivilisationsform, die mit der
Entwicklung der Schrift auch das eine BUCH schrieb, welches in der
Folge wechselnder pragmatischer Kontexte vielfaeltigen
Interpretationen unterzogen wurde.  Aber eine Schriftkultur, die sich
den Mitteln einer Zivilisation jenseits der Schriftkultur ueberlaesst,
insbesondere denen des Designs, fuehrt zu einer Vielzahl, einer
unendlichen Zahl von Buechern, die sich an individuelle Leser oder
kleine Gruppen von Lesern richten, deren Interpretation
moeglicherweise darin besteht, dass man sie ungelesen ins Buchregal
stellt.  Von dieser Situation moegen wir heute noch weit entfernt sein,
aber die Dynamik der derzeitigen Veraenderungen weist in eben diese
Richtung.

Im Internet naehern wir uns einer qualitativ anderen Form menschlicher
Interaktion.  Design ist auf mannigfaltige Weise darin eingebunden:
DFUEProtokolle, Hypertext, Layout von Text und Bild, multimediale
Strukturen.  Aber kein einzelner Designer, keine Firma (nicht einmal
die Institution der nationalen Verteidigung, die die Vernetzung
nachhaltig unterstuetzt) kann fuer sich beanspruchen, dieses neue
Medium entworfen und gestaltet zu haben.  Viele haben, oft unbewusst,
dazu beigetragen mit ihren Entwuerfen, die sich ohne das bewusste
Wollen ihrer Autoren in das Grosse und Ganze einfuegten, dessen
Aussehen und Funktionieren (oder Scheitern) niemand vorhersagen
konnte.  Alle diese Bilder veraenderten sich jaehrlich, stuendlich und
werden sich auch in absehbarer und vermutlich unabsehbarer Zukunft
veraendern.

Nehmen wir beispielsweise DFUE- (Datenfernuebertragungs-) Protokolle.
Sie sind das Gegenprinzip zur Schriftkultur.  Ein richtig
geschriebenes Wort wird zerlegt, in einzelne Pakete aufgeteilt, die
einen einzigen Buchstaben (oder nur einen Teil davon) transportieren.
Diese Pakete erhalten Informationen ueber den Zielort, aber nicht
ueber den einzuschlagenden Weg. Wenn diese Pakete ihren jeweils
eigenen Weg genommen haben, werden sie am Zielort wieder
zusammengesetzt.  Um jedoch wieder ein vollstaendiges Wort zu ergeben,
muessen sie je nach Beschaffenheit weiter verarbeitet werden.  Das hat
gar nichts mehr mit dem Zentralismus und der Sequentialitaet der
Schriftkultur zu tun, und im uebrigen wird jede Art von
Information--Bilder, Toene oder Bewegungen--auf die gleiche Weise
behandelt.  Viele andere Merkmale einer von Schriftkultur
beherrschten Pragmatik eruebrigen sich in dieser Welt dynamischer
Verknuepfung auf aehnliche Weise: die formalen Sprachregeln,
Determinismus, dualistische Logik.  Verteilte Ressourcen fuehren zu
verteilten Aktivitaeten.  Ein unvorstellbarer Parallelismus sichert
die Vitalitaet einer exponentiell steigenden Zahl und Art von
Transaktionen.  Das Design wird wie alle anderen Formen der Praxis
global.

Natuerlich stehen wir erst am Anfang.  Verkehrs-, Kommunikations- und
Energieversorgungsnetzwerke wurden entwickelt, lange bevor es
Computer und digitale Datenverarbeitung gab.  Doch in einer Welt, in
der die Bedeutung der kognitiven Ressourcen des Menschen alle anderen
Ressourcen in den Schatten stellt und in der wir den globalen
Effizienzerwartungen der Menschheit entsprechen muessen, ist die
Vernetzung von Gehirnen nicht mehr nur ein evolutionaerer Aspekt des
Designs, sondern ein revolutionaerer Schritt.  Alle oben genannten
Netzwerke koennen zu einem einzigen, allumfassenden Netzwerk der
Menschheit zusammengefasst werden.  Ihr Potential, das ueber die
Funktion als Transportmittel fuer Nachrichten, Elektrizitaet, Gas oder
Personen hinausgeht, wird nicht einmal im Ansatz ausgeschoepft.  Die
integrative Kraft des Designs wird dem Begriff der Konvergenz, die
sich heute auf die Integration von Telekommunikation, Medien und
Computern bezieht, eine Dimension verleihen, die diese Komponenten
weit uebersteigt.  Der Netizen--der Buerger (Citizen) der digital
vernetzten Welt--ist das Ergebnis unserer Selbstkonstituierung in
einer Praxis, die auf einem qualitativ neuen Verstaendnis von Design
beruht.



Kapitel 5:


Politik: So viel Anfang war noch nie

Hoelderlins Zeile "So viel Anfang war noch nie" trifft den heutigen
Zeitgeist.  Sie gilt fuer viele Anfaenge: fuer neue Paradigmen in der
Wissenschaft, technologische Entwicklungen, Kunst und Literatur.
Vermutlich aber ist sie am besten auf die Anfaenge im politischen
Leben anzuwenden.  Die politische Landkarte der Welt veraendert sich
schneller denn je.  Es ist gefaehrlich, Ereignisse zu verallgemeinern,
die noch nicht abgeschlossen sind.  Aber wir koennen sie auch nicht
ignorieren, vor allem wenn sie den Umbruch von der Schriftkultur zu
einer Phase jenseits davon dokumentieren.

Diejenigen, die sich mit der Entwicklung und dem Verhalten der
menschlichen Gattung befassen, glauben, dass die kooperative Bemuehung
die Entwicklung der Sprache, wenn nicht ihre Entstehung, erklaert.
Gemeinsame Anstrengung ist auch die Wurzel der Selbstkonstituierung
des Menschen als gesellschaftliches Wesen.  Die gesellschaftliche
Dimension, die mit dem Bewusstsein verwandtschaftlicher Zugehoerigkeit
beginnt und der eine Verantwortung gegenueber Nichtverwandtem folgt,
ist neben der Herstellung von Werkzeugen die Antriebskraft der
intellektuellen Entwicklung der Menschen.  Oder einfacher: die
Begriffe gesellschaftliches Wesen (zoon politikon) und sprechendes
Wesen (zoon phonanta) sind eng miteinander verknuepft.  Aber diese
Verknuepfung deckt das Wesen der gesellschaftlichen und politischen
Erfahrungen der Menschen nicht vollstaendig ab.

Verschiedene Tierarten entwickeln ebenfalls Interaktionsmuster, die
man als gesellschaftlich bezeichnen koennte, ohne dabei jedoch das
hohe kognitive Niveau des homo habilis zu erreichen.  Auch sie
tauschen Informationen aus, hauptsaechlich ueber Gesten, Geraeusche und
biochemische Signale.  Nahrung aufspueren, Gefahr signalisieren und
rudimentaere Formen kooperativer Bemuehungen sind im Tierleben
dokumentiert.  Das macht sie weder zu gesellschaftlichen Wesen, noch
bezeichnen wir die angewandten Mittel als Sprache.  Politik--in ihrer
fruehen Form wie auch in den heutigen Manifestationen--ist eine
bestimmte Menge zwischenmenschlicher Beziehungen, die sich aus dem
bewussten Beduerfnis ergaben, die Praxis der menschlichen
Selbstkonstituierung zu optimieren.  Die Politik ist nicht
gleichzusetzen mit der Rudelbildung von Woelfen, dem Herdentrieb von
Rotwild, oder mit den komplexen Beziehungen in einem Bienenstock.
UEberdies laesst sich Politik nicht allein auf UEberlebensstrategien
reduzieren, denn die sind auch fuer einige Primaten und wahrscheinlich
auch fuer andere Tiere charakteristisch.

Die Struktur, die der Praxis zugrundeliegt, durch die Menschen zu
ihrer Identitaet finden, drueckt sich in menschlichen Handlungen aus, z.
B. dem Herstellen von Werkzeugen, dem Teilen von Nah- oder
Fernzielen und dem Eingehen gegenseitiger Verpflichtungen materieller
oder geistiger Art.  Veraenderungen in den Bedingungen der
Lebenspraxis bewirken Veraenderungen zwischenmenschlicher Beziehungen.
Dass die Skala der menschlichen Welten und somit die Skala der
menschlichen Lebenspraxis sich veraendert, entspricht der Dynamik, in
der sich die Spezies konstituiert.  Die Anfaenge der Landwirtschaft
und die Bildung der vielen Sprachfamilien liegen in einer Zeit, in
der eine kritische Masse erreicht wurde.  An dieser Schwelle war die
synkretistische Interaktion der Menschen bereits in gut abgegrenzten
Mustern der Lebenspraxis verwurzelt.  Der pragmatische
Handlungsrahmen formte das beginnende gesellschaftliche und
politische Leben und wurde wiederum von ihm stimuliert.  Die Politik
ergab sich aus der erhoehten Komplexitaet der menschlichen
Interaktionen.  Die praktischen gesellschaftlichen und politischen
Erfahrungen beziehen sich auf Arbeit, Glauben, natuerliche und
kulturelle Unterschiede, auch auf geographische Faktoren, insofern
sich einige Formen der menschlichen Erfahrung aus den Bedingungen der
Umwelt ergaben.  Daher ist, historisch gesehen, die Politik eng an
das wirtschaftliche Leben, an Religion, Rassenzugehoerigkeit oder
ethnische Identitaet, geographische Faktoren, Kunst oder Wissenschaft
gebunden.

Die der menschlichen Praxis zugrundeliegende Struktur, die das
Beduerfnis nach Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur bestimmte,
determinierte auch das Beduerfnis nach den angemessenen Ausdrucks-,
Kommunikations- und Bedeutungsmitteln.  Dies zeigt sich in der
Politik noch deutlicher, da sie in einen auf Schriftlichkeit
basierenden Rahmen eingebettet ist.  Folglich sollten sich, sobald
sich bestimmte pragmatische Umstaende veraendern, auch Wesen, Mittel
und Ziele der Politik veraendern.


Die Permissivitaet der kommerziellen Demokratie

Der Zustand der Politik in einem pragmatischen Rahmen von
Nichtsequentialitaet, nichtlinearen funktionalen Abhaengigkeiten,
Nichtdeterminismus, dezentralisierten, nichthierarchischen
Interaktionsformen und beschleunigter Dynamik, extremem
Wettbewerbsdruck--d. h. in einem Rahmen jenseits der
Schriftkultur--entzieht sich gegenwaertig jeglicher Bestimmung.  In
Fluss beschreibt die derzeitige politische Praxis angemessen.  Wir
erleben einen Konflikt zwischen einer Politik, die in einem immer
noch auf Schriftlichkeit basierenden pragmatischen Rahmen verankert
ist, und einer Politik, die von Kraeften geformt wird, die ueber den
Praxisrahmen der Schriftkultur hinausdraengen.  Dieser Konflikt wirkt
sich auf den gegenwaertigen Zustand der Politik und das politische
Handeln aus.  Er wirkt sich auf alles aus, was mit dem
Generationenvertrag und seiner Umsetzung zusammenhaengt: auf
Bildungswesen, Demokratisierung, auf die Praxis der Justiz-,
Verteidigungsund Sozialpolitik sowie die internationalen Beziehungen.

Die die gegenwaertigen politischen Erfahrungen betreffenden
Veraenderungen sind von einer starken Dynamik erfasst, die den Umbruch
von einer auf Industrie gruendenden Volkswirtschaft zu einer globalen
informationsverarbeitenden Dienstleistungsgesellschaft betreibt.
Damit einher geht der UEbergang von der durch Mangel gekennzeichneten
Wirtschaft (in der gehortet und gespart wird) zu grossen, integrierten,
kommerziellen Wirtschaftsstrukturen mit freiem Zugang zu (oder gar
mit Anspruch auf) Konsum und Wohlstand.  Diese Wirtschaftsform nimmt
Einfluss auf das Individuum, das nicht mehr Selbstbeherrschung oder
Verzicht, sondern die Permissivitaet der kommerziellen Demokratie uebt.
Folglich reagiert man auf politische und gesellschaftliche Problemen
mit epikureischer Lebensweise, die in gar nicht allzu ferner
Vergangenheit den Reichen und Maechtigen vorbehalten war: Rueckzug aus
dem oeffentlichen Leben, Hingabe an die Lust des Konsums, der
Unterhaltung, des Reisens und des Sports.  Die Politik selbst wird,
wie Aldous Huxley es in seiner Beschreibung der Schoenen neuen Welt
vorhersagte, zur Unterhaltung oder zu einem weiteren
Wettbewerbsfaktor, nicht so weit entfernt vom Geist und Buchstaben
der Boerse, des Auktionshauses oder des Spielkasinos.

Die politische und gesellschaftliche Teilhabe an der permissiven
Demokratie ist in vielen Formen des Aktivismus kanalisiert, die alle
eine Akzentverlagerung von einer autoritaetsverhafteten Politik hin zu
groesserer Wahlfreiheit ausdruecken.  Die neuen, die Interaktivitaet
betonenden elektronischen Medien kennzeichnen die Abkehr von einem
positivistischen Pruefen von Tatsachen (das aus der Wissenschaft
abgeleitet wurde und sich auf das gesellschaftliche und politische
Leben erstreckte), zu eher relativistischen Erwartungen von einer
erfolgreichen Darstellung in oeffentlichen Meinungsumfragen, in
politischen Festakten und in dem Bild, das wir uns von uns selbst und
anderen machen.  Die Macht der Medien ist laengst schon groesser als die
der Politik.

Damit ist der Prozess noch nicht erschoepfend beschrieben.  Aber wir
erkennen doch, wie bestimmte Formen des Aktivismus--von
(feministischen, ethnischen und sexuellen) Emanzipationsbewegungen
bis zu neuen Interessengruppen, die sich ueber Herkunft, Lebensstil
oder ein bestimmtes Engagement definieren--Politik in ihrer aelteren
und neueren Form zur Befoerderung ihrer eigenen Programme betreiben.
Offenheit, Toleranz, das Recht auf Experimente, Individualismus,
Relativismus sowie bestimmte Interessengruppierungen sind alle ihrem
Wesen nach insofern illiterat, als sie die strukuralen Merkmale der
Schriftkultur ablehnen und erst in einem Umfeld jenseits der
Schriftkultur moeglich wurden.  Einige dieser Bewegungen sind immer
noch vage konturiert, sind jedoch Teil der politischen Tagesordnung.
Die Schriftkultur bezieht sich bei ihrer Suche nach Argumenten fuer
ihr eigenes UEberleben haeufig auf Gruende, die aus Erfahrungen
hervorgingen, die sie verneinen.

Der Einfluss neuer praktischer Erfahrungen der Selbstkonstituierung
ueber digitale Netzwerke hat diese Erfahrungen schon zu Alternativen
gemacht, ungeachtet dessen, wie begrenzt die Einbindung eines
Individuums in sie ist.  Aus der Interaktion im einzig uns bekannten
unzensierten Medium gewinnt eine andere politische Erfahrung an
Gestalt.  Hier zaehlen nicht anonyme Waehler, die zu Mehrheiten ohne
sonderliche Wirkung zusammengeschlossen werden, sondern Individuen,
die bereit sind, sich an konkreten Entscheidungen zu beteiligen und
in den von ihnen gebildeten virtuellen Wahlgemeinschaften an der
politischen Maschinerie teilhaben, die den naechsten bedeutungslosen
Praesidenten hervorbringt.  Das fuehrt zu einer anderen politischen
Dynamik, die sich auf das Individuum konzentriert, zu effizienteren
Formen praktischer politischer Taetigkeit.  Es gibt in dieser Hinsicht
keine Wunder zu vermelden.  Aber zweifellos darf das Internet den
Fehlschlag des Versuchs von 1991, die politische Uhr in Russland
zurueckzudrehen, und einen Einfluss auf Ereignisse in China, Osteuropa
und Suedamerika fuer sich verbuchen.


Wie ist es dazu gekommen?

Rueckblickend koennen menschliche Beziehungen durch die ablesbaren
Wiederholungsmuster beschrieben werden.  Unterschiede in den
Erfahrungen der Selbstkonstituierung treten unter dem Druck hoeherer
Effizienzerwartungen auf.  Beziehungen mit einer politischen
Komponente, also mit gemeinsamen Anstrengungen und mit gemeinsamem
Ertrag und gemeinsamer Verantwortung, sind seit der synkretistischen
Phase der menschlichen Taetigkeit belegt.  In dem durch
Unmittelbarkeit gekennzeichneten synkretistischen pragmatischen
Handlungsrahmen gibt es keine politische Dimension.  Die politische
Identitaet beginnt--wie jede andere Form der menschlichen
Selbstkonstituierung--mit dem Bezug auf die Natur: Die Staerksten, die
Schnellsten, die Reaktionsstaerksten werden als Fuehrer anerkannt.  Die
Maechtigsten sind erfolgreich fuer sich selbst.  Dieser Erfolg
uebertraegt sich auf das UEberleben: mehr Nahrung, mehr Nachkommen,
Unverwuestlichkeit, die Faehigkeit, Gefahren zu entkommen.  Sobald man
das Natuerliche vermenschlichte, wurden die Qualitaeten, die einige
Individuen vor anderen auszeichneten, im Bereich der Natur und der
menschlichen Natur anerkannt.  Als Stammeshaeuptlinge, geistige Fuehrer
oder Priester uebernahmen sie politische Funktionen und bestaetigten
die Gruende, die ihnen ihre Autoritaet verliehen hatten.  Mit der Zeit
verloren natuerliche Qualitaeten ihre bestimmende Rolle.  Die
spezifischen menschlichen Merkmale, vor allem intellektuelle
Qualitaeten, kommunikative Faehigkeiten, Management- und
Planungsfertigkeiten wurden immer wichtiger.  Moderne
Politiklehrbuecher gehen auf die natuerlichen Fertigkeiten gar nicht
mehr ein, sondern konzentrieren sich auf die Regierungskunst oder
-wissenschaft, auf politische Gerissenheit und List.

Die Veraenderungen von den partizipatorischen Formen des politischen
Lebens, in dem Solidaritaet wichtiger ist als Unterschiede zwischen
den Menschen, zu den fuer unsere heutige Zeit charakteristischen
Formen der persoenlichen und politischen Abgrenzung voneinander, haben
stattgefunden, weil die menschliche Praxis sie notwendig machte.

Die Politik war und ist nicht das passive Ergebnis dieser
Veraenderungen: Einige hat sie gefoerdert, andere bekaempft.  Der
UEberlebenstrieb hinter den partizipatorischen Formen wurde staendig
neu definiert und fuehrte zu einer anderen Art der Bestaetigung: nicht
nur besser sein als die anderen Gattungen, sondern besser als unsere
Vorgaenger, besser als andere.  Der Wettbewerb verlagerte sich vom
natuerlichen Umfeld--Mensch gegen Natur--in den menschlichen Bereich.
Sobald der Vergleich mit anderen oder die Beurteilung durch andere
etabliert waren, entstand eine Hierarchie.  Die schriftlich
festgehaltene Hierarchie wurde mit dem Entstehen von
Notationssystemen und mehr noch mit dem Beginn der Schrift eine
wichtige Erfahrungskomponente, eines ihrer strukturierenden Elemente.
Die am Hier und Jetzt orientierte Unmittelbarkeit wurde ersetzt
durch einen sich ueber Generationen hinweg erstreckenden und zwischen
verschiedenen Gesellschaften abspielenden Handlungsraum.

Denn solange das menschliche Handeln relativ homogen war, bestand
keine Notwendigkeit zum politischen Delegieren oder zur
Verdinglichung politischer Ziele in Regeln und Organisationen.  Mit
der Diversifikation von Aufgaben wurde Integration erforderlich, zu
der Riten, Mythen, Religion, Verteilen von Pflichten und
Fuehrungsstrukturen beitrugen.  Die Menschen brachten nicht nur mehr
von ihrer Vergangenheit in heute praktische Erfahrungen ein, sondern
sie begannen auch, ihre Bemuehungen aufzuzeichnen und deren
Angemessenheit zu bewerten, und damit auch die Angemessenheit ihrer
eigenen Politik.  Die auf Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und Zukunft
gerichtete Aufmerksamkeit gestattete es ihnen, sich der Unterschiede
zwischen pragmatischen und politischen Erfahrungen und allen anderen
Erfahrungen (Magie, Mythos, Religion) bewusst zu werden.  Unter den
Voraussetzungen einer zentralisierten, synkretistischen Autoritaet war
dies ein schwieriges Unterfangen.  Das Natuerliche, Magische,
Religioese, Logische, Wirtschaftliche und Politische gingen ineinander
ueber.  Praktische Erwartungen erwiesen sich als das eigentlich
kritische Moment.  Das Anflehen unbekannter Maechte um Regen,
Jagderfolg oder Fruchtbarkeit unterschied sich von den Erwartungen,
die hinsichtlich der Einheit von Arbeit und Leben artikuliert wurden.
Zunaechst waren diese Erwartungen unterschiedlich und ungenau.  Sie
wurden zunehmend praeziser, es entstand ein Verantwortungsgefuehl, das
auf greifbaren Ergebnissen und Vergleichen beruhte.

Waehrend die Selbstkonstituierung die Projektion individueller
Merkmale (biologischer, kultureller Art) auf eine gegebene praktische
Erfahrung darstellt, ist die politische Praxis zu einem grossen Teil
eine Projektion von Erwartungen.  In jedem entscheidenden Zeitpunkt
der praktischen Erfahrung wird die vorherige Erwartung weitergegeben,
wenn neue Erwartungen aufkommen.  Entsprechend wird erwartet, dass
eine politische Fuehrergestalt tatsaechlich oder kraft ihrer Autoritaet
natuerliche Qualitaeten, kognitive und kommunikative Faehigkeiten
(Rhetorik) sowie andere Vorzuege aufweist.  Wenn diese Erwartungen in
spezifische Funktionen (Stammeshaeuptling, Richter, Heerfuehrer,
gewaehlter Gesetzgeber oder herausgehobenes Mitglied der Exekutive)
und in politische Institutionen uebergehen, ist die Projektion nicht
mehr die eines Individuums, sondern die Projektion der den
ausgesprochenen Zielen, Mitteln und Werten verpflichteten
Gesellschaft.  Ob tatsaechlich jeder Stammesfuehrer der Schnellste,
jeder Richter der Objektivste, jeder Heerfuehrer der Tapferste oder
jeder Gesetzgeber der Kluegste war, wurde nach ihrer politischen
Anerkennung fast irrelevant.  Dieser Aspekt wird im Kontext der
Schriftkultur bedeutsam.  Er wird entscheidend im UEbergang vom
pragmatischen Rahmen der Schriftkultur zu einem pragmatischen Rahmen,
in dem die Merkmale der Schriftkultur nur hinderlich sind.

Politische Institutionen, die in den Voraussetzungen der
Schriftkultur fest verankert sind, debattieren immer noch darueber, ob
Telekommunikation akzeptabel und Telehandel sicher sei oder ob
Telebanking im nationalen Interesse liege.  Waehrend diese Debatten
andauern und antiquierte Steuergesetze gelten, greifen die neuen
praktischen Erfahrungen in der globalen Wirtschaft.  Sich ausweitende
Netzwerke veraendern das Wesen der menschlichen Transaktionen z. B.
dahingehend, dass immer weniger Menschen waehlen, weil sie wissen, dass
die Funktion dieser Wahlen--naemlich eine (Aus-) Wahl zu
treffen--politisch bedeutungslos ist.  Die Politik muss den Individuen
naehergebracht werden, und diese Notwendigkeit kann nur in Strukturen
verwirklicht werden, die dem Individuum mehr Macht statt einer
sinnleeren Repraesentation geben.

Politische Taetigkeit schuf Normen, Institutionen, Werte und
gesellschaftliches Bewusstsein.  Niemand kann behaupten, dass Politik
eine harmonisierende Taetigkeit ist; das Zusammenleben mit anderen,
das Eingehen von Vertraegen und das begrenzte Verfolgen individueller
Ziele bedeutet, im staendigen Kompromiss zu leben.  Politische
Erfahrungen schaffen in unterschiedlichem Ausmass Faehigkeiten,
Kompromissen Leben und Legitimitaet zu verleihen.  Die Sprache ist das
Blut, das durch die Adern des zoon politikon fliesst.  Wenn sie von
der Schrift gezaehmt ist, steckt diese Sprache ein sehr genaues Gebiet
des politischen Lebens ab.  Der Herzschlag des gebildeten zoon
politikon entspricht einem Lebens- und Arbeitsrhythmus, der von der
Schriftkultur gesteuert wird.  Der beschleunigte Rhythmus, der in
einer neuen Erfahrungsskala notwendig wurde, erfordert die Befreiung
der politischen Sprache von der Schriftkultur und die Partizipation
vieler Spezialsprachen an der politischen Erfahrung.

Es wird kaum ueberraschen, dass von Politikern durch die Generationen
hindurch hohe Sprachfertigkeiten erwartet wurden, auch dann, wenn
sich der Status der Sprache veraenderte.  Ungeachtet der einer
bestimmten Sprache eigenen Moeglichkeiten und der spezifischen Form
der politischen Praxis ist der effektive Gebrauch wirkmaechtiger
Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsmittel unabdingbar.  Sogar
schriftunkundige Koenige oder Kaiser galten im Vergleich zu denen, die
schriftkundig waren, als die besseren Autoren.  Sie diktierten
gewoehnlich einem Schreiber, der den Eindruck weitergab, dass die
Herrscher uebersetzten, was ihnen hoehere Maechte eingaben.  Bestimmte
Buecher wurden politischen Fuehrern zugeschrieben; Siege in Kriegen
wurden ihnen genauso zugeschrieben wie den militaerischen Fuehrern.
Gesetzbuecher trugen ihren Namen, und sogar Wunder wurden ihnen
zugeschrieben, wenn sich die Politik mit Magie und Religion verband
(wobei sie oft das eine gegen das andere ausspielte).  All dies und
vieles mehr sind Projektionen von Erwartungen.

Die spezifischen Erwartungen der Schriftkultur bestaetigen die mit
ihren Merkmalen assoziierten Werte.  Politik, Ideale der Aufklaerung
und die Industrielle Revolution koennen nicht getrennt voneinander
gesehen werden.  Erwartungen der Bestaendigkeit, Universalitaet,
Vernunft, Demokratie und Stabilitaet waren alle Bestandteil der
politischen Erfahrung.  Die Schriftkultur foerderte neue Formen des
politischen Aktivismus und liess neue Institutionen entstehen.  Das
Bewusstsein von Grenzen zwischen Kulturen und Sprachen nahm zu.  Der
Zentralismus setzte sich durch, und Hierarchien--zurueckhaltend oder
heimtueckisch--wurden mit Hilfe des maechtigen Instruments der Sprache
etabliert.  In diesem Kontext umriss die politische Erfahrung ihren
eigenen Bereich und ihre eigenen Effektivitaetskriterien, die sich von
denen in den alten Stadtstaaten oder des Feudalismus unterschieden.
Der Berufspolitiker trat an die Stelle ererbter Macht.  Die Politik
oeffnete sich der Bevoelkerung und bestaetigte Toleranz, Achtung vor der
Person und die Gleichheit aller Menschen vor dem Gesetz.  Politische
Funktionen wurden designiert und politische Institutionen gebildet.
Regeln fuer deren gutes Funktionieren wurden schriftlich fixiert.  Das
Buendnis zwischen Politik und Schriftkultur sollte sich schliesslich in
eine inzestuoese Liebe verwandeln; doch bevor das geschah, mussten sich
politische Erfahrungen in den damaligen Revolutionen zunaechst
endgueltig emanzipieren.

Diese Errungenschaften gebuehrend zu wuerdigen, war nicht leicht.  Sie
wurden auch getruebt durch die aus frueheren politischen Zusammenhaengen
uebernommenen Vorurteile (bezueglich Geschlecht, Rasse, Religion und
Eigentum).  Wir muessen aber anerkennen, dass die politische Praxis
eine entscheidende Rolle dabei spielte, die Effizienz eines
pragmatischen Rahmens zu erhoehen, der die Schriftkultur endgueltig
etablierte.  Damals wurden die Bildung und der Zugang zu ihr in ihrer
politischen Bedeutung erkannt und in Einklang mit den
Effizienzerwartungen verfolgt, die zur Industriellen Revolution
fuehrten.  Der Prozess war alles andere als universell.  Die westliche
Welt uebernahm hier die Vorreiterrolle.  Ihre politischen
Institutionen foerderten Investitionen aller Art, und Erziehung und
Bildung waren solche Investitionen.

Politische Institutionen spiegeln die Lebenspraxis des Buergers wider
und zugleich ihre Lebens- und Arbeitserfahrungen.  Waehrend der
Begriff Analphabetentum wohl zum ersten Mal 1876 in einem englischen
Text auftauchte, betraf dieses Phaenomen 1880 nur ein Prozent der
deutschen Bevoelkerung.  Mit "Heil dem Koenig, heil dem Staat / Wo man
gute Schulen hat!" liess man Koenig und Staat hochleben.  Damals erfand
Thomas Alva Edison die Gluehbirne (1879) Alexander Graham Bell das
Telefon (1876 patentiert), Nikolaus Otto den
Viertaktverbrennungsmotor (1876) und Nikola Tesla den
Wechselstromgenerator (1884).  Aber Leo Tolstoi wusste, als er Krieg
und Frieden schrieb, dass nur ein Prozent aller Russen lesen konnte.
In vielen anderen Teilen der Welt sah es nicht viel besser aus.  Es
war eine Zeit, in der die Alphabetisierung buchstaeblich ein
Instrument der politischen Diskriminierung war.  Auf die Ungebildeten,
die Analphabeten, blickte man veraechtlich herab, ebenso wie auf
Frauen (einigen wurde Lesen, Bildung und Studium untersagt) und
Nationen, die als unwissend und moralisch minderwertig galten
(Russland gehoerte dazu).

Die zunehmende Bedeutung der Wissenschaft und der Gebrauch effektiver
technischer Mittel, die sich in der Beherrschung der Natur zeigten,
beeinflussten das politische Wesen der Staaten und die Beziehungen
zwischen den Nationen.  Rationalitaet war die Grundlage der Legalitaet;
der Staat bekam Prioritaet vor den Individuen--ein unmittelbarer
Ausdruck seiner schriftkulturellen Anlagen.  Regeln galten fuer alle
gleich (es wurde in ein effektives "Alle sind gleich" uebersetzt, was
sich allerdings von den leeren Formeln populistischer Bewegungen
unterschied).  Die Rationalitaet leitete sich aus der Schriftkultur ab.
Effektiv zu sein hiess, die zu beherrschen, die weniger effektiv
waren (Buerger, Gemeinschaften, Nationen).

Die politische Institution ist eine Maschine; eine von vielen im
pragmatischen Rahmen der Industriellen Revolution.  Sie machte immer
nur eine Sache zu einer Zeit, und ein Teil der Maschine musste nicht
unbedingt wissen, was der andere gerade tat.  Zwischen Input und
Output wurde Energie verbraucht, und was herauskam--politische
Entscheidungen, Sozialpolitik, Vorschriften--war die Massenproduktion
von etwas, worueber die Gesellschaft verhandeln konnte: Schmieren
vermindert Reibung.  Parteien wurden gebildet, politische Programme
formuliert und der Zugang zur Macht fuer viele geoeffnet.  Zwei
Voraussetzungen galten: Die Menschen sollten in der Lage sein, ihre
Meinung ueber Themen des oeffentlichen Interesses zu formulieren, und
sie sollten in der Lage sein, den politischen Prozess zu ueberwachen,
womit sie die Verantwortung fuer ihre politischen Rechte uebernahmen.
Diese zwei Voraussetzungen fuehrten zu einem Verstaendnis von
Demokratie und Freiheit, das schliesslich die Grundlage der liberalen
Demokratie wurde.  Sie bestaetigten auch die schriftkulturellen
Erwartungen, dass Demokratie und Freiheit--wie die Schriftkultur
selbst--universell und ewig sind.

Diese Politik schlug sich mit ihren eigenen Waffen.  Diktaturen
(linke und rechte), Nationalismus, Rassismus, Kolonialismus,
katastrophale Kriege und die gleichmachende Mittelmaessigkeit der
Buerokratie haben die grossen Hoffnungen vom Hoehepunkt des
schriftkulturell inspirierten politischen Handelns auf den Tiefpunkt
der heutigen zynischen Indifferenz gebracht.  Statt der Partizipation
der Menschen am politischen Prozess und statt Mitverantwortung sehen
wir den korrupten Sozialstaat mit der allgegenwaertigen hedonistischen
Hingabe an Spass und Unterhaltung.  Die Komplexitaet der politischen
Erfahrung verhindert sogar die symbolische Partizipation der Menschen
an der Regierung.  Freiwillige Arbeit und Wahlen, ein Recht, fuer das
die Menschen mit einer Leidenschaft gekaempft haben, die nur noch
durch ihre jetzige Gleichgueltigkeit uebertroffen wird, haben ihre
Bedeutung verloren.  Es fehlt das Feedback, das die Motivation zur
politischen Mitverantwortung staerken koennte.  Und offenbar hat die
Forderung von Gleichheit und Freiheit einen so kleinen gemeinsamen
Nenner gefunden, dass die Politik nur noch Mittelmaessigkeit verwalten,
nicht aber Exzellenz foerdern kann.  Von allen Funktionen der
nationalen Einheit als Verkoerperung der politischen
Selbstkonstituierung ist scheinbar nur noch die Funktion der
Umverteilung erhalten geblieben.

Individuelle Freiheit, fuer die im Zeichen der Schriftkultur hart
gekaempft wurde, zeigt sich bestenfalls konformistisch und
opportunistisch.  Es ist fraglich, ob der verlorene Gemeinsinn ein
fairer Preis fuer das Recht auf Individualitaet ist.  Millionen von
Menschen, die sich vom politischen Diskurs des Hasses haben verfuehren
lassen (im Faschismus, Kommunismus und Nationalismus und durch
Rassismus und Fanatismus), haben ihre hart erkaempften Rechte
verschwendet, als sie anderen Eigentum, Meinungs-, Glaubens- und
sonstige Freiheiten, Wuerde und schliesslich das Leben nahmen.  Nach
Auschwitz sollte die Politik nicht noch einmal eine Instanz der
Schikane und geistiger und moralischer Verzerrung werden.  Doch sie
wurde es.  Und wir alle wissen, mit welchem Opportunismus wir die
heutigen Tragoedien (Hunger, Unterdrueckung, Krankheit,
Umweltkatastrophen) durch das politische Entertainment vereinnahmen
lassen.

Im Zusammenhang der Skala, die die Schriftkultur kennzeichnete,
entwikkelte sich der Gedanke des Nationalstaats.  Auch heute
versuchen selbst die Nationen, die die politische Integration
betreiben, sich als autarke Einheiten zu festigen.  Vielleicht werden
nationale Grenzen weniger scharf bewacht, aber sie werden als durch
die Schriftkultur definierte Grenzen aufrecht erhalten.  Wenn
Autarkie unerreichbar ist, liegt die Antwort in Expansion.
Ideologische, rassenspezifische, wirtschaftliche und andere Argumente
werden vorgebracht, um die Politik im Krieg mit anderen Mitteln
fortzusetzen.  Die zwei Weltkriege haben die auf Schriftkultur
basierende Politik auf den Hoehepunkt getrieben.  Der Kalte Krieg (die
erste globale Schlacht) hat diese Politik zu ihrer letzten Krise,
jedoch noch nicht ihrem Ende gebracht.


Politische Sprachen

Die praktische politische Erfahrung artikuliert sich im Instrument
der Sprache.  Vollzieht man vergangene politische Erfahrungen nach,
rekonstruiert man auch ihre Sprache(n).  Diese Aufgabe ist fast
unloesbar, weil die Politik mit jedem Aspekt des menschlichen Lebens
verbunden ist: mit Arbeit, Eigentum, Familie, Geschlecht, Religion,
Erziehung und Ausbildung, Ethik und Kunst.  Die Vielfalt der
politischen Erfahrungen entspricht der Vielfalt der pragmatischen
Umstaende, in denen Menschen ihre Identitaet finden.

Der Vielzahl der praktischen Erfahrungen entspricht die Vielzahl der
politischen Sprachen.  Es gibt wohl so viele politische Sprachen, wie
es Formen der Selbstkonstituierung in einer Gesellschaft gibt.  Aber
vor dem Hintergrund dieser Vielfalt steht die Erwartung, dass Wort und
Tat uebereinstimmen oder dass sie zumindest nicht zu weit auseinander
liegen.

Die Vielfalt der politischen Sprachen erweiterte sich erneut, als die
Sprachen des politischen Bewusstseins hinzukamen.  Wo Werte das
Endziel der Politik waren, wurde der Wert der politischen Erfahrung
selbst ein Thema.  Viele politische Projekte wurden auf dieser
selbstreflexiven Ebene verfolgt: Neue Formen der menschlichen
Zusammenarbeit und der politischen Organisation, UEberlegungen zu
Erziehung und Bildung, Vorurteile, Emanzipation und Justiz.  Dies
erklaert auch, warum sich in der Reihenfolge der praktischen
politischen Erfahrungen die Erwartungen nicht gegenseitig aufhoben.
Sie akkumulierten vielmehr als Ausdruck eines Ideals, wobei sie sich
immer vom jeweils letzten erreichten Ziel fortbewegten.  Ohne ein
Verstaendnis fuer diesen Zusammenhang kann man die innere Dynamik
politischer Veraenderungen nicht erklaeren.

Politik jenseits der Schriftkultur kommt nicht aus heiterem Himmel.
Sie beinhaltet Erwartungen, die unter verschiedenen pragmatischen
Umstaenden entstanden sind, und sie muss sich Herausforderungen
stellen--die wichtigste Herausforderung ist die in der neuen Skala
der menschlichen Erfahrung erwartete Effizienz--fuer die die
traditionellen Mittel und Strukturen nicht angemessen sind.
Politische Diskontinuitaet zu akzeptieren oder gar zu verstehen, war
schon immer schwer.  Revolutionen werden erst gefeiert, wenn sie
stattgefunden haben und wenn die neuen Verhaeltnisse Stabilitaet
suggerieren.


Kann Schriftlichkeit zum Scheitern der Politik fuehren?

Viel ist darueber geschrieben worden, dass die Sprache der Politik und
die politische Realitaet auseinander klaffen.  Das Misstrauen der
Menschen gegenueber der Politik hat einen Hoehepunkt erreicht.  Rolle
und Bedeutung der politischen Fuehrer und Institutionen haben sich
offenbar veraendert.  Die Faehigsten sind nicht unbedingt an der
Politik beteiligt.  Ihre Selbstkonstituierung vollzieht sich in
praktischen Erfahrungen, die lohnender und anspruchsvoller sind als
politische Taetigkeit.  Politische Institutionen repraesentieren nicht
mehr die politischen Vertragspartner, sondern betreiben ihr eigenes
UEberleben.  Die Justiz fuehrt ein eigenes Leben, sie kuemmert sich--wie
die OEffentlichkeit glaubt--im Namen der Buergerrechte mehr um die
Kriminellen als um die Gerechtigkeit.  Steuern stuetzen extravagante
Regierungen und die gesellschaftliche Umverteilung von Reichtum;
darin spiegelt sich aber eher ein Schuldkomplex bezueglich vergangener
Ungerechtigkeiten als wahre gesellschaftliche Solidaritaet wider.
Statt menschliche Beziehungen zu foerdern und die Zukunft in Angriff
zu nehmen, flicken sie immer noch die Vergangenheit.  Jeder beklagt
sich.  Aber immer weniger sind bereit, etwas zu tun, weil
individuelle Teilhabe und Engagement in der gegebenen politischen
Struktur zu nichts fuehren.

Die meisten Menschen schauen auf eine fruehere politische Erfahrung
zurueck und interpretieren die Vergangenheit im Lichte der Buecher, die
sie gelesen haben.  Sie sehen nicht, dass der Komplexitaet der heutigen
menschlichen Erfahrung nicht mit den Loesungen von gestern beizukommen
ist.  Auch die Verfassung der Vereinigten Staaten und die Erklaerung
der Menschenrechte spiegeln das Denken und den Stil der Schriftkultur
wider.  AEhnliche Dokumente gibt es in Lateinamerika, Europa, Indien
und Japan.  Sie sind so nutzlos, wie Geschichte nur sein kann, wenn
neue Umstaende der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung sich von den
Erfahrungen unterscheiden, die sich in diesen Dokumenten ausdruecken.
Revisionismus hilft nicht weiter.  Der neue weite Kontext braucht
keine hehren Prinzipien, sondern dynamische politische Strukturen und
Verfahren.  Wenn die Welt sich als eine allseits verknuepfte neu
erfindet, hat sie sich von engen Vorschriften und traditionellen
Bedeutungen befreit.

Obwohl die Zahl der neu entstehenden Laender immer groesser wird (und es
ist offen, wieviel hinzukommen), wissen wir von keinem politischen
Dokument, das der Unabhaengigkeitserklaerung, der Erklaerung der
Menschen- und Buergerrechte oder dem Kommunistischen Manifest
vergleichbar ist.  Der Grund hierfuer liegt in der Tatsache, dass die
Schriftkultur heute eine unangemessene Grundlage fuer Politik ist.
Unsere Kultur ist keine Kultur der Ideen mehr, seien sie religioes
oder weltlich.  Sie wird von Prozessen, Methoden und Erfindungen
gekennzeichnet, die in vielen Zeichensystemen ausgedrueckt werden, die
eine andere Dynamik als die der Sprache der Schriftkultur besitzen.
Die Ideen der Schriftkultur wenden sich an Intellekt, Seele und Gemuet.

Sehr wohl duerfen wir in dieser Zeit des Umbruchs aber Massnahmen
erwarten, die die ungehinderte Interaktion auf dem Markt und in
anderen Bereichen menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung (Religion,
Bildung, Familie) garantieren.  Stetige Globalisierung heisst, dass
Stabilitaet nationaler Wirtschaftssysteme und nationaler Bildungs-,
Sport- oder Kunstsysteme genauso bedeutungslos ist wie nationale
Grenzen und die theatralischen Inszenierungen der Diplomatie und der
internationalen Beziehungen.

Die Dynamik des Umbruchs zeigt sich auch in dem Bestreben vieler
Laender, in die globale Wirtschaft integriert zu werden und sich
dennoch einen Hauch nationaler Identitaet zu bewahren oder zu schaffen.
Staatliche Souveraenitaet in Form von nationaler Autonomie des
Handels, im Finanzwesen oder der Industrie ist eine Illusion.
Selbstbestimmung, die immer zu Lasten irgendeiner anderen ethnischen
Gruppe geht, erinnert an primitive Stammestriebe.  Die Grundstruktur
der Schriftkultur spiegelt sich in nationalen Bewegungen und in ihren
dualistischen Wertesystemen wider.  Die einfache Logik von Gut und
Boese, die in einem Vagheitskontext schwerer zu definieren, aber
dennoch richtungsweisend ist, bestimmt Koalitionsbildungen, unsere
Richtlinien im Umgang mit Migrationsbewegungen und die Verteidigung
unserer nationalen Interessen, obwohl ein jeder Integration und
freien Markt fordert.

Gleichwohl ist auch die Sprache der heutigen Politik vom heutigen
pragmatischen Rahmen geformt.  Die Freiheit, die zu propagieren sie
vorgibt, ist die der kommerziellen Demokratie: gleiches Recht auf
Konsum ist die politische Errungenschaft der juengeren Geschichte.
Die Tatsache, dass die Staaten der Europaeischen Union ihre
Marktsouveraenitaet aufgegeben haben, bestaetigt unsere These.  Dass sie
immer noch eigene diplomatische Vertretungen und eine eigene
Verteidigungs- und Einwanderungspolitik betreiben, bezeugt nur den
Konflikt zwischen der Politik der Schriftkultur und einer Politik
jenseits davon.

Menschenrechte, die aus natuerlichen Zyklen abgeleitet wurden, sind
etwas anderes als politische Rechte und Verantwortlichkeiten, die
sich aus einem maschinellen Fortschrittsmodell herleiten lassen.
Aber beide Quellen unterscheiden sich vom politischen Status der
Menschen, die im neuen pragmatischen Rahmen globaler Netzwerke und
extremer Aufgabenverteilung eingebunden sind.  Man koennte sagen, dass
die grossen politischen Dokumente der Vergangenheit als Reaktion auf
einen unhaltbaren Zustand, nicht aber in Antizipation neuer
Moeglichkeiten und Erwartungen verfasst wurden.  Diese Dokumente
versuchen, in einer Welt relativ autonomer Einheiten--der
Nationalstaaten--die widerstreitenden Kraefte, die eher um Ressourcen
und Produktivkraefte als um Maerkte kaempften, zu vereinigen, zu
homogenisieren und zu integrieren.  Die darin ausgedrueckten Werte
sind die Werte der Schriftkultur, fuer die die aus der Schriftkultur
erwachsenen Ideologien eintraten.

Aber vielleicht dokumentieren diese Texte auch noch etwas anderes, z.
B. moralische Massstaebe, die wir im Laufe der vergangenen 200 Jahre
offenbar verloren haben; oder kulturelle Massstaebe fuer die
Gesellschaft und fuer ihre Politiker, Massstaebe, die heute kaum noch
gelten.  Wenn dem so waere, dann ist der Preis fuer hoehere politische
Effizienz der Verlust jeglicher Massstaebe und der gegenwaertig zu
verzeichnende beklagenswerte intellektuelle Zustand der Politik.  Die
fehlende Wechselbeziehung zwischen der politischen Praxis und ihrer
Sprache ruehrt vom pragmatischen Kontext her, der sich im Zustand der
Sprache spiegelt.  Waehrend das wirkliche Leben von vielen Sprachen
gestaltet wird, dominiert in der Politik immer noch das Ideal der
einen Schriftkultur, der einen daraus hervorgegangenen Sprache.  Ihre
Regeln werden auf Interaktionen und Evaluationen angewendet, die
nicht auf die Selbstkonstituierung durch Sprache reduziert werden
koennen.

Politisches Handeln folgt im grossen und ganzen Mustern, die fuer die
Schriftkultur charakteristisch sind, obwohl es sich selbst
nichtsprachlicher Zeichensysteme bedient: Bilder, Filme oder Videos,
neue Netzwerktechniken mit schnellem Informationsaustausch.  Die
frueheren Erwartungen, dass Politiker die Massstaebe der Schriftkultur
erfuellen, werden auf neue politische und praktische Erfahrungen
uebertragen.  Dabei liegen die praktischen Erfahrungen fast aller
Menschen heute in Gebieten, in denen die Vergangenheit kaum noch eine
Rolle spielt.  Die von der Industriegesellschaft entwickelten
politischen Prinzipien gestalten noch heute unsere Institutionen und
Gesetze, die weitgehend mit ihrem eigenen Erhalt beschaeftigt sind.

Weil sich die Buerger heute nicht um ihre eigene Freiheit sorgen
muessen, nehmen sie sie als selbstverstaendlich hin und entziehen sich
ihrer staatsbuergerlichen Verantwortung.  Sie erwarten von ihren
Politikern, dass diese an ihrer Stelle gebildet sind.  So kommt es
dazu, dass wir einerseits ein politisches Leben erwarten, das sich an
Homogenitaet und einer deterministischen Sicht der sozialen Welt
orientiert; andererseits aber zur Bewaeltigung der Probleme
politisches Spezialistentum und Mittel und Methoden fordern, die fuer
heterogene und nicht-deterministische politische Prozesse
charakteristisch sind.  Diesem Konflikt begegnen wir mit einer
Denkhaltung, die das Problem deshalb nicht loesen wird, weil sie das
Problem ist.

Die Koordination des politischen Handelns durch schriftkulturelle
Sprache und Methoden und die Dynamik einer neuen politischen Praxis
jenseits der Schriftkultur passen einfach nicht zusammen.  Also
scheint es, als wuerden Institutionen, Normen und Regelungen ein
Eigenleben annehmen und ihre eigenen Werte und Erwartungen
perpetuieren.  Die ihnen eigene Dynamik ist von der Dynamik des
politischen Lebens und vom neuen pragmatischen Kontext abgekoppelt.
Die unglaubliche Menge geschriebener Sprache (Reden, Artikel,
Formulare, Vertraege, Regelungen, Gesetze, Abhandlungen) kontrastiert
zu den rapiden Veraenderungen, die fast jeden politischen Text
ueberfluessig machen, bevor er in den Printmedien oder in den
fluechtigen Bits und Bytes der elektronischen Datenverarbeitung
erscheint.

Die Wirtschaft hat sich einer tiefgreifenden Umstrukturierung
unterzogen oder steht davor.  Personalabbau in grossem Umfang,
flachere Hierarchien und reibungslose Qualitaetskontrolle haben die
wirtschaftliche Leistung beeinflusst.  Aber sehr wenig davon hat die
sakrosankten staatlichen Institutionen beruehrt.  In den USA belaufen
sich die Ausgaben von 40 Ministerien, 135 Bundesbehoerden, die ueber
ein Zivilpersonal von 2,1 Millionen und ein Militaerpersonal von 1,9
Millionen Menschen verfuegen, auf 1,5 Billionen Dollar pro Jahr.
Allein die Kosten fuer das Umsetzen von Regeln und Anordnungen
betragen ueber 250 Milliarden Dollar jaehrlich.  Um die Steuergesetze
erfuellen zu koennen, muessen Unternehmen und Einzelpersonen fast
denselben Geldbetrag aufwenden.  Wenn die Wirtschaft so ineffizient
wie die Politik waere, stuenden wir vor einer Krise globalen Ausmasses,
deren Konsequenzen niemand absehen kann.  In den europaeischen Staaten,
besonders in Deutschland und Frankreich, sind die entsprechenden
Ausgaben--relativ--noch hoeher.

In den Augen mancher Buerger muesste heute daher eine
Unabhaengigkeitserklaerung mit der folgenden Zeile beginnen: "Uns
platzt der Kragen--wir nehmen es nicht laenger hin."  Aber auch das
wuerde nicht heissen, dass sie waehlen gehen.  Wenn fuenfmal mehr Menschen
die vulgaere amerikanische Fernsehserie Married with Children
anschauen als sich an den amerikanischen Wahlen beteiligen, wird klar,
wie sehr Moral und intellektuelle Qualitaet von Politikern und
Buergern einander entsprechen.  So zynisch diese Bemerkung klingt, sie
stellt nur fest, dass das politische Handeln jenseits der
Schriftkultur und die politischen Urteilskriterien nicht mehr den
politischen Erfahrungen der Schriftkultur folgen.

Ein Staat, der allein auf einer durch Schriftkultur und Sprache
genaehrten Politik beruht, ist auch in der Sprache ge- und befangen.
Die in der Sprache ausgedrueckten Erfahrungen sind ihrem Wesen nach
nicht zwangslaeufig demokratisch.  Das gilt z. B. fuer unsere
Bezeichnungen von Geschlecht, Rasse, gesellschaftlichem Status, Raum,
Zeit, Religion, Kunst und Sport.  Wenn sie erst einmal in die Sprache
eingegangen sind, leben sie einfach fort und beeinflussen jedes
politische Handeln.  Die Sprache ist nicht neutral, und noch weniger
ist es die schriftkulturelle Praxis.  Minderheitengruppen haben
voellig zu Recht darauf hingewiesen.  Zwar verhindert Schriftkultur
nicht jeglichen Wandel; sie laesst Wandel im schriftkulturellen Bereich
zu, solange sie auf den praktischen schriftkulturellen Erfahrungen
beruhen.  Aber wenn die Schriftkultur selbst in Frage gestellt wird,
wie es heute zunehmend geschieht, widersetzt sie sich diesem Wandel.

Wenn die Formulierung Verfall der moralischen Werte bedeutet, dass die
Politik die Erwartungen der Waehler nicht erfuellt, dann waeren die
schlimmsten Befuerchtungen gerechtfertigt; denn Politiker sind nicht
besser und nicht schlechter als ihre Waehler.  Aber heute fuehrt nicht
mehr die individuelle Leistung zu Erfolg oder Misslingen.
Integrationsformen schaffen neue Formen von Kooperation und
Wettbewerb.  Solche Prozesse werden von effizienteren Mitteln, d. h.
von Aufgabenteilung, Parallelitaet und gegenseitiger UEberpruefung, von
Kooperation ueber Netzwerke, automatischen Planungs- und
Managementverfahren usw. betrieben.  Sie stehen im Einklang mit den
neuen Motivationen.  Wenn die romantische Vorstellung, dass die Besten
unsere Fuehrer werden, wirklich zutraefe, haetten wir allen Grund, uns
ueber unsere Dummheit zu wundern.  Aber tatsaechlich ist es irrelevant,
wer die politische Fuehrung hat.  Der neue Effizienzgrad und das neue
erworbene Recht auf Wohlstand verweisen auf eine politische Praxis,
die von pragmatischen Kraeften gesteuert ist.  Solche Kraefte sind vor
Ort am Werke und ergeben nur in einem Kontext direkter Effizienz Sinn.
Wir sollten sie nicht nur als selbstverstaendlich ansehen, sondern
auch zu verstehen versuchen, wie sie arbeiten und wie man sie lenken
kann.


Die Krabben haben pfeifen gelernt

Einige der heutigen politischen Systeme werden als Demokratien
angesehen, andere behaupten, es zu sein.  Einige gelten als
Diktaturen irgendeiner Art, und niemand wuerde dies als Qualifikation
akzeptieren.  Aber gleich, welche Bezeichnung man waehlt, in all
diesen Systemen herrscht die Schriftkultur.  Manche halten
Schriftkultur und Bildung als fuer die Demokratie lebenswichtig; aber:
die groesste Diktatur (der Ostblock) konnte einen hohen allgemeinen
Bildungsstand vorweisen.  Sie scheiterte, weil die zugrundeliegenden
Strukturmerkmale mit anderen Erfordernissen, vor allem pragmatischer
Art, kollidierten.

Ein Weltreich, das vierte in der geschichtlichen Abfolge nach dem
Osmanischen Reich, OEsterreich-Ungarn und dem Britischen Empire,
zerbrach.  Was das Scheitern des Sowjetreichs so wichtig macht, ist
die ihm zugrundeliegende Struktur.  Die frueheren Mitglieder des RGW,
die osteuropaeischen Staaten, die einst mit der Sowjetunion den
Ostblock bildeten, geben eine gute Fallstudie fuer die an der Dynamik
jenseits der Schriftkultur beteiligten Kraefte ab.  Waehrend ich dieses
Buch schrieb, kam mir ein Ereignis zugute, das wohl kaum je
wiederholt wird: Eine feste Struktur menschlichen Handelns, die im
Grunde einem leicht veraenderten Paradigma der Industriellen
Revolution folgte, sich selbst als Arbeiterparadies pries und unter
der Illusion eines messianischen Kollektivismus lebte, beharrte auf
Schriftkultur als seiner kulturellen Grundlage.

Selbst die schaerfsten Kritiker des Systems mussten einraeumen, dass das
allgemeine Bildungsprogramm zu den historischen Leistungen des
Kommunismus zu zaehlen ist.  Weite Teile der Bevoelkerung, die vor der
Machtergreifung der Kommunisten nicht lesen und schreiben konnte,
wurden alphabetisiert.  So mangelhaft das Schulsystem vielleicht war,
es bot kostenlose und obligatorische Bildung, die wesentlich besser
war als das kostenlose Gesundheitssystem.  Die Ausbildungsoffensive
sollte neue Generationen auf produktive Aufgaben vorbereiten und jede
einzelne Person einem Indoktrinationsprogramm unterziehen, das ueber
das maechtige Medium der Schriftkultur ablief.  Noch Nikita
Chruschtschow erklaerte: "Wer glaubt, dass wir die Lehren von Marx,
Engels und Lenin aufgeben, taeuscht sich gewaltig.  Wer darauf wartet,
muss warten, bis die Krabben pfeifen koennen."  Als in Russland die
Lenin-Statuen umgestuerzt wurden und Marx’ Name gleichbedeutend mit
dem Scheitern des Kommunismus wurde, muessen die Menschen seltsame
Geraeusche von Krustentieren vernommen haben.

Das abrupte und unerwartete Scheitern des kommunistischen Systems ist
der unerwartete Beweis fuer die Hauptthese dieses Buchs.  Der
Zusammenbruch des Sowjetsystems kann als das Scheitern einer Struktur
gesehen werden, die Schriftkultur als ihr wichtigstes Bildungs- und
Handlungsprinzip einsetzte und sich darauf verliess, um ihre
ideologischen Ziele innerhalb und ausserhalb des Blocks zu verbreiten.
Nicht die Schriftkultur an sich scheiterte, aber die Strukturen,
welche ihr zu eigen sind: begrenzte Effizienz, sequentielle
praktische Erfahrungen der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung in einer
hierarchisierten und zentralistischen Wirtschaft; deterministische
(somit implizit dualistische) Arbeitsverhaeltnisse, ein auf dem
industriellen Modell der Arbeitsteilung beruhendes Effizienzniveau,
eine der zentralen Planung unterworfene Vermittlung;
Undurchschaubarkeit, die sich in besessener Geheimhaltung aeusserte,
und schliesslich die fehlende OEffnung fuer die neue Skala der
Menschheit--kurz, ein pragmatischer Rahmen, dessen Merkmale sich in
der Schriftkultur zeigen.  Tatsaechlich unternahm das kommunistische
System einiges, um Integration und Globalitaet zu bekaempfen.  Es hielt
an bestimmten nationalen und politischen Grenzen fest in der falschen
Annahme, dass Isolation einen gesteuerten und geordneten Waren- und
Gedankenaustausch zulassen wuerde; es hielt an der Verbreitung einer
Ideologie der Diktatur des Proletariats fest und uebte Koexistenz mit
dem Rest der Welt in der Annahme, dass diese Schritt fuer Schritt zu
kommunistischen Werten konvertieren wuerde.

Alle schriftkulturellen Taetigkeiten--und das war fast alles--wurden
subventioniert.  In keinem anderen Teil der Welt unter keinem anderem
Regime wurden so viele Menschen so radikal der Schriftkultur
unterworfen.  Dass das System scheiterte, sollte niemanden dazu
veranlassen, die Leistungen der Menschen zu ignorieren, die unter
einem Banner, das ihnen nichts bedeutete, zwangsvereint waren: Grosse
kuenstlerische Leistungen, Dichtung und Musik, umfangreiche Pflege der
Volkskunst, spektakulaere Leistungen in Mathematik, Physik und Chemie
brachen unter Terror und Zensur hervor.  Als Kuenstler, Autor oder
Wissenschaftler zu ueberleben hiess, Kreativitaet zu erzwingen, wo es
fast keinen Raum mehr fuer sie gab.  In keinem anderen Regime dieser
Erde lasen die Menschen mehr, hoerten sie mehr Musik, besuchten sie
Museen mit groesserer Leidenschaft und sorgten sie fuereinander im
Familien- und Freundeskreis.  Und sie taten es keineswegs nur deshalb,
weil sie sonst nichts zu tun hatten.

Es versteht sich von selbst, dass vor allem der Missbrauch der Sprache
(im politischen Diskurs und im gesellschaftlichen Leben) zu der fast
einmuetigen stillschweigenden Ablehnung des Systems fuehrte, und mehr
noch in der stillschweigenden, feigen Komplizenschaft mit ihm.  Als
die schriftkulturelle Maschinerie des Ausspionierens der Bevoelkerung
zerbrach, sahen sich die Menschen im unbarmherzigen Spiegel ihres
opportunistischen Selbstbetrugs.  Zu den historischen Dokumenten
gehoeren nicht nur Solschenizyns Romane, Jewtuschenkos Lyrik und
Schostakowitschs Musik, sondern auch das Schreckliche, was Freunde
ueber Freunde, Verwandte ueber Verwandte kolportiert haben.  Die
Deutschen waren, von einigen Ausnahmen abgesehen, nicht besser als
ihre faschistischen Fuehrer; die Menschen im Sowjetblock waren, von
einigen Ausnahmen abgesehen, nicht besser als die Fuehrer, die sie so
lange Zeit gewaehren liessen.

Aber kein Ostblockexperte und keine Regierung hatten die Dynamik des
Umbruchs bemerkt.  Das System war wirtschaftlich bankrott, aber
militaerisch immer noch lebensfaehig (wenn auch ueberschaetzt).  Die
Struktur, in der die Menschen ihr Potential verwirklichen
wollten--eines der Ideale des Kommunismus--bot wenig Anreize.  Die
Dynamik des Systems war dadurch stark beeintraechtigt, dass ein
ueberkommener pragmatischer Rahmen und ein Wertesystem kuenstlich
aufrechterhalten wurden, die fuer Wandel nicht geeignet waren,
insbesondere fuer den Wandel zur postindustriellen Gesellschaft, wie
er sich in der westlichen Welt vollzog.

Die Hauptereignisse, die zum Zusammenbruch fuehrten, liefen auf den
Fernsehbildschirmen vor den Augen der Nationen ab, im Bann der
Dynamik von Liveuebertragungen, fuer die die Schriftkultur und der
vorherige schriftkulturelle Gebrauch des Mediums nie gut ausgeruestet
waren.  Die Jagd auf Ceausescu in Rumaenien, der Fall der Berliner
Mauer, die Ereignisse in Prag, Sofia und Tirana knuepften an den Geist
des Fernsehdramas aus den polnischen Werften an.  Waehrend des
versuchten Putsches in der Sowjetunion nahm die Entwicklung
kurzfristig eine andere Wendung, verleugnete den schriftlichen Medien
quasi jegliche Rolle ausser der des spaeten Chronisten.  Der erste
Unterricht in Sachen Demokratie vollzog sich ueber Videokassetten.
Verschiedene Netzwerke, von WTN (WorldWide Television News) bis zu
CNN, aber hauptsaechlich die alte Technik des Faxgeraets besorgten den
Rest.  So primitiv die digitalen Netzwerke auch waren und in jenem
Teil der Welt noch immer sind, sie spielten eine wichtige Rolle.
Keine politischen Manifeste oder raffinierten ideologischen Dokumente
wurden verbreitet, sondern Bilder, Diagramme und Liveberichte.  In
der Zwischenzeit uebernahm das Entertainment fast die gesamte
verfuegbare Bandkapazitaet.  Der gesamte westliche Konsum der letzten
15 Jahre (Mode, Fast-food-Ketten, Softdrinks und Konsumelektronik)
durchdrang das Leben derer, deren Revolte unter dem Banner des Rechts
auf Konsum stattgefunden hatte.  Hier wie im Rest der Welt trennten
sich das Geistige und das Politische fuer immer.  Das Geistige bezieht
Alimente; das Politische wird der Treuhandverwalter.

Das System scheiterte am mangelnden Verstaendnis fuer die Faktoren, die
zu neuen produktiven Erfahrungen fuehren: eine optimale Interaktion
der Menschen, progressive Mediation und spezialisiertere Formen der
Selbstkonstituierung, Einrichtung von Netzwerken und deren
Koordination, individuelle Freiheit und frei gewaehlte Zwaenge.
AEhnlich erging es den Kirchen im Ostblock.  Weil sie das Regime
ablehnten, gingen die Menschen in die Kirche, die ihrerseits eine
Hochburg schriftkultureller Praxis ist (unabhaengig vom Buch oder von
den Buechern, die ihr programmatisch zugrunde liegen).  Sobald es der
Religion moeglich war, ihre schriftkulturellen Merkmale durch die
Ausuebung von Zwaengen zu behaupten, ging die Zahl der Kirchgaenger wie
ueberall auf der Welt zurueck.

Viele Fragen sind noch offen.  Wie muss man z. B. im Kontext der
globalen Wirtschaft das Entstehen neuer Nationalstaaten und maechtiger
nationalistischer Bewegungen beurteilen, wenn der postnationale Staat
und die transnationale Welt schon Wirklichkeit geworden sind?  Die
Frage ist ihrem Wesen nach politisch.  Ihr Fokus liegt auf der
Identitaet.  Die Identitaet spiegelt alle Beziehungen wider, ueber die
die Menschen sich als Teil einer groesseren Einheit
konstituieren--Stamm, Stadt, Region, Nation: Als Traeger gemeinsamer
biologischer und kultureller Merkmale, gemeinsamer Werte, einer
gemeinsamen Religion, eines gemeinsamen Raum-, Zeit- und
Zukunftsgefuehls.


Von Stammeshaeuptlingen, Koenigen und Praesidenten

Veraenderungen im Zustand praktischer menschlicher Erfahrungen bringen
Veraenderungen in der Selbstidentifikation des Individuums und von
Gruppen mit sich.  Neue politische Erfahrungen, die immer noch
Erwartungen unterworfen sind, die von der Vergangenheit uebernommen
wurden, setzen eigentlich nicht die Vergangenheit fort.  Entsprechend
veraendert sich das Wesen politischer Erfahrungen.  Vorstellungen ueber
Fuehrung, Organisation, Planung und Legalitaet werden neu definiert.
Aus den Stammeshaeuptlingen wurden die Koenige des Mittelalters und
schliesslich die neuzeitlichen Praesidenten.  Es gibt jedoch keinen
Grund zur Annahme, dass bei verteilten Aufgaben und paralleler
Handlungsstruktur Zentralismus und Hierarchie die entscheidenden
politischen Prinzipien bleiben muessen.  Exekutive, Legislative und
Judikative setzen die Ideale der liberalen politischen Demokratie um,
wie sie fuer den pragmatischen Rahmen der Industriegesellschaft
wesentlich werden.  Doch sobald sich neue Umstaende abzeichnen,
wandeln sich mit der Grundstruktur auch die Machtstrukturen.

In einem Rahmen nicht-hierarchischer Strukturen besteht z. B. kein
wirklicher Bedarf mehr am Praesidentenamt.  Theoretische Argumente
muessen durch Fakten bekraeftigt werden.  Die neuen Lebensumstaende
haben schon in vielen Laendern das Amt des Praesidenten auf reine
Repraesentationsfunktionen beschraenkt.  Andere Staaten schraenken die
Macht des Praesidenten durch Gesetze so sehr ein, dass sie diesen Namen
nicht mehr verdient.  Wirtschaftszyklen machen sogar die visionaersten
Staatsoberhaeupter (so es sie denn gibt) zu blossen Zuschauern von
Ereignissen, die sie nicht beeinflussen koennen.

Wer wuerde das Land repraesentieren, wenn die Funktion des
Staatsoberhauptes abgeschafft waere?  Wie kann ein Land ein
geschlossenes, in sich konsistentes politisches System
aufrechterhalten?  Wer wuerde die Gesetze erlassen, wer umsetzen?
Solche Fragen ergeben sich ausnahmslos aus den Erwartungen der
Schriftkultur.  Dagegen foerdert die radikale Dezentralisierung, die
sich jenseits der Schriftkultur durchsetzt, andere politische
Strukturen.  Der politisch interessierte Buerger ist ein Trugbild.
Die Wirklichkeit kennt Buerger, die ihre eigenen Ziele verfolgen,
welche allerdings politische Elemente beinhalten.  Die Schriftkultur
fuehrte zu repraesentativen Formen der Politik, die schliesslich die
Buerger vom Prozess der politischen Entscheidungsbildung ausschloss.
Die wirklichen politischen Ideale sind nunmehr eine Sache effizienter
menschlicher Interaktion.  Fuer den Informationsaustausch ueber
Netzwerke, in denen Menschen gleicher Interessen kooperieren, ist die
Leistung eines Praesidenten voellig irrelevant.  Die fuer diese Vorgaenge
relevanten UEbereinkuenfte, die sich auf gegenseitige Beduerfnisse und
zukuenftige Entwicklungen richten, werden ausserhalb der politischen
Institutionen getroffen, die nur noch wenig damit zu tun haben.

Die meisten politischen Aufgaben von Praesidenten,
Nationalversammlungen oder anderen politischen Institutionen ergeben
sich noch immer aus Formen, die fuer eine vergangene politische Praxis
charakteristisch sind.  Sie beruhen auf Buendnissen und
Verpflichtungen, die im Widerspruch zum pragmatischen Rahmen der
heutigen Welt stehen.  Die Tatsache, dass Staatsoberhaeupter auch
Oberbefehlshaber der Armeen sind, stammt aus einer Zeit, in der der
staerkste Mann der Fuehrer wurde.  Aber heute sind auch Frauen legitime
Kandidatinnen fuer ein Praesidentenamt.  Trotzdem haben
geschlechtsspezifische Vorurteile verhindert, dass Frauen die
militaerische Kompetenz erlangen, die man von einem Oberbefehlshaber
erwartet.  Ein weiteres Beispiel: Warum muss ein Praesident beim
Begraebnis eines verstorbenen Staatsoberhauptes zugegen sein?  Die
Bande des Bluts verbanden einst Koenige und Adel staerker miteinander
als politische Argumente; aber kein Verkehrsmittel konnte sie zu den
Verstorbenen bringen, bevor deren Verfall einsetzte.  Ein letztes
Lebewohl, das man heute anlaesslich des Begraebnisses eines japanischen
Kaisers, eines muslimischen Fuehrers oder eines atheistischen
Praesidenten wuenscht, gehoert zum politischen Theater, nicht zum
politischen Wesen.  Die teure und truegerische Inszenierung von
Staatsbegraebnissen, Geloebnissen, Einweihungen, Paraden und
Staatsbesuchen ist oft nichts anderes als eine UEbung in
Scheinheiligkeit.  Die Schauspiele gefallen nur, weil sie zynisch das
Beduerfnis des Volkes nach Spielen stillen.  Pragmatisch relevante
Verpflichtungen sind nicht mehr das Vorrecht von Staatsbuerokratien,
sie wurden in andere Zusammenhaenge eingebunden.  Wenn aber ein
Staatswesen historisch nicht sehr viel mehr ist als ein Ausdruck
archaischer Stammesinstinkte, dann hat sich die schriftkulturelle
Institution des Staates eruebrigt.

Politische Heldenverehrung, Nationalismus im wirtschaftlichen Bereich
und ethnische Eitelkeit beeintraechtigen die Politik auf vielen Ebenen.
Der Nationalismus als eine Form kollektiven Stolzes und
psychologischer Ersatzbefriedigung fuer unterdrueckte Triebe feiert
Goldmedaillen bei Olympischen Spielen, die Zahl der Nobelpreistraeger
und die Errungenschaften in den Kuensten und der Wissenschaft mit
einer Leidenschaft, die einen besseren Anlass verdient haette.  Stolz
und Vorurteilsgrenzen werden beibehalten, auch wo Staatsgrenzen de
facto nicht mehr existieren.  Wissenschaftliche Hochleistungen sind
nie in der voelligen Isolation von der gelehrten Welt entstanden.  Das
Internet unterstuetzt--heute vielleicht noch nicht im gewuenschten
Ausmass--die Integration kreativer Anstrengungen und Ideen ueber
Grenzen hinweg. Die Kunst wird in ihm ausserhalb des etablierten
Kunstgeschaefts gefoerdert.


Rhetorik und Politik

Politische Programme werden wie Hamburger, Autos, Alkohol,
Sportereignisse, Kunstwerke und Finanzdienstleistungen vermarktet.
Erfolg in der Politik wird eher nach Marktkriterien bewertet als nach
ihren immer fluechtigeren politischen Auswirkungen.  "Menschen waehlen
nach ihrem Portmonnaie."  Aber waehlen sie denn?  Eine Wahlnacht nach
der anderen zeigt, dass sie es nicht tun.  Frueher waren Analphabeten
gewoehnlich von der Wahl ausgeschlossen, ebenso Frauen, Schwarze in
Amerika und Suedafrika und Auslaender in vielen europaeischen Staaten.

In einer idealen Welt wuerde sich der Hoechstqualifizierte um ein
politisches Amt bewerben, wuerden alle waehlen und wuerde das Ergebnis
alle gluecklich machen.  Wie wuerde eine solche ideale Welt
funktionieren?  Worte wuerden Tatsachen entsprechen.  Die Belohnung
fuer politische Taetigkeit waere die politische Erfahrung selbst, die
Genugtuung, anderen und somit sich selbst als Mitglied einer groesseren
sozialen Familie zu nuetzen.  Das ist eine utopische Welt aus
perfekten Buergern, deren Vernunft, die sich in der Sprache der
Schriftkultur ausdrueckt, Hueter der Politik ist.  Wir sehen hier, wie
die Autoritaet des denkenden menschlichen Wesens etabliert und fast
automatisch mit Freiheit gleichgesetzt wird.  In vielen pragmatischen
Kontexten musste sich Individualitaet der rationalen Notwendigkeit
anpassen, jedoch nie so ausgepraegt wie in dem Kontext, der sich die
Schriftkultur zu einer seiner Triebkraefte waehlte.

Aus der Perspektive der Schriftkultur gesehen erwartet man, dass die
Erfahrungen der Selbstkonstituierung als gebildeter Schriftkundiger
die Menschen dazu fuehrt, ihre Natur dem Prinzip der Schriftkultur zu
unterwerfen und darin Erfuellung zu finden.  Der Glaube, dass die
Bildung jemanden veranlasst, ein Wort zu halten oder andere Menschen
zu respektieren, politische Erwartungen zu verstehen und seine
eigenen Gedanken zu formulieren, ist wohl eine Illusion.  Wenn
darueber hinaus Politik dazu fuehren wuerde, dass jeder die Werte der
Schriftkultur akzeptiert und sie als seine zweite Natur verinnerlicht,
muessten sich Konflikte loesen, alle Menschen am Wohlstand teilhaben
und sich zudem angemessen demokratisch und verantwortlich verhalten.
Der Gebildete muesste die Verpflichtung fuehlen, anderen diese Bildung
einzuimpfen, wodurch sich die Muster der menschlichen Erfahrungen so
veraenderten, dass sie die schriftkulturelle Vernunft schlechthin
verkoerpern wuerden.  Isaiah Berlin hat neben anderen betont, dass der
Glaube an eine allumfassende Antwort auf alle sozialen Fragen nicht
zu halten ist.  Eher ist der Konflikt ein hervorstechendes Merkmal
der menschlichen Lage.  Dieser Konflikt entwickelt sich zwischen dem
Hang zu Vielfalt und Mannigfaltigkeit und der fast irrationalen
Erwartung, dass es eine einzige richtige Antwort auf unsere Probleme
gibt, die verfolgt zu werden sich lohnt und die erreicht werden kann,
wenn das zoon politikon den Primat der Vernunft ueber die Leidenschaft
anerkennt und statt eines chaotischen Individualismus freiwillig die
Anpassung an weithin geteilte Werte uebt.

Unter den pragmatischen Umstaenden jenseits der Schriftkultur ist die
Erwartung, dass eine Wahl einstimmig oder mehrheitlich ausgeht, voellig
unwesentlich.  Wahlergebnisse sind ein ebenso guter Indikator fuer den
Zustand einer Gesellschaft wie Seismographen es fuer die Gefahr eines
Erdbebens sind.  Am Wahltag sind die Ergebnisse bekannt, nachdem die
ersten repraesentativen Stichproben genommen wurden.  Eigentlich sind
die Ergebnisse schon vor der Wahl bekannt.  Die verfuegbaren
technischen Mittel wuerden es ermoeglichen, dass die, die waehlen
wollen--und die wissen, warum sie waehlen--dies ohne groessere Umstaende
am Telefon tun koennten.  Auch die allgemein verbreitete Verkabelung
mit einem fuer das Wahlergebnis ausgeruesteten Zentralrechner koennte
diesen Zweck erfuellen.  Aber das wuerde nur einen Teil der Frage
beantworten.  Der zweite Teil bezieht sich darauf, was sie waehlen
sollen.  Die politische Praxis bietet keine aufregenden
Wahlmoeglichkeiten mehr.  Das auf Schriftkultur beruhende politische
Handeln ist undurchsichtig, fast unergruendlich.  Also sieht sich der
Buerger nicht zum Engagement veranlasst und nicht die Notwendigkeit,
sein Engagement durch den Urnengang auszudruecken.  Als ich den Text
dieses Buches fuer die Veroeffentlichung revidierte, gab es noch einen
dritten Aspekt: die Annahme naemlich, dass Waehlen eine Partizipation an
der demokratischen Macht ist.  Aber niemand, der sich der Dynamik der
heutigen Lebensumstaende bewusst ist, wird den Begriff der Mehrheit mit
Demokratie gleichsetzen.

Unter den heutigen Arbeitsumstaenden kann kein Praesident, egal wie
maechtig er ist oder zu sein glaubt, und keine zentrale Regierung auf
die Ereignisse Einfluss nehmen, die fuer den Buerger wirklich wesentlich
sind.  Jenseits der Schriftkultur werden Alternativen zu Zentralismus,
Hierarchie, Sequentialitaet und Determinismus in der Politik erwartet.
Vor allem benoetigen wir Alternativen zu dualistischen Strukturen,
ob im Zweiparteiensystem, der Gewaltenteilung zwischen Legislative
und Exekutive oder dem Gegensatz zwischen Gesetzestreue und
Illegalitaet.  Dies fuehrt zu einer weit gestreuten Verteilung
politischer Ausgaben in Verbindung mit einer Politik, die Vorteile
aus den neuen strukturalen Bedingungen der Arbeits- und Lebenswelt
zieht.  Selbstbestimmung wird zu den zentralen politischen Werten
zaehlen.  Schnellere Lebensrhythmen, Globalitaet und die neuen
Skalen--in Politik und in der Lebenswelt allgemein--sprechen gegen
die schriftkulturelle Erwartung, dass Politik ein stabilisierender
Faktor der menschlichen Praxis sei.  Wenn die Politik ihrer Aufgabe
gerecht werden will, sollte sie die Umstaende fuer bessere
Verhandlungen und Interaktionen zwischen den Menschen schaffen.  Nur
so kann man den Buergern, die ihren Sinn fuer politische Verantwortung
und sogar ihren Glauben an Recht und Ordnung verloren haben, neue
politische Zuversicht geben.

In dieser global vernetzten Welt, in der die Skala von groesster
Wichtigkeit ist, muss die Politik zwischen den vielen Ebenen
vermitteln, auf denen Menschen an dieser Globalitaet teilhaben.  In
diesem Zusammenhang ist die Regelung von Guetern und Rechten ein
wichtiger politischer Bereich.  Hier muss die Politik meinungs- und
wertebildend wirken.  Zum Beispiel liegt die wirkliche Macht der
Informationsverarbeitung in der Interaktion derer, die Zugriff darauf
haben.  Man sollte nicht gezwungen sein, Regeln, die aus dem feudalen
Besitz von Sprache oder aus dem industriellen Besitz von Maschinen
stammen, auf den freien Zugang zu Informationen oder zu Netzwerken
anzuwenden, die die gemeinschaftliche kreative Arbeit erleichtern.
Die politische Herausforderung liegt darin, das transparenteste
Umfeld zu liefern, ohne die Einheit der Interaktion zu
beeintraechtigen.  Angesichts des vielfaeltigen Selbstregelungsbedarfs
in diesem neuen Bereich muss sich auch die Legislative neu orientieren
und von ihren alten Denkstrukturen befreien.

Die Ereignisse werden nur dann einen positiven Verlauf nehmen, wenn
sie die politische Erfahrung individueller Machtzuweisung erlaubt.
Natuerlich bergen eine groessere Auswahl und breitere Moeglichkeiten
spezifische Risiken in sich.  Hacking ist keineswegs neu.  Der
deutsche Kriegskode wurde geknackt, und viele Laender sind sehr darauf
bedacht, Hackern von Rang Ehre zu erweisen: Wissenschaftlern, die das
Geheimnis genetischer Kodes knacken, oder Spionen, die hinter
Geheimnisse des Feindes kommen.  Aus einer schriftkulturellen
politischen Perspektive kann man Hacking--eine sehr eigene Form
individueller Selbstkonstituierung--als kriminell bezeichnen.  Im
neuen pragmatischen Rahmen jenseits der Schriftkultur ist Hacking in
einem Bereich angesiedelt, dessen Eckpunkte aus Kreativitaet, Protest,
Erfindungsgeist, Nichtkonformitaet und krimineller Energie bestehen.
Die geeignete Antwort auf Hacker waere kein Strafenkatalog
mittelalterlicher oder industrieller Praegung, sondern Transparenz,
die auf lange Sicht moegliche kriminelle Motive unterminiert.  Eine
Gesellschaft, die Kreativitaet sanktioniert, auch wenn diese auf
falsche Gebiete gelenkt ist, bestraft sich letztlich selbst.  Wer an
seinem Terminal fuer ein Unternehmen arbeitet, das in der ganzen Welt
produziert und soziale und wirtschaftliche Programme foerdert, die
Buergern vieler Kulturen, unterschiedlichen Glaubens,
unterschiedlicher Rassen, politischer UEberzeugungen, sexueller
Neigungen, unterschiedlicher Geschichte und unterschiedlicher
Erwartungen zugute kommen, nimmt an der Weltpolitik mehr und
entscheidender teil, als all die Behoerden und Buerokraten, die fuer
Aufgaben bezahlt werden, die sie nicht effektiv erfuellen koennen.
Wiederum ist es der pragmatische Rahmen, der uns zu Buergern unseres
kleinen Dorfes oder unserer kleinen Stadt macht, der uns alle, auch
die Internetbuerger, in die globale Welt integriert.


Die Justiz beurteilen

Diese kleine Abschweifung in der Diskussion ueber die Politik kann
damit gerechtfertigt werden, dass Gerechtigkeit eine Frage sowohl von
Politik als auch von Recht ist.  Die Anwendung der Gesetze ist die
Ausuebung von Politik in kleinem Stil.  Politisches Handeln, das an
eine neue Auffassung von Recht und Justiz gebunden war, welche sich
an der industriellen Arbeitswelt orientierte, setzte nicht nur fest,
dass alle (oder fast alle) vor dem Gesetz gleich sind, sondern auch,
dass die Justiz ihren eigenen unabhaengigen Weg geht.  Auch das
Rechtssystem unterlag dem historischen Wandel.  Frueher lag das Recht
in der Verfuegungsgewalt der Herrschenden.  Noch heute ist ein
Gouverneur oder Praesident in einigen Faellen die hoechste
Appellationsinstanz.  Wie die Politik beruht das Recht auf der
Rhetorik, auf der Sprache als Vermittlungsmechanismus.

Was in unserem Zusammenhang interessiert, ist der Wandel der im
Rahmen der Schriftkultur ausgearbeiteten Gesetzeskodizes und der
Rechtspraxis der Schriftkultur.  Die Institution der Justiz und die
Rechtsberufe verkoerpern Gerechtigkeitserwartungen im Rahmen einer
bestimmten Lebenspraxis.  Neue Laender wurden entdeckt, neues Eigentum
wurde geschaffen, und Maschinen und Menschen ermoeglichten eine hoehere
Produktivitaet.  Die Menschen kaempften um Rechte, der Zugang zur
Bildung wurde geoeffnet, und die Welt wurde ein Ort neuer
Transaktionen, fuer die das Bodenrecht, das in Anlehnung an das
Naturrecht entstand, nicht mehr ausreichte.  In diesem Zusammenhang
erhob sich die Frage nach dem Wesen der menschlichen Rechte und
Verpflichtungen.  Im selben Zusammenhang begann aber auch die Sprache
der Rechtspraxis sich auf das heutige Juristenchinesisch hin zu
entwickeln, das kein normaler Mensch versteht, weil keiner es
verstehen soll.  Das lag in der Natur der Sprache, war aber auch
beabsichtigt.  Um mit der Ambiguitaet der Sprache fertig zu werden,
suchten die Juristen moeglichst praezise Begriffe und unzweideutige
Formulierungen.

Die problematische Lage der Justiz zeigt sich daran, dass sie im
Bereich der politischen Praxis entwickelt wurde, nun jedoch politisch
unabhaengig sein muss.  Die Goettin mit den verbundenen Augen, die die
Waage der Gerechtigkeit haelt, soll objektiv und gerecht sein.  Die
Trennung von Judikative und Exekutive ist wohl die hoechste
Errungenschaft des politischen Systems der Schriftkultur.  Aber es
ist zugleich das Gebiet, in dem sich mit Blick auf die veraenderte
Lebenspraxis jenseits der Schriftkultur ein Wandel von entscheidender
Bedeutung vollzieht.  Vor allem gilt es, auch fuer diejenigen ein
gerechtes System zu schaffen, die sich weniger in dem durch die
Subjektivitaet der Machthaber abgesteckten Bereich und mehr im Bereich
der Informationsverarbeitung zu Hause fuehlen.  Justitia mit den
verbundenen Augen benutzt schon jetzt Roentgenstrahlen, um Klagen und
Gegenklagen abzuwaegen.  Modellierungen, Simulationen, Aussagen von
Genexperten und vieles mehr gehoeren bereits zum juristischen Alltag.
Der Kontext dieser Veraenderungen wirft ein Licht auf ihre politische
Bedeutung.  Wenn die Praxis von Politik und Justiz total getrennt
waere, wuerde die Effizienz beider darunter leiden.

Die Politik foerderte veraenderte Einstellungen zu Demokratie,
Buergerrechten, politischer Macht und sozialer Sicherung.  Sie
entmystifizierte die Herkunft, Funktion und Rolle des Eigentums und
foerderte eine relativere Sicht dieser Dinge sowie die Etablierung
allgemeingueltiger Werte.  Daher sollte die Justiz, die die Rechte der
einzelnen schuetzen soll, sich in Fragen der Gerechtigkeit nicht mit
dem kleinsten gemeinsamen Nenner zufriedengeben.  Wenn man dieses
Ideal an der juristischen Praxis misst, ist dies fast schon ein
masochistisches Unterfangen.  Die stetig und rasch zunehmenden
Interaktionen ueber Marktmechanismen wurden von Konfliktmomenten und
Verhandlungserwartungen begleitet.  Ohne jeden Zweifel wird die
wichtigste Vermittlungsfunktion heutzutage von Juristen ausgeuebt.

Aufgrund der ihr eigenen Dynamik erfasst die juristische Praxis jede
Art der allgemeinen Lebenspraxis, von multinationalen Geschaeften bis
hin zu individuellen Beziehungen.  In juengster Zeit sucht sie ihren
Platz in der Welt der neuen Medien, in der das Copyright und der
Konflikt zwischen privatem Recht und oeffentlichem Zugang der Loesung
beduerfen.  Man kann also nicht sagen, dass das Recht im Gegensatz zur
Politik nicht proaktiv ist.  Das Problem dabei ist, dass es in den
Kontext der Schriftkultur eingebunden bleibt, und zwar so, dass die
Form wichtiger als der Inhalt wird und am Wesentlichen vorbei zielt.
Frueher war Latein die Rechtssprache und erinnert daran, wo die
Rechtspraxis der westlichen Welt ihren Ursprung hat.  Heute koennen
nur wenige Rechtsanwaelte Latein.  Aber ihre eigene Sprache
beherrschen sie vorzueglich.

Juristenchinesisch wird mit dem Versuch gerechtfertigt, in einer
gegebenen Situation Doppeldeutigkeiten vermeiden zu muessen.  Daran
waere nichts falsch.  Es ist jedoch falsch, wenn die Rechtssprache und
die in der Rechtssprache kodifizierten Verfahren nicht der
pragmatischen Erwartung der Gerechtigkeit entsprechen.  Recht und
Gerechtigkeit sind nicht dasselbe, und jeder koennte hierfuer ein
Beispiel anfuehren.  Tatsaechlich dient das Recht der Schriftkultur
nicht der Gerechtigkeit.  Sein Zweck liegt oft genug daran, einen
Klienten freizusprechen.  Ist ein Anwalt des Rechts seinen Klienten
oder der Gerechtigkeit gegenueber verpflichtet?  Die Wirklichkeit
duerfte von der Erwartung der Buerger ziemlich weit entfernt sein.
Daher verliert die Justiz ihre Glaubwuerdigkeit, weil sie durch ihre
Praxis den Geist des Gesellschaftsvertrags aushoehlt.

Kritik an Richtern und Anwaelten ist so alt wie der Berufsstand.  Hier
moechte ich mich nicht einreihen.  Wichtig ist zu zeigen, dass selbst,
wenn Gerechtigkeit herrschen wuerde, die Gesetze und Methoden der
Justiz nicht fuer ewig gelten koennen.  Einige Taten, die die
Gesellschaft frueher akzeptierte--Kindesmisshandlung, sexuelle
Belaestigung, Rassendiskriminierung--, gelten heute als illegal und
als ungerecht.  Andere Verbrechen (Pfeifen am Sonntag, Kuessen des
Gatten in der OEffentlichkeit, Sonntagsarbeit, um einige Beispiele aus
den USA zu geben) werden nicht mehr als Rechtsbruch angesehen.
Entscheidend ist die Einsicht, dass sich mit den Veraenderungen der
Lebenspraxis die Bezugsrahmen veraendern--fuer Moral und fuer Legalitaet.

Haben Juristen diese neue Situation geschaffen?  Oder sind sie das
Ergebnis der neuen menschlichen Beziehungen, die sich aus neuen
pragmatischen Umstaenden ergeben haben?  Wer beurteilt, ob das
Justizsystem den neuen Erwartungen entspricht?  Keine dieser Fragen
ist leicht zu beantworten.  Wenn Justiz die menschlichen Erwartungen
gestalten soll, muss sie deren Wesen begreifen und widerspiegeln und
muss im Hinblick auf die Rechte, die die Menschen in neue praktische
Erfahrungen ihrer Selbstdefinition einbringen, ihre eigene
Perspektive definieren.  Es ist schoen und gut, wenn das Rechtssystem
Mittel verwendet wie DNABeweisstuecke, Videoaufnahmen und Internet,
die sich alle jenseits der Schriftkultur etabliert haben, aber wenn
sie dann alle den schriftkulturellen Winkelzuegen unterworfen werden,
ist die ganze Anstrengung umsonst gewesen.


Das programmierte Parlament

Praktische Politik bedeutet nicht Wahlen, sondern die alltaegliche
Routinearbeit zur Loesung von Aufgaben, die fuer die durch die Politik
vertretenen Menschen von Belang sind.  Wenn wir die Parteibindung
einmal ausser acht lassen, dann ist das Ziel die Erhaltung oder
Verbesserung des Gemeinwohls.  Die Gesetzgebung durch das Parlament
setzt eine Tradition fort, die vor der Schriftkultur liegt.  Dennoch
wurde eine effektive Gesetzgebung erst innerhalb des pragmatischen
Rahmens moeglich, der Schriftkultur hervorbrachte.  Sobald die
Schriftkultur ihr Potential erreicht hatte, wurden neue Mittel fuer
die politische Praxis der Gesetzgebung notwendig.  Hinter allem steht
die Erwartung, dass der Gesetzgebungsprozess den praktischen
Beduerfnissen Rechnung tragen sollte, die in einem Kontext raschen
Wandels auftreten.  Hier wie in anderen Bereichen kollidieren die
Kraefte, die am Werk sind.

Obwohl schriftkulturelle Perspektiven und Methoden der Gesetzgebung
nicht mehr ausreichend sind fuer Themen aus einem pragmatischen Rahmen,
der das schriftkulturelle Paradigma in Frage stellt, scheinen die
Politiker nicht willens zu sein, die Notwendigkeit des Wandels
einzusehen.  Sie finden es nuetzlicher--und leichter zu
rechtfertigen--, schriftkulturelle Bildung gesetzlich zu verstaerken,
statt das gesamte Bildungssystem auf den neuen Bedarf hin neu zu
bedenken.  Sie alle akzeptieren zwar Expertenwissen,
Informationsnetzwerke, bedienen sich dieser Mittel auch, um ihre
Programme zu verbreiten, arbeiten aber unter Beschraenkungen, die sich
aus der schriftkulturellen Praxis der Politik ergeben.  Dass in einem
Zeitalter grenzenloser Kommunikation Fraktionssprecher
hochkomplizierte politische Programme praktisch vor leeren Stuehlen
praesentieren, ist schwer vorzustellen.  Es faellt ebenfalls schwer zu
glauben, dass man dabei an einer Sprache festhaelt, die in Erfahrungen
laengst vergangener Zeiten wurzelt und die sich mehrfach als
ineffektiv erwiesen hat.  Viele parlamentarische Verfahren laufen
darueber hinaus nach einem Protokoll ab, das viel mit dem Vergangenen
und nichts mit der Gegenwart zu tun hat.  Wie im Falle der Justiz
sind Symbole offenbar wichtiger als Inhalte.

Dennoch gibt es unter dem Druck der Effizienzerwartungen auch
Veraenderungen.  Abgesehen von den durchaus nicht immer relevanten
Inhalten erschoepfen sich die Gesetzgebungsverfahren nicht mehr in
ueberzeugender Formulierung und formaler Logik.  Sie spiegeln
zunehmend die globalen Erwartungen wider und greifen gern auf
Vermittlungstechnologien und Aufgabenverteilungsstrategien oder
Interaktivitaet zurueck.  Elektronische Modellierung und
Simulationsmethoden werden ausprobiert.  Die neuen Methoden der
Informationsbeschaffung sparen den Parlamentariern viel Zeit.
Berater und Angestellte wenden leistungsstarke Wissensfilter an, um
nur die themenrelevanten Informationen in den politischen Prozess
einfliessen zu lassen.  Politiker wissen, dass Wissen--zur richtigen
Zeit und im richtigen Zusammenhang--Macht ist.  Die Mitglieder
computerisierter Parlamente wissen auch, dass jeder die Daten zur
Verfuegung hat, aber nur wenige diese effektiv verarbeiten oder
effektiv damit umgehen koennen.  Tatsaechlich entwickeln die Parteien
Bearbeitungsprogramme, die den Politikern in oeffentlichen
Diskussionen oder in Parlamentsdebatten ueberzeugendere Argumente an
die Hand geben.  Die durch die neue Technologie erzeugte Transparenz
stellt den oeffentlichen Zugang zur Diskussion sicher.  Politischer
Wettbewerb ist eine Frage des intelligenten Gebrauchs solcher Daten.
Macht ergibt sich aus der Faehigkeit zur Informationsverarbeitung,
nicht aus der Menge der gespeicherten Informationen.

Diese verkuerzte Darstellung klingt wie ein Vorgriff auf die Zukunft.
Das ist es aber nicht.  Zwar steht der Prozess noch am Anfang, aber er
ist unvermeidbar.  Er wird frueher oder spaeter solche Komponenten wie
Amtszeit--die lange Amtsdauer eines Volksvertreters spiegelt
schriftkulturelle Ideale wider--oeffentliche Evaluationsverfahren,
Kandidatur und Wahlmodus beeinflussen.  Er wird auch ein UEberdenken
der Beziehung zwischen Politikern und Wahlkreisen erfordern.  Auch
Motive und Methoden der Gesetzgebung und ihre Legitimitaet koennten
sinnvoll ueberdacht werden.  Erhoehte Vermittlung beeinflusst den
Zusammenhang zwischen Fakten und politischen Taten.  Wenn die neuen
Kommunikationsmittel keine persoenliche Interaktion zwischen
Politikern und Waehlern gestatten, wird die OEffentlichkeit weiterhin
von der Politik entfremdet bleiben.  Politik in den Massenmedien
gehoert bereits der Vergangenheit an--nicht weil das Fernsehen vom
Internet ueberholt worden ist, sondern wegen der Notwendigkeit, die
individuelle Motivierung zum politischen Handeln zu foerdern.
Politische Effizienz beruht auf menschlicher Interaktion.  Nicht das
Medium zaehlt, sondern das, was durch das Medium erreicht wird.

Einen Gesetzesrahmen zu schaffen, der dieser neuen Natur der
menschlichen Beziehungen und dem neuen pragmatischen Kontext Rechnung
traegt, heisst, das Wesen der Prozesse zu verstehen, die den Umbruch
herbeigefuehrt haben.  Die Konsolidierung der Buerokratie hilft diesem
Verstaendnis genauso wenig wie die Beibehaltung der Monarchie und des
Oberhauses in Grossbritannien.  Einen Sinn fuer diesen Prozess kann man
nur dann entwickeln, wenn der politische Prozess selbst auf die
vorherrschende Pragmatik abgestimmt wird.


Eine Schlacht, die wir gewinnen muessen

Als Kunst der Koalitionsbildung (und -aufloesung) ist die Politik
heute eine Epitomisierung allgemeiner menschlicher Praxis.
Berufspolitiker entwickeln Strategien fuer die Koalitionsbildung und
finden die effektivsten Interaktionsmuster fuer ein bestimmtes
politisches Ziel heraus.  Sie entwickeln eine eigene Sprache und
eigene Kriterien der Effizienzbewertung fuer ihre hochspezialisierte
Praxis.

Die Effizienzbesessenheit in der Politik und anderswo kommt nicht von
Kraeften, die ausserhalb von uns liegen.  Und die UEbertragung von
Verantwortlichkeiten fuehrt nicht zu enttaeuschten Politikern,
Philosophen oder Paedagogen.  Die kuerzeren politischen Zyklen, die wir
heute antreffen, entsprechen der Dynamik einer Praxis, die sich auf
das Unmittelbare im Rahmen eines globalen Daseins konzentriert.
Offenbar vollzieht sich ein UEbergang vom begrenzten kommunalen Leben,
das nach Kontinuitaet und Bestaendigkeit strebt, zu einer globalen
Gemeinschaft interagierender Individuen, deren Identitaet selbst
variabel ist und die bereit sind, sich auf Diskontinuitaet und Wandel
einzulassen.  In diesem Universum koennen die Handlungen nicht mehr
ueber grosse integrative Mechanismen wie Sprache oder Behoerden
koordiniert werden.  Eine Alternative hierzu waeren begrenzte
Operationen, die ihrem Wesen nach Koalitionen entsprechen wuerden, die
man durch Meinungsumfragen oder elektronische Stimmabgabe vorab
testet und die man den raschen Veraenderungen anpassen koennte.  Auch
das geschieht inzwischen.

Monarchien symbolisieren die Ewigkeit der Herrschaft; Vertraege unter
Monarchen sollten die Monarchen ueberleben.  Der Zugang zu einer 15
Minuten waehrenden politischen Macht, der in einigen Teilen der Welt
alles andere als eine Metapher darstellt, ist so wichtig wie jede
andere Form der Beruehmtheit, da politische Prozesse und
Machtverhaeltnisse immer weniger miteinander zu tun haben und von der
Fixierung auf Universalitaet und Zeitlosigkeit befreit sind.  Eine 15
Minuten bestehende Koalition ist so entscheidend wie der Zugang zur
Macht und so nuetzlich wie die von den daran beteiligten Menschen
akzeptierten neuen Prinzipien.  Statt eines Top-down-Modells finden
wir in der Politik zunehmend eine Kombination von Top-down- und
Bottom-up-Modellen.  Unter diesen Umstaenden bleibt die
Koalitionsbildung eine der wenigen verbliebenen wichtigen politischen
Aufgaben.  Die Zentren der politischen Macht--Wirtschaft, Recht,
Interessengruppen--stellen Pole dar, um die solche Koalitionen
gebildet oder aufgeloest werden.  Die neue Mitte in Deutschland ist
nur ein Name fuer eine Koalitionsbildung.  An und fuer sich kann man
schwer die Linke in der Mitte plazieren.

Man muss sich fragen, ob solche Koalitionen nicht in der universalen
Sprache der Schriftkultur entstehen koennen.  Die Schriftkultur wird
ja mit dem Argument verteidigt, dass sie einen gemeinsamen Nenner
darstellt.  Was man dabei vergisst, ist der Umstand, dass Koalitionen
nicht unabhaengig von ihrem Ausdrucksmedium sind.  Auf Schriftkultur
beruhende Koalitionen verfolgen Ziele und Handlungen, die mit dem sie
erfordernden pragmatischen Rahmen im Einklang stehen.  Beduerfnisse,
die mit diesem pragmatischen Kontext nicht uebereinstimmen, erfordern
andere Mittel der Koalitionsbildung.  Wenn die Fuehrer der
wirtschaftlich staerksten Industrielaender sich auf feste Wechselkurse
einigen oder wenn Freund und Feind eine politische Koalition gegen
eine Invasion eingehen, die einen Praezedenzfall schaffen und
Konsequenzen fuer die globale Wirtschaft haben koennte, dann kann es
den Anschein haben, als seien schriftkulturelle Mittel verwendet
worden.  Tatsaechlich aber sind diese Mittel weitgehend wort- und
schriftlos.  Sie ergeben sich aus Datenverarbeitung und
Verhaltenssimulation auf Finanzmaerkten, aus Szenarien der virtuellen
Wirklichkeit, die zu Handlungen fuehren, die kein Drehbuch vorher
beschreiben koennte.  Waehrend die Politiker vielleicht noch nach einem
Drehbuch handeln, waehlen die Machtzentren die effizientesten Mittel,
um neue Koalitionen zu evaluieren.  Folglich besteht kaum ein
Zusammenhang zwischen der Autoritaet politischer Institutionen, die
auf schriftkulturellen Voraussetzungen beruhen, und der Dynamik von
Koalitionen, die den pragmatischen Rahmen jenseits der Schriftkultur
widerspiegeln.

Das Gefuehl vom Anfang geht weit ueber die neuen Staaten, die neuen
politischen Mittel oder die Kunst der Koalitionsbildung hinaus.  Es
ist ein Neuanfang fuer das neue zoon politikon, fuer ein
gesellschaftliches Wesen, das die meisten seiner gesellschaftlichen
Wurzeln verloren hat und dessen menschliche Natur wohl eher mit
politischen Trieben als mit kulturellen Leistungen zu definieren ist.
Kultur spielt eigentlich keine Rolle mehr.  Kultur kann man
schliesslich nicht mit sich herumtragen.  Aber man kann auch sein
Dasein nicht ohne politische Mittel aushandeln, die dem neuen
gesellschaftlichen Zustand entsprechen, welcher sich strukturell von
allem Vorausgegangenen unterscheidet.  Das auf sich zentrierte
Individuum kann nicht umhin, mit anderen in Beziehung zu treten und
sich in bezug auf sie zu definieren: "We Am a Virtual Community"
("Wir bin eine virtuelle Gemeinschaft") ist nicht nur ein
anspielungsreicher Titel (von Earl Babble) eines Artikels ueber
Interaktionen im Internet, sondern eine genaue Beschreibung der
heutigen politischen Welt.  Die spezifischen Beziehungsformen, gerade
auch die Wir-binFraktion, sind vielen Faktoren unterworfen, nicht
zuletzt der biologischen und kognitiven Neudefinition des Menschen.
Wenn alles, buchstaeblich alles, moeglich und akzeptabel ist, muss das
zoon politikon neue Wege fuer seine Entscheidungen und Ziele finden,
ohne dabei Gefahr zu laufen, seine Identitaet zu verlieren.  Das ist
wohl die entscheidende politische Schlacht, die die Menschen noch
gewinnen muessen.



Kapitel 6:


Gehorsam ist alles

Elektronische Hochpraezisionsaugen auf erdumkreisenden Satelliten
nahmen das Abfeuern der Rakete und die Startparameter auf.  Daten
wurden zur Verarbeitung an ein Computerzentrum weitergeleitet, die
verarbeiteten Informationen, Spezifizierungswinkel, Abfeuerungszeit
und Flugbahn wurden an AntiRaketenflugkoerper weitergegeben, die auf
das Abfangen von Feindattacken programmiert waren.  Das System--eine
riesige verteilte gut verbundene Konfiguration--vereinigt Sachwissen
aus elektronischen Sichtvorrichtungen, in einer Software kodiertes
Wissen, mit deren Hilfe man Raketenumlaufbahnen (auf der Grundlage
von Startzeit, Position, Winkel, Geschwindigkeit, Gewicht und
meteorologischen Gegebenheiten) berechnen kann, schnelle
UEbertragungsnetze und automatische Positionierung sowie
Ausloesevorrichtungen.

Dieses integrierte System hat schriftgebundene Formen der praktischen
Kriegsfuehrung ersetzt.  Statt der Handbuecher, die frueher viele fuer
das Militaerpersonal wichtige Parameter und Einsaetze beschrieben haben,
enthalten jetzt Computerprogramme diese Informationen.  Die
Programme eruebrigen lange Ausbildungszeiten, teure Militaermanoever und
die staendige UEberpruefung von Handbuechern auf ihre Aktualitaet.
Verteiltes Wissen und Vernetzung haben den Befehl von oben ersetzt.
Das beschriebene System enthaelt eine Vielzahl von
Vermittlungskomponenten, die hoechst effiziente Kriege ermoeglichen.

Weitere Episoden aus dem Golfkrieg liefern Beispiele, die der
relativen Vernichtung der beruechtigten (und ineffektiven)
SCUD-Raketen aehneln, so z. B. die insgesamt 100 Stunden dauernde
sogenannte Bodenschlacht.  Diese Schlacht veranschaulichte die
toedliche Kraft von Artillerie und Panzern, die Effizienz der
Modellierung und der Simulation sowie Planungs- und Testmethoden, die
unabhaengig von schriftlich fixierter Militaerstrategie und -taktik
operieren.  Die Armee des Feindes war nach Prinzipien organisiert,
die aus dem pragmatischen Rahmen der Schriftlichkeit hergeleitet
waren: zentralisierte Kommandostrukturen, eine strenge Hierarchie,
moderne Militaerausruestung, die Teil eines hauptsaechlich sequentiellen
und deterministischen Kriegsplans war und auf einer Logik
langfristiger Auseinandersetzungen aufbaute.


Der erste Krieg jenseits der Schriftkultur

Dieses Kapitel wurde--die einleitenden Zeilen ausgenommen--konzipiert,
als niemand den Konflikt im Arabischen Golf unter Beteiligung
amerikanischer Truppen voraussah.  Im Verlauf dieses Krieges wurden
alle theoretischen Argumente zur Institution des Militaers jenseits
der Schriftkultur einem leibhaftigen Test unterzogen, vermutlich weit
ueber unser aller Erwartungen und Wuensche hinaus.  Der in den Medien
dargestellte Golfkrieg erinnerte an ein Computerspiel oder eine
Fernsehshow.  Beim Zuschauen gewann ich den Eindruck, als ob jemand
einen Teil meines Textes genommen und ueber die Nachrichtenkanaele
uebertragen haette.  Die Geschichte gab gute Schlagzeilen ab; aber aus
dem Kontext gerissen, bzw. auf den Kontext einer auf einen
Fernsehbildschirm reduzierten Wirklichkeit beschraenkt, blieb ihre
Gesamtbedeutung unklar.  In mancherlei Hinsicht wurde der bewaffnete
Konflikt letztlich trivialisiert, eine weitere Vorabendserie, ein
Zuschauersport.  Andere Berichterstattungen informierten ueber die
Frustrationen in der Truppe hinsichtlich der knappen Zahl an
Telefonleitungen.  Auch hiess es, dass der traditionelle Brief durch
die Videokassette ersetzt wurde.  Wir erfuhren ebenfalls von einer
fast schon magischen Vorrichtung namens CNX, die allen, die auf
diesem riesigen Wuestenkriegsschauplatz dienten, zur Orientierung
verhalf.  Man berichtete desweiteren ueber die vorgefertigten
Lebensmittel mit ihren exotischen Namen und ueber den Zeitvertreib der
Truppen.

Schliesslich geriet der Kontext mehr in den Mittelpunkt der
Aufmerksamkeit.  Dies sollte der erste Krieg einer Zivilisation
jenseits der Schriftkultur werden: eine aeusserst effiziente (das Wort
erhaelt hier eine ungewollt zynische Konnotation) Aktivitaet, die nicht
sequentielle, groesstenteils parallel verlaufende praktische
Erfahrungen beinhaltet.  Hierfuer war praezise Synchronisation (jedes
Versagen kostete Opfer vor dem euphemistisch umschriebenen
"verbuendeten Feuer"), verteilte Entscheidungsfindung, intensive
Vermittlung, hoechste Spezialisierung und Aufgabenverteilung notwendig.
Diese Merkmale verkoerperten eine Ideologie von relativem Wert, die
vom politischen Diskurs und moralischen Prinzipien losgeloest war.
Niemand erwartete von diesem Krieg, dass er Pfeil und Bogen oder gar
das Rad neu erfinden wuerde.  Moeglicherweise hatten einige Offiziere
von einem Buch mit dem Titel Die Kunst des Kriegs (verfasst von Sun
Tzu 325 v.  Chr. oder frueher) schon einmal gehoert oder von anderen
einschlaegigen Buechern, die die Bibliotheken der Militaerakademien und
der renommierten Forschungseinrichtungen fuellen.  Aber dieser Krieg
wurde nicht fuer das Buch, im Namen des einen Buches (Koran oder
Bibel) gefuehrt, und auch nicht auf eine Art und Weise, wie sie in
Buechern beschrieben ist.  In gewisser Weise war der Golfkrieg
wahrhaftig die "Mutter aller Schlachten", indem er die Regeln des
Krieges neu formulierte--oder sich von ihnen verabschiedete.

Alle Merkmale der Zivilisation jenseits der Schriftkultur finden sich
in den praktischen Erfahrungen des heutigen Militaers.
Hochvermittelte Praxis mit Hilfe von digitalen Speichern und Abrufen
von Informationen; die Abloesung frueherer wirtschaftlicher Knappheit
in Kriegszeiten durch einen UEberfluss an Verteidigungs- und
Zerstoerungseinrichtungen; Ersatz der kriegsrelevanten Fakten (deren
Ermittlung das Eindringen in feindliches Terrain erforderte) durch
Bilder und Bildverarbeitungstechnologien; eine Verschiebung von einer
hierarchischen Struktur strenger Autoritaets- und Befehlslinien zu
einem relativ offenen Kontext, der die Entscheidung den einzelnen
Soldaten weitgehend ueberlaesst; an Stelle von Entbehrung und Isolation
von allen nicht-militaerischen Bereichen (Bedingungen, die frueher als
Teil einer Militaerkarriere akzeptiert waren), Freizeit und
Vergnuegungen, die sich aus der allgemeinen Permissivitaet der
Gesellschaft ergaben.  Dass einige dieser Erwartungen unerfuellt
blieben, wurde kritisiert, aber nicht wirklich verstanden.  Die
Gastgeber der amerikanischen Armee leben nach anderen Massstaeben.  Das
muslimische Gesetz verbietet Alkohol und bestimmte Formen der
Unterhaltung ebenso wie das Beerdigen von Unglaeubigen in einem Land,
das sich als heilig versteht.

Der Golfkrieg war an seinen verschiedenen Fronten kein Krieg
unvereinbarer Religionen, Moralvorstellungen oder Kulturen.  Es
handelte sich um einen Konflikt zwischen einer kuenstlich erhaltenen
Schriftkultur, in der reiche OElvorraete als Puffer gegen
Effizienzmassnahmen in allen Bereichen des Lebens dienten, und einer
anderen Zivilisation, die durch Schriftlosigkeit sowie durch eine
nach Energie duerstende, globale Wirtschaft mit hoher Effizienzdynamik
gekennzeichnet ist.  Die Schlussoffensive mag Kriegsgeschichtler und
Militaerstrategen an das UEberraschungsmanoever des Epaminondas (371 v.
Chr.) in der Schlacht von Leuctra erinnert haben: statt eines
Frontalangriffs ein Angriff auf eine Flanke.  General Schwartzkopf
ist kein Epaminondas.  Seine Mission war erfolgreich, weil die
Aufgaben in einer internationalen Armee--eher ein Fluch als ein
Segen--verteilt waren, was zu vielen Flanken fuehrte.  Helmuth von
Moltke aenderte im deutsch-franzoesischen Krieg (1870/71) die
Befehlsstruktur zu den untergebenen Offizieren, indem er sie unter
sehr weitgefassten Richtlinien agieren liess.  Die Generaele und
Kommandeure der zahlreichen am Golfkrieg beteiligten Armeen nutzten
die Vorteile der Netzwerke und fuehrten einen Angriff mit hoechst
effizienten und kostspieligen Vernichtungstechnologien nach einem
Plan, der von den heutigen Computern wiederholt simuliert wurde.

Da ich aber schon eingeraeumt habe, dass ich einen Grossteil dieses
Kapitels drei Jahre vor dem Golfkrieg geschrieben habe, koennte man
einwenden, dass ich den Krieg durch die Brille meiner Hypothese
betrachtet und nur das gesehen habe, was ich sehen wollte, um mein
Modell bestaetigt zu sehen.  Ich glaube aber, dass ich die
Argumentation in der urspruenglichen Fassung beibehalten sollte, so
dass die Ergebnisse die angebotenen Antworten kommentieren moegen.


Krieg als praktische Erfahrung

"Der Krieg ist die Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln",
schrieb Carl von Clausewitz (UEber den Krieg, 1818).  Es ist schwierig,
dem zu widersprechen, aber man koennte diese Feststellung historisch
relativieren und folgendermassen paraphrasieren: Krieg ist die
Fortsetzung des UEberlebenskampfes einer Gesellschaft, die die
verfuegbaren Ressourcen zu kontrollieren und zu verteilen beansprucht.
Entsprechend orientiert sich der Kampf an den Strukturen anderer
praktischer Erfahrungen.  Die Jagd--eine fruehe Kampferfahrung ohne
menschlichen Gegner--erforderte Waffen, die schliesslich auch zum
Krieg taugten.  Es waren die Werkzeuge, die die primitiven Menschen
nutzten, um Nahrung zum eigenen UEberleben und fuer das UEberleben der
Gemeinschaft zu beschaffen.  Zukuenftige Aspekte dieser Aktivitaeten
und die damit assoziierten moralischen Werte lassen uns manchmal
vergessen, dass die synkretistische Natur der Menschen, d. h. die
Projektion natuerlicher Anlagen in die praktische Erfahrung, im
Synkretismus der benutzten Werkzeuge zum Ausdruck kommt.  Dieser
Synkretismus ergab sich aus der Arbeitsteilung, deren fruehes Ergebnis
der Berufssoldat ist.

In dem Masse, in dem sich die militaerischen Werkzeuge von den
Arbeitswerkzeugen zu unterscheiden begannen, trat eine konzeptuelle
Komponente (Taktik und Strategie) hinzu.  Sie bestand aus einer
bestimmten Abfolge, einer eigenen Logik und einer Methode, auf
Feindesmanoever zu reagieren.  Von Clausewitz betonte ausdruecklich,
dass der Krieg eine Fortsetzung der Politik ist; fruehere AEusserungen zu
diesem Thema behandelten den Krieg als Teil der Lebenspraxis.  Zwei
byzantinische Herrscher, Maurice (539-602) und Leo der Weise
(836-911) versuchten militaerische Strategien und Taktiken pragmatisch
zu begruenden.  Ihnen zufolge bestimmt der pragmatische Rahmen die
Natur des Konflikts, die Kriegsbedingungen und die Waffen.
Tatsaechlich stand jede uns bekannte Veraenderung in der militaerischen
Ausruestung im Einklang mit den Veraenderungen der Praxiserfahrungen
einer Gesellschaft.  Die Erfindung des Steigbuegels durch die Chinesen
(600) verbesserte deren Reitkuenste.  Dies ermoeglichte eine
Kriegsfuehrung, in der das Rueckgrat der Schlachtformation nicht mehr
aus Fusssoldaten, sondern aus berittenen Soldaten bestand.
Mechanische Apparate (z. B. das im Jahr 1100 erwaehnte Trebuchet) zum
Schleudern grosser Steine oder anderer Wurfgeschosse verlagerten die
Kriegsanstrengungen von umfangreichen Verteidigungsmassnahmen (die vor
dem 14. Jahrhundert erbauten Festungen, Stadtmauern und Burgen) hin
zu Offensivstrategien.  Das gleiche galt fuer die Kanonen, die die
Tuerken bei der Eroberung Konstantinopels (1453) einsetzten.  Aber
nicht die militaerische Praxis als solche interessiert uns, sondern
ihre Bedeutung fuer die Sprache und die Schriftkultur.

In einer begrenzten Skala menschlicher Aktivitaeten mit vielen
autarken, kleinen Gruppen bestand kaum ein Bedarf an organisierter
Kriegsfuehrung oder an speziell ausgebildeten Soldaten.  Rudimentaere
militaerische Praxis mit ihren beiden Komponenten von Angriff und
Verteidigung wurde erst in einer erweiterten Skala relevant.  Diese
Entwicklung vollzog sich parallel zur Entstehung der Sprache,
besonders der Schrift.  Das erwaehnte Buch von Sun Tzu und weitere
fruehe Zeugnisse von Kriegen (in Mythologie, religioesen Werken, Epen
und philosophischen Texten) sind hier zu nennen.  Diese militaerische
Praxis vereinte UEberlebenstechniken und -werkzeuge, wie zum Beispiel
Jagen und die Abgrenzung und Bewachung des Gebiets, das die Nahrung
lieferte.

Das Bewusstsein von den verfuegbaren Ressourcen entsprach dem
Bewusstsein der Skala.  Die Skala, die aus einem Mitglied einer
Lebensgemeinschaft auch einen Krieger machte, ergab sich aus den
fruehen Siedlungsformen, dem erhoehten Bedarf an Nahrungsmitteln, aus
groesserer Produktivitaet und Besitzanhaeufung--woraus sich wiederum die
Notwendigkeit herleitete, die Sprachverwendung ueber die Unmittelkeit
der Muendlichkeit hinaus zu entwickeln.  Die Effizienz von Arbeit und
Kampf war in etwa auf der gleichen Ebene angesiedelt.  In gewisser
Weise dauerten Kriege ewig; der Frieden war nur eine Erholungspause
zwischen den militaerischen Auseinandersetzungen.  Gefangenschaft
(meist gleichbedeutend mit Sklaverei) unterstrich die Bedeutung
menschlicher Arbeitskraft und Tuechtigkeit fuer die Sicherung einer
Gemeinschaft, die Vermehrung des Reichtums der Maechtigen und den
Lebensunterhalt aller anderen.  Auch die soziale Struktur des
Militaers war an Effizienz und Vermittlung gebunden.  Zwar wurde die
Kampfeffizienz in Groessenordnungen von gezielter Zerstoerung oder
Bewahrung (des Lebens und lebenswichtiger Einrichtungen) gemessen,
sie umfasste jedoch auch Verteidigungsmassnahmen, deren Ziel es war,
Zerstoerungen durch den Feind gering zu halten oder zu verhindern.

Waehrend einzelne Konflikte keine weitere ueber die Muendlichkeit
hinausgehende Sprache erforderten, wurde bei Konflikten zwischen
groesseren Gruppen der Bedarf nach einem Koordinierungsinstrument
deutlich.  Neue Woerter und Konstruktionen bezeugen derartige
Konflikte und die mit ihnen assoziierten magisch-mythischen
Manifestationen.  Die Sprache projizierte diese Erfahrung auf den
Hintergrund verschiedener anderer Praxiserfahrungen.  Schon immer
besassen Armeen jeglicher Art, unter jeder Regierungsform, wegen ihrer
besonderen Funktion einen Sonderstatus in der Gesellschaft.
Natuerlich hat die Schrift keine Armeen geschaffen, aber sie bot doch
(selbst in den rudimentaersten Notationsformen) die Voraussetzung
dafuer.  Die Schrift beeinflusste die Kriegsfuehrung: als Auflistung von
Mitteln und Menschen, als Bericht ueber Kriegshandlungen und deren
Folgen, als Planungsinstrument.  Alle Bestandteile dieser Institution
objektivieren den Zweck des Krieges in einer bestimmten Zeit.  Sie
objektivieren zudem die Beziehungen innerhalb einer Gesellschaft, und,
waehrend Friedenszeiten, zwischen einer Gesellschaft und ihren
Soldaten.  Die Objektivierung vollzieht sich durch die Sprache.  Die
Sequenzialitaet der Schrift und die Notwendigkeit, konfliktbezogene
militaerische Ablaeufe auszudruecken, gehoeren zusammen.  Das Zitat von
Clausewitz ist nur die sprachliche Fortschreibung der vielen Aspekte
des Krieges.

"Konnte Gideon hebraeisch lesen?  Konnte Deborah es?", moegen jetzt
manche mit Blick auf die Heerfuehrer des Alten Testaments fragen.
Andere koennten Beispiele aus den griechischen Epen und den Chroniken
des Nahen Osten anfuehren.  Die roemische Mythologie und die Zeugnisse
des Islam geben keinen Aufschluss darueber, ob all ihre Krieger lesen
und schreiben konnten.  Aber sie geben uns Aufschluesse ueber die
Umstaende, die zur Einrichtung einer Armee als eine eigenstaendige
Institution in Fortsetzung der synchretistischen Praxiserfahrung
fuehrten, und darueber, wie sich diese Institution allmaehlich ihren
eigenen Daseinsbereich und ihre eigene Daseinsberechtigung schuf.

Die Veraenderungen in der Kriegsfuehrung entsprechen den
unterschiedlichen Ebenen der Schriftkultur: von dem persoenlichen
Kampf zwischen zwei Kriegern, der kaum Sprache verlangte und mit dem
Sieg des Staerkeren endete, hin zu den kriegerischen
Auseinandersetzungen zwischen vielen Menschen, bei denen hoch
entwickelte Technologien--die ebenfalls wenig Sprache
erforderte--eine entscheidende Rolle spielte.  In jenen Formen der
kriegerischen Auseinandersetzung, in denen sich zwei Armeen direkt
gegenueberstanden, trug die Sprache die entscheidenden
Koordinationsleistungen.  Zur Bestimmung der Kriegsziele, zur
Formulierung und Verbreitung der Plaene, auch zur Veraenderung der
Plaene an veraenderte Bedingungen war die Sprache mindestens ebenso
wichtig wie die Zahl der Pferde, die Qualitaet der Waffen und der
Munition.  Wie beim Jaeger lag die Faehigkeit des Soldaten im Angriff
und in der Verteidigung und darin, bei sich veraendernden
Machtverhaeltnissen die Mittel an die Ziele anzupassen.  Die ersten
und vermutlich die meisten Kriege wurden gefuehrt, bevor es eine
allgemein verbreitete Schriftkultur gab.  Die bedeutendsten uns
bekannten Krieger alter Zeiten--die aegyptischen Pharaonen Thutmosis
III. in der Schlacht um Meggido (1479 v.  Chr.), Ramses II. in der
Schlacht bei Kadesch gegen die Hethiter, Nebukadnezar und Darius, die
Spartaner unter Leonidas (480 v.  Chr.), Alexander der Grosse (bei der
Eroberung Babylons 330 v.  Chr.), Julius Caesar (49-46 v.  Chr.) und
Octavian (31 v.  Chr.) und die zahllosen chinesischen Krieger aus
dieser und spaeterer Zeit--benoetigten fuer ihre Kriege keine
Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur.  Ihre Strategien ergaben sich aus
den gleichen Erwartungen und pragmatischen Notwendigkeiten, die
schliesslich zur Herausbildung der Schrift fuehrten.

Kriege wurden gefuehrt auf gut ausgewaehltem Terrain, von Soldaten, die
Befehle ausfuehrten, die einem begrenzten Befehlsrepertoire entnommen
wurden.  In der Terminologie der generativen Grammatik: Es gab eine
eingeschraenkte Sprache des Krieges mit nicht allzuvielen
Moeglichkeiten zur Generierung von Kriegssaetzen.  Als sich mit den
verbesserten Arbeits- und Produktionsmethoden die Mittel der
Kriegsfuehrung mehrten, konnten die Befehlshabenden mehr Kriegstexte,
mehr Drehbuecher schreiben.  Mit zunehmender Kriegseffizienz stieg
auch die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Zusammenbruchs der militaerischen
Anstrengungen aufgrund mangelnder Integration und Koordination.  Die
militaerische Struktur spiegelte die Merkmale einer menschlichen
Praxis wider, die zur Schriftsprache und spaeter zur Schriftkultur
fuehrte: eine relativ geringe Dynamik; zentralisierte, hierarchische
Organisationsformen; ein geringes Anpassungsniveau; eine strikt
sequentielle Handlungsweise und eine deterministische Mentalitaet.
Durch die Jahrhunderte hindurch entwickelte sich mit dem Fortschritt
von Wissenschaft und Technologie die Waffentechnik und
Militaerstrategie weiter.

Der Rahmen, der das Ideal der Schriftkultur schuf, beruehrte nicht nur
die technische Kriegsfuehrung, sondern auch die Strategie, nach der
Kriege ausgespielt wurden.  Ungeschuetzte vorrueckende Linien waren
Teil einer Konfrontationsdynamik, die die im alltaeglichen Leben
vorherrschende Linearitaet widerspiegelte.  Eine Reihe nach der
anderen feuerte ihre Salven ab und ging dann zum entscheidenden
Bajonettangriff ueber.  Die Struktur der Schrift (Sequenzen,
Hierarchie, Akkumulation, Abschluss) und die Struktur dieses
besonderen Militaereinsatzes aehneln einander.  Schriftkundigkeit
gehoerte erst sehr spaet zum Qualitaetsprofil eines Soldaten.  Nachdem
sie aber erst einmal Bestandteil der militaerischen
Selbstkonstituierung war, veraenderte sie die Kriegsfuehrung und
erhoehte die militaerische Effizienz.  Nun handelte es sich nicht mehr
um Gefechte zwischen verfehdeten Feudalherren, sondern um grosse
Konflikte zwischen Nationen.  Diese Konflikte wurden zwar seltener,
gewannen aber an Intensitaet.  Ihre Dauer entsprach den relativ langen
Produktions-, Verteilungsund Verbrauchszyklen, die die
schriftkulturelle Praxis kennzeichnen.

Der Krieg wurde bestimmten Regeln unterworfen.  Er wurde zivilisiert,
zumindest in einigen Aspekten.  Die katholische Kirche als Hueter der
Schriftkultur im Mittelalter, in dem viele kleinere Kriege zwischen
verfehdeten Feudalherren ausgetragen wurden, uebernahm dabei die
Fuehrung.  Zum Schutz von Nahrung und Leben in den barbarischen
Gesellschaften Europas nach dem Zusammenbruch des Roemischen Reiches
versuchte die einzig wirksame Machthierarchie, die Soldaten mit den
schriftkulturellen Gesetzen der Kirche zu baendigen.  Die weltlichen
Herrscher akzeptierten diese Vorschriften, nicht ohne eigene
pragmatische UEberlegungen im Hinterkopf.  Man brauchte ein
Jahrtausend um zu begreifen, dass ein Krieg niemals endgueltige
Ergebnisse zeitigt.  Aber man lernte auch, dass Kriegserfahrung neues
Wissen schuf (etwa ueber die verwendeten Mittel, ueber klimatische
Strukturen und geographische Territorien, ueber Merkmale des Feindes)
und Kreativitaet freilegte--was man die Kunst des Krieges nennt.  Im
Angesicht von Tod und Zerstoerung sind Kriege jedoch auch die
erbarmungslosesten Schulen unseres Lebens.


Das Militaer als Institution

Theodor Heuss nannte die allgemeine Wehrpflicht das Kind der
Demokratie.  Die allgemeine Wehrpflicht wurde in der franzoesischen
Revolution eingefuehrt--Levee en masse von 1793. Der Buergersoldat
ersetzte Soeldner und Berufssoldaten.  Der Ruf "Aux armes, mes
citoyens", der zu einer Strophe der franzoesischen Nationalhymne wurde,
glorifizierte die Hoffnungen jenes Augenblicks.  Preussen folgte dem
Beispiel aus wirtschaftlichen Gruenden: billige Menschenkraft fuer den
Krieg. Auf dem langen Weg, eine gesellschaftliche Institution zu
werden, erhielt das Militaer die Unterstuetzung des Staates, den es
verteidigte, oder der privaten Institutionen (Kirche, Landbesitzer,
Kaufleute), die seine Dienste benoetigten.

Im Gegenzug richtete die Institution ihre Strukturen an den
praktischen Erfahrungen der Menschen aus und erhoehte ihre Effizienz.
An jedem entscheidenden Entwicklungspunkt des Menschen musste das
Militaer eine Effizienz beweisen, die es als entscheidenden Faktor bei
der Verteidigung der Ressourcen rechtfertigte.  Wenn die Effizienz
nicht mehr genuegte und das Militaer die sozio-oekonomischen Fundamente
zu sehr belastete, wurde es gestuerzt, wie wir es an Militaerdiktaturen
immer wieder beobachten koennen.

Wie andere stark strukturierte Handlungsbereiche des Menschen
identifizierte sich das Militaer durch repetitive Handlungsformen.
Jede einzelne Handlung konnte verstanden werden als eine gegebene
Menge von weiteren Aufgaben oder Befehlen, die wiederum mit
bestimmten Motivationen und Rechtfertigungen verbunden waren und die
insgesamt die dem Militaer spezifische Arbeitspraxis darstellten.
Einige dieser Strukturen bezogen sich auf das Leben innerhalb dieser
Organisation, etwa die Moeglichkeit der Befoerderung oder die
Beeinflussung zukuenftiger Handlungen.  Sie waren intern in dem Sinne,
dass sie von den impliziten Regeln abhingen, die diese Institution
sich gegeben hatte.  Andere waren externer Art und drueckten das
Verhaeltnis zwischen Militaer und Gesellschaft aus: Symbolstatus,
Machtbeteiligung, Akzeptanzerwartungen.

Entwicklungen im militaerischen Bereich fuehrten zu Veraenderungen in
der Sprache, die die fuer die militaerische Praxis charakteristischen
Interaktionen definierte und modifizierte.  Die Sprache passte sich
zunehmend dem militaerischen Ziel--dem Sieg--an und loeste sich von der
alltaeglichen Sprache, die Traeger jenes Diskurses war, in dem sich die
Kriegsgruende herauskristallisierten.  Dementsprechend fanden auch die
Beziehungen zur Aussenwelt--zu den zukuenftigen Militaerangehoerigen, zu
den sozialen, politischen und kulturellen Institutionen und zur
Kirche--in einer Sprache statt, die sich von der alltaeglichen Sprache
immer weiter entfernte.

Mit den Veraenderungen in der Struktur der Lebenspraxis und mit den
Veraenderungen, die aus einer wachsenden Skala resultierten, ergaben
sich auch Veraenderungen im Militaerbereich.  Wenn sich die Individuen
ueberwiegend als schriftkulturell gebildete Individuen konstituierten,
musste auch das Militaer die Erwartungen und Merkmale der Schriftkultur
uebernehmen.  Vermutlich ergaben sich daraus die ersten
Militaerakademien.  Von Moltkes UEberlegungen ueber veraenderte
Verhaeltnisse zwischen Offizieren und Untergebenen nahmen viele
Fortschritte in der Kriegstechnologie vorweg: den Einsatz
dampfgetriebener Kriegsschiffe (durch die Japaner im Krieg gegen
Russland 1905); die Einfuehrung von Radio, Telefon und automotivem
Transport (im Ersten Weltkrieg); und das (von Erich Lindendorf
entwickelte) Konzept des totalen Krieges.  Alle Entwicklungen ergaben
sich in einem pragmatischen Rahmen, in dem Schriftkultur noetig war
und in dem sich die Merkmale der Schriftkultur in allen Formen der
Lebenspraxis widerspiegeln.  Der totale Krieg ist seiner Struktur
nach der Vorstellung von einer universalen Bildung und Schriftkultur
aehnlich: in der Forderung, das eine einzige Schriftkultur und Bildung
alle anderen zu ersetzen habe.  Und die stillschweigende Erwartung
der Dauerhaftigkeit der Institution, die sich in den Regeln und
Bestimmungen, den Hierarchien und zentralistischen Strukturen
niederschlaegt, aehnelt denen von Staat, Industrie, Religion,
Bildungswesen, Wissenschaft, Kunst und Literatur.  Das gleiche gilt
fuer Zentralismus, Hierarchie und Disziplin.  Das erklaert im uebrigen,
warum fast alle Armeen dieser Welt aehnliche, auf Schriftkultur
basierende Strukturen angenommen haben.  Im Gegensatz dazu sind zum
Beispiel Guerillakriege insofern ‘analphabetisch’, als sie nicht auf
den Konventionen der Schriftkultur beruhen.  Sie entfalten sich
dezentralisiert und gruenden auf der Dynamik sich selbst
organisierender kleiner Zentren.  Deshalb werden sie von allen
Militaerstrategen als so gefaehrlich angesehen.

Die militaerischen Handlungsmuster und die sich wiederholenden
Sprachmuster, die wir mit diesen militaerischen Handlungen assoziieren,
druecken die Haltungen und Werte dieses pragmatischen Rahmens aus.
Auf dem Hoehepunkt der schriftkulturellen Entwicklung verfolgte zum
Beispiel England eine stark strukturierte, fast schon ritualisierte
Art der Kriegsfuehrung.  Zu den Hauptklagen waehrend der amerikanischen
Revolution gehoerte, dass die Bewohner der Kolonien nicht nach den
Regeln kaempften, die das schriftkulturell gebildete Westeuropa die
vergangenen Jahrhunderte hindurch aufgestellt hatte.  Mit dem Umbruch,
der zu einem Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur hinfuehrte,
erschoepften sich diese Haltungen und Werte und mit ihnen die Sprache
und die Muster militaerischer Handlungen, es sei denn, sie wurden auf
andere Bereiche, insbesondere auf Politik und Sport, uebertragen.

Nachdem sich das Militaer als gesellschaftliche Institution etabliert
hatte, wurde es zu einem Selbstzweck und bestimmte die Regeln des
sozialen und politischen Lebens, statt sie von dort zu uebernehmen.
Nach den beiden Weltkriegen uebernahm das Militaer in vielen Laendern
unter verschiedenen politischen und ideologischen Vorwaenden die Macht.
Militaerdiktaturen oder vom Militaer gestuetzte Diktaturen, die die
gleichen Merkmale wie zentralistische Monarchien oder auch
Demokratien unter einer Praesidialverfassung aufwiesen, schossen
ueberall dort aus dem Boden, wo sich andere Regierungsformen als
ineffektiv erwiesen hatten.  In vielen Teilen der Erde, die sich noch
immer an wirtschaftlichen und politischen Modellen der Vergangenheit
orientieren, also zum Beispiel in Suedamerika, dem Nahen Osten und
Afrika, geschieht dies noch heute.


Vom schriftgebundenen zum schriftlosen Krieg

Der letzte unter dem Zeichen der Schriftkultur gefuehrte Krieg war
vermutlich der Zweite Weltkrieg. Die Tatsache, dass der letzte
Weltkrieg mit dem Abwurf der Atombombe beendet wurde, ist ein
weiterer Beleg dafuer, dass eine Skalenveraenderung in einem
Lebensbereich zwangslaeufig ihre Auswirkungen auf alle anderen
Lebensbereiche hat.  Die Millionen von Kriegsopfern (von denen die
meisten nach den Massstaeben der Schriftkultur erzogen worden waren)
laesst uns zoegern, in diesem Zusammenhang von Bildung und Schriftkultur
zu sprechen; das kann aber nicht darueber hinwegtaeuschen, dass die
systematische Grausamkeit und die Vernichtungskraft des Krieges aus
Merkmalen der Schriftkultur resultierten, die die Effizienz der
Kriegsmaschinerie und die Ausformulierung der Kriegsziele ermoeglicht.
In der Geschichte des Zweiten Weltkriegs ist das Kapitel ueber die
Sprache vermutlich genauso aufschlussreich wie ein Kapitel ueber die
neuen Waffen, die in diesem Krieg entwickelt wurden: die Vorlaeufer
der modernen Raketensysteme und die Atombombe.  Alle Kriegsteilnehmer
wussten, dass der Feind ohne die integrierende Kraft der
schriftkulturellen Leistung nicht siegen konnte.  Viele Buecher sind
darueber geschrieben worden, wie die Sprache der politischen und
ideologischen Diskurse die Feindseligkeit eskalieren lassen.  Viele
der in diesem Krieg artikulierten Vorurteile wurden in Sprachwerken
von hoechstem sprachlichen Niveau formuliert und von perfekten,
logischen Argumenten getragen.  Andere Verfasser hoben indes auch die
Schwaechen der Schriftkultur hervor.  Roland Barthes zum Beispiel
untersuchte ihre faschistische Natur.  Andere fuehrten die
Unangemessenheit dieses Mediums auf dessen mangelnde Klarheit zurueck;
es sei so opak, dass es Gedanken verberge, statt sie aufzudecken, dass
sie falschen Werten einen Sinn verleihe, statt sie als das
hinzustellen, was sie de facto waren.

Und tatsaechlich wurde die Sprache der Politik die Sprache des Krieges.
UEber Radio, Zeitungen und Massenkundgebungen erreichte sie ganze
Nationen.  Die Industrie, auf der die Kriegsmaschinerie ruhte,
verkoerperte in allem die Merkmale der schriftkulturellen Lebenspraxis.
Das industrielle Modell intensiver Produktion laesst sich an diesem
Fall gut ablesen.  Millionen Menschen mussten an zahlreichen Fronten
bewegt, ernaehrt und logistisch gefuehrt werden.  Eine Wirtschaft in
der Krise, die alles andere als UEberfluss bot, gehoerte zu den
Antriebskraeften dieses Krieges.  Deutschland und seine Alliierten
hatten auf einen Blitzkrieg gesetzt und alle begrenzten Ressourcen
auf die Vorbereitung und Durchfuehrung dieses Krieges aufgewendet.
Europa war gerade dabei, sich von der Wirtschaftskrise in der Folge
des Ersten Weltkrieges zu erholen.  Mit dem Sieg versprach man den
Menschen den wohlverdienten Lohn.  Die Schriftkultur wurde in allen
Bereichen, in denen sie etwas bewirken konnte, mobilisiert: in
Bildung, Propaganda, religioeser und nationaler Indoktrination, in den
rassistischen Rechtfertigungsdiskursen und in der Formulierung der
Kriegsziele.  Sie richtete sich an die Soldaten an der Front und an
ihre Familien in der Heimat.  Sie unterstuetzte Selbstdisziplin und
Entsagung, foerderte Zentralismus und Hierarchie und lange, intensive
Arbeitszeiten bei relativ stabilen, wenn auch nicht unbedingt fairen
Arbeitsbeziehungen.

Sehr fortgeschrittene Formen der Arbeitsteilung und eine verbesserte
Koordination aller beteiligten Gruppen, also alle Merkmale
industrieller Produktionsweise, kennzeichneten auch die militaerische
Praxis.  Der Krieg fuehrte zu Konfrontationen zwischen riesigen Armeen,
die auf allen Seiten praktisch die gesamte Zivilbevoelkerung mit
einbezogen.  Es gab Aushungerungsstrategien (Blockaden,
Getreidevernichtung, die Unterbrechung lebensnotwendiger Taetigkeiten),
und es gab die totale Vernichtung.  Millionen von Menschen wurden
ausgeloescht.  In der Struktur der Armee spiegelte sich die
zugrundeliegende Struktur des pragmatischen Rahmens.  In ihrer
Funktionsweise spiegelte sich das Industriesystem, das darauf
zugeschnitten war, riesige Mengen an Rohstoffen zu verarbeiten, um
uniforme Produkte in Massenproduktion herzustellen.

Das, was die Schriftsprache der Schriftkultur zum entscheidenden
Faktor fuer die Arbeit und die Marktablaeufe werden liess, machte sie
auch in den fuer die militaerischen Ziele angemessenen Formen fuer die
Kriegsfuehrung unentbehrlich.  Deshalb wurden auch alle nur denkbaren
Anstrengungen unternommen, diese Sprache als Leistungstraeger der
eigenen Bemuehungen und als Sprache des Feindes zu verstehen.  Keine
Anstrengung wurde unterlassen, um so schnell wie moeglich an die
sprachlich codierten Informationen ueber Taktik und Strategie
heranzukommen und um dieses sprachliche Wissen umgehend in
Gegenstrategien und UEberraschungsangriffe umzusetzen.  Sprache wurde
zu einem entscheidenden Operationsbereich.  Man entschluesselte die
Codes des Feindes und sparte nicht an Geld, Intelligenz oder
Menschenleben, wenn es darum ging, die gegnerischen Plaene zu
entschluesseln.  Die kluegsten Koepfe wurden herangezogen, um
Taeuschungsstrategien zu entwickeln und umzusetzen: die Sprache des
Feindes war der direkte Zugang zu dessen Gedanken.

Natuerlich ist die Sprache des Krieges etwas anderes als die Sprache
unseres Alltags; aber sie hat doch ihren Ursprung in der
Alltagssprache und wird in ihr ausgedrueckt.  Strukturell sind beide
Sprachen gleich.  Mit dem Zugang zur Sprache des Feindes habe ich
einen Zugang zu seinen Plaenen.  Viele sind davon ueberzeugt, dass der
entscheidende Schlag im Zweiten Weltkrieg die Entschluesselung des
Codes der deutschen Enigma-Maschinen war; somit waere bei allen
Anstrengungen von Millionen Menschen die Sprache zum entscheidenden
Faktor des Krieges geworden.  Polnischen Geheimschriftanalytikern und
dem Britischen Geheimdienst mit Alan Turing (der Vater des modernen
computergestuetzten Rechnens) gelang es, Nachrichten zu entziffern, zu
rekonstruieren, zu uebersetzen und sie neu verschluesselt in alliierten
Codes (das sogenannte ULTRA-Material) als entscheidende taktische
Waffen zu verwenden.

Gegen Ende des Krieges hatte sich die Welt bereits nachhaltig
veraendert.  Im Rahmen des Krieges und im direkten Zusammenhang mit
den Veraenderungen in den Formen der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung
hatte ein Strukturwandel eingesetzt, der eine veraenderte Lebens- und
Arbeitsdynamik mit sich brachte.  Verschiedene Lebensaspekte, die den
Krieg letztendlich verursacht hatten, wurden durch die neuen
lebenspraktischen Umstaende in Frage gestellt und durch neue
Beduerfnisse ersetzt: dazu gehoerte insbesondere die Einsicht,
nationale Interessen zu ueberwinden und Grenzen zu ueberschreiten,
besonders die im Krieg zum Ausdruck gebrachten Grenzen von Hass und
Zerstoerung; die Einsicht in die Notwendigkeit, Ressourcen zu teilen
und auszutauschen.  Sehr weit vorausschauende Beobachter erkannten
auch, dass trotz der Opfer, die der Krieg gefordert hatte, das
Bevoelkerungswachstum rasant ansteigen und eine neue Skala der
Lebenspraxis erfordern wuerde, die sich in einem fest strukturierten,
unflexiblen System mit nur wenigen Freiheiten kaum wuerde entfalten
koennen.

Der Golfkrieg und die nicht enden wollenden weltweiten
Terroranschlaege koennen rueckblickend als Produkt eines Krieges
verstanden werden, der der Schriftkultur ein Ende bereitet hat.  Der
Blitzkrieg und der Abwurf der Atombombe ueber Hiroshima und Nagasaki
boten nur einen Vorgeschmack auf den schnellen, effizienten
schriftlosen Krieg, zu dessen juengsten Entwicklungen ausgekluegelte
genetische Texte und eine Nanotechnologie gehoeren, die dem Laien als
ein bluehendes Produkt aus Science-fiction-Romanen erscheint.


Der Nintendo-Krieg

UEberall auf der Welt verfuegt das Militaer ueber die modernste
Technologie.  Selbst Laender, die sich aufgrund ihrer
Bevoelkerungsdichte, der relativ niedrigen Loehne und der bestehenden
allgemeinen Wehrpflicht eine unzeitgemaess grosse Armee leisten koennen,
bemuehen sich unverhohlen um das Beste und Neueste, was Wissenschaft
und Technologie an Waffen zu bieten haben.  Der Ruestungsmarkt ist
vermutlich der allumfassendste aller Maerkte.  Am beunruhigendsten ist
dabei sicherlich, dass sich der menschliche Geist zum Handlanger von
Tod und Zerstoerung macht.  In manchen Laendern reichen die
Nahrungssmittelvorraete gerade fuer ein oder zwei Erntezyklen, waehrend
das Militaer mit Vorraeten fuer einen jahrelangen Einsatz ausgestattet
ist.

Heute verfuegt das Militaer ueber die ausgekluegeltsten Technologien, die
je entwikkelt wurden.  Gleichzeitig beklagt die OEffentlichkeit den
geringen Bildungsstand der Truppen.  Das gilt wohl weniger fuer die
Befehlsebene als fuer die eingezogenen jungen Soldaten.  Armeen
unterweisen die Rekrutierten im Umgang mit Waffen, von denen die
meisten fuer Schriftunkundige entwickelt wurden, und im Lesen und
Schreiben.  Letzteres festigt wohldosiert Ideologie, Religion,
Geschichte, Geographie, Psychologie und Sexualverhalten.  Die
Situation ist paradox: Die heutigen militaerischen
Anforderungsprofile--moderne Technologie, Aufgabenverteilung,
Netzwerke und verteilte Verantwortung--stehen im Konflikt mit den
traditionellen militaerischen Tugenden--klare Befehlsstruktur,
Hierarchie, Autoritaet und Disziplin.  Die technologischen Mittel, die
die Schriftkultur ueberfluessig machen, sind offenbar willkommen, aber
ihre Auswirkungen auf die Beschaffenheit des Menschen erscheinen
besorgniserregend.

Ein schriftgebildeter Soldat kann natuerlich besser indoktriniert und
den Regeln und Zwaengen unterworfen werden.  Aber das Gesicht des
Krieges hat sich veraendert: fuer die schnellen Ablaeufe ist das
Lesen--von Anweisungen, Befehlen, Botschaften--unzureichend, ja sogar
gefaehrlich.  Um Ziele anzuvisieren, die sich mit enormer
Geschwindigkeit naehern, benoetigt man die Mittlerdienste des digitalen
Auges.  Konflikte sind heute so segmentiert wie die Welt insgesamt,
erkennbare Grenzen zwischen Gut und Boese bestehen nicht mehr.
Angesichts der komplexen Dynamik heutiger Konflikte ist eine
zentralistisch organisierte militaerische Praxis mit Autoritaets- und
Hierarchiestrukturen kontraproduktiv.

Der Vietnamkrieg ist hierfuer ein dienliches Beispiel.  Befehle wurden
von oben an die Truppen weitergegeben, ueber Truppenfuehrer, die fuer
die Kriegsfuehrung in Vietnam nicht ausgebildet waren.  Sogar der
Praesident der Vereinigten Staaten schaltete sich ein, allzu oft mit
Entscheidungen, die den Kriegsverlauf negativ beeinflussten.  Die USA
vergassen die Lehren ihrer eigenen Geschichte, indem sie die in der
Schriftkultur entwickelte europaeische Kriegsfuehrung fuer den
illiteraten Dschungelkrieg uebernahmen.  Spaeter veroeffentlichte
Memoiren (etwas die von Robert MacNamara) decken auf, wie das in
Regierung und Militaer verkoerperte schriftkulturelle Paradigma der
OEffentlichkeit wichtige Informationen vorenthielt, die rueckblickend
den Verlust so vieler Menschenleben sinnlos machen.

Der Luxus einer grossen Armee und die Kosten fuer lange militaerische
Ausbildungszeiten gehoeren einer ueberholten Lebenspraxis an.  Ein
Soldat auf Lebenszeit ist ein Anachronismus.  Die Kriegswirklichkeit
veraendert sich mit der Geschwindigkeit, in der neue Waffensysteme
entwickelt werden.  Die neue Skala des Menschen verlangt nach
globaler Effizienz, die wir nicht erreichen, wenn wir produktive
Kraefte von produktiven Erfahrungen fernhalten.  Vor dem war das
Militaer eine von der Gesellschaft abgetrennte Institution.  Unser
neues Entwicklungsstadium hat das Militaer wieder in das Netz von
gemeinsamen Aufgaben und Funktionen innerhalb einer hocheffizienten
Lebenspraxis eingebunden.  Zwischen dem mittelalterlichen Krieger in
voller Ruestung und dem heutigen Soldaten in Alltagskleidung--der oft
eine wissenschaftliche oder technische Ausbildung hinter sich
hat--liegen nicht nur mehr als 500 Jahre, sondern vor allem neue
Formen der Selbstkonstituierung und Identitaetsfindung.  Zwischen dem
Schwefeldampf, der vor zweitausend Jahren in der Schlacht von Delium
eingesetzt wurde, und der Bedrohung durch chemische und biologische
Waffen im Golfkrieg besteht ein oberflaechlicher Zusammenhang.  Das
Wissen, das in die Herstellung neuer chemischer und biologischer
Verfahren fuer eine hocheffiziente Landwirtschaft und fuer
Lebensmittelbearbeitung eingeht, dient auch bei der Herstellung
chemischer und biologischer Massenvernichtungswaffen.  Die Gentechnik
und aeusserst komplexe digitale Mittel und Methoden definieren die
Grenzen unserer Moeglichkeiten neu.

Das ist weder eine Befuerwortung effizienter Armeen, die wir bei
Naturkatastrophen dringend benoetigen, noch eine Apologie von
Vernichtungskriegen, was und wer auch immer sie rechtfertigen mag.
Wenn es dennoch so klingt, dann liegt das daran, dass die schriftliche
Beschreibung des strukturellen Hintergrunds, vor dem sich die
militaerische Praxis abspielt, den Stempel schriftkultureller Praxis
traegt.  Das Militaer hat mittlerweile erkannt, dass es unsinnig waere,
schriftkulturelle Bildung als Koordinierungsmittel fuer militaerische
Aufgaben wiederzubeleben.  Denn sie ist kaum geeignet, im
Zusammenhang der hochentwickelten Ruestungstechnologie optimale
Leistungen zu erzielen.  Auch eignet sie sich kaum dazu, Kriege zu
verhindern.  Der in der Schriftkultur gebildete Mensch erwies sich
als ebensolche Kriegsbestie wie der zwangsweise eingezogene Soldat
oder der Soeldner, wenn er diese nicht sogar an Bestialitaet uebertraf.
Die fast 2 Millionen Kinder, alle Analphabeten, die als Soeldner in
Asien oder Afrika dienen, sind Teil der gleichen Realitaet, die ich
hier beschreibe.

Die heutige Ruestungsforschung versucht, den Menschen aus der direkten
kriegerischen Konfrontation heraus zu halten.  Nichts beeinflusst die
oeffentliche Meinung bei militaerischen Einsaetzen mehr als Leichensaecke.
Sie verderben den Spass am Spiel mit teuren Raketen, der auch der
Grund dafuer war, dass man den Golfkrieg "Nintendo-Krieg" genannt hat.
Raketen erfreuen sich bei den Netoyens trotz ihrer Zurueckhaltung
gegenueber militaerischen Einsaetzen groesserer Beliebtheit.
Hocheffiziente, digital programmierte Systeme haben einen anderen
Bezug zu Raum und Zeit als die Menschen.  Das verleiht den digitalen
Kriegsmaschinen und genetischen Waffen einen besonderen Vorteil
bezueglich der notwendigen Koordination.  Die Zeit ist auf eine Weise
segmentiert, die sich der menschlichen Wahrnehmung und Kontrolle
entzieht; der Raum erweitert sich zu Dimensionen jenseits der
menschlichen Vorstellung und Kontrolle.  Wesentliche Teile der
Kriegsmaschinerie operieren im All mit aeusserst zeitempfindlichen
Geraeten.  Die Strategic Defense Initiative (S.D.I., Star wars
genannt) ist das bekannteste, obwohl inzwischen schon wieder
vergessene, Beispiel.  Relativ triviale Systeme, wie sie zur
Orientierung der Truppen in der Wueste dienten, sind dabei schon
Routine.  Die Ausdruckskraft, die wir aufwenden muessen, um
Motivationen zu steigern und der Irrationalitaet einen Anschein von
Rationalitaet zu verleihen, steht im krassen Gegensatz zu der
Geschwindigkeit und Praezision, die zur Umsetzung der taktischen und
strategischen Plaene entscheidend sind.  Die Koordination solcher
Informationssystem-Maschinen kann nicht auf eine Sprache
zurueckgreifen, die fuer diese dynamischen Ablaeufe weder praezise noch
schnell genug ist.  Bei der UEberschallgeschwindigkeit von Flugzeugen,
Raketen und Satelliten wuerde ein Soldat, wenn er ein Ziel ortet, fuer
das Ausloesen einer Waffe keine Zeit mehr haben--vom Warten auf einen
Feuerbefehl ganz zu schweigen.

Selbst die Wartung dieser komplexen Kriegsmaschinerie kann mit
Mitteln der Schrift nicht mehr geleistet werden.  Das elektronische
Buch gehoert daher im militaerischen Bereich zum Alltag.  Dieses Buch
speichert die Beschreibung eines Geraetes digital.  Wenn wir den
Inhalt eines solchen fuer Flugzeuge oder Waffensysteme an Flugzeugen
und Schiffen funktionswichtigen Buches in einem konventionellen
gedruckten Handbuch unterbringen wollten, wuerde das blosse Gewicht der
Bedienungsanleitung das Flugzeug startunfaehig machen.  Jede
Veraenderung im System wuerde den Neudruck Tausender von Seiten
erfordern.  Als elektronische Version ist das Buch eine Sammlung von
computerbearbeiteten Daten, die auf Wunsch visualisiert werden und so
programmiert sind, dass man jedes Problem und die dazugehoerige Loesung
schnell und einfach ab-sehen kann--also gewissermassen idiotensicher.
Dieses Buch hat keine Seiten im ueblichen Sinn; es erstellt jede Seite
je nach konkretem Wartungs- oder Reparaturbedarf.  Das elektronische
Buch wendet sich an eine andere Leserschaft.  Sie besteht aus
visuellen Lesern, die wissen, wie man bildliche Anweisungen ausfuehrt.
Dabei werden sie vom System ueberwacht und verlassen sich auf dessen
Feedback.  Das Paradigma sich selbst bedienender und reparierender
Maschinen (eine von John von Neumann entwickelte Idee) ist laengst
Wirklichkeit geworden.

Das elektronische Buch--das weit ueber den militaerischen
Anwendungsbereich hinausgeht--ist eines von vielen Beispielen dafuer,
wie veraltet unsere gute alte Schriftkultur ist.  UEber
(drahtgebundene oder drahtlose) Netze aufgebaute elektronische Buecher
unterstuetzen eine Vielfalt kooperativer Unternehmungen.  Die
militaerische Praxis macht sich solche Aktivitaeten zunutze.
Entscheidend fuer derartige Kooperation ist der Zugang zu Ressourcen
und zu einer unbegrenzten Zahl moeglicher Interaktionen.  Die in den
elektronischen Buechern verwendeten Digitalformate dienen als Medium
fuer die UEbermittlung und das Verstehen von gemeinsamen Zielen.

Die vermutlich einzige militaerspezifische Komponente, die aus der
frueheren militaerischen Praxis uebernommen wurde, ist die Unterordnung
des Individuums unter das militaerische Ziel.  Aber auch diese
Unterordnung folgt nicht mehr dem zentralistischen und hierarchischen
Modell der Schriftkultur.  Von jedem einzelnen Soldaten wird heute
eine staerkere Eigeninitiative verlangt.  Dieses Ansinnen drueckt sich
vornehmlich in den verschiedenen Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsmitteln
aus.

Die heutige Technologie macht es moeglich, mit grosser Geschwindigkeit
auf niedriger Hoehe zu fliegen, aber die dem Menschen gesetzten
biologischen Grenzen lassen dies fuer den Piloten zu einer grossen
Gefahr werden.  Ab einer gewissen Geschwindigkeit kann der Mensch
seine Bewegungen nicht mehr koordinieren, was das Fliegen auf
niedriger Hoehe zu einer selbstmoerderischen Angelegenheit macht.  Aber
auch Selbstmord ist keine Antwort auf Radargeraete des Feindes, denn
es gibt keine Worte, die den Piloten auf einen von Hitzedetektoren
geleiteten Flugkoerper aufmerksam machen koennten.  Folglich veraendern
die vielen Sprachen, die die Maschinen lenken, und Sichtvorrichtungen
mit Detektionsfaehigkeiten die menschliche Beteiligung bei
kriegerischen Einsaetzen.  Fuer diese Sprachen spielt die
Schriftsprache eine voellig untergeordnete Rolle.

Ich fuehre diese Beispiele--die im Vergleich zum Nintendo-Krieg, den
wir vor einigen Jahren auf unseren Fernsehgeraeten verfolgen konnten,
rudimentaer sind--als jemand an, der an das Leben, den Frieden und an
die Verstaendigung zwischen den Menschen glaubt; aber auch als jemand,
der beobachtet, wie sich in einem der sprachabhaengigsten Bereiche
menschlicher Interaktion und Taetigkeit Sprache, Schrift und
schriftkulturelle Bildung zunehmend eruebrigen.  Wie alles, was sich
von Schrift und Schriftkultur loeste, wurde auch die militaerische
Praxis entmenschlicht.  Fuer den militaerischen Bereich ist diese
Konsequenz sehr begruessenswert.  Wir lassen Maschinen gegen Maschinen
kaempfen und sich gegenseitig toeten.  Wir machen aus dem Krieg einen
Krieg der Gene und der Genmanipulation, der neuronalen Netze und der
maschinellen Intelligenz, des intelligenten Datenbank-Managements und
vernetzter, verteilter Aufgaben.  Wie bereits in den Fabriken und den
Bueros wird der Mensch in der militaerischen Praxis von Programmen
ersetzt, die durch ein Wissen betrieben werden, das nicht durch
Schrift und Schriftkultur vermittelt wird.  Die neuen Sprachen der
Ruestungstechnologie veraendern die Struktur militaerischer Taetigkeit
und die Rolle, die die Sprache dabei spielt.  Dass Computerspiele mit
Flug- und Kampfsimulationen im Grunde nichts anderes sind als die
Praezisions- und Zerstoerungssysteme des Golfkriegs, brauchen wir hier
nicht noch einmal zu wiederholen.  Aber dass diejenigen, die solche
Spiele spielen, sich Faehigkeiten aneignen, die wir von Jet-Piloten
und den Betreibern dieser aeusserst produktiven Technologie erwarten,
verdient Beachtung und sollte uns nachdenklich stimmen.

Koennen Waffen sprechen, schreiben und lesen?  Verstehen sie die
Sprache des Offiziers, der entscheidet, wann sie abgefeuert werden
sollen?  Kann ein intelligentes Waffensystem kompetent darueber
entscheiden, ob ein Ziel tatsaechlich vernichtet werden soll, obwohl
die gegebenen Umstaende eine Zerstoerung aus moralischen Gruenden
verbieten wuerden?  Koennen genetische Methoden der Feindvernichtung
ethischen Kriterien standhalten?  Ich stelle diese Fragen--die alle
nur mit einem Nein beantwortet werden koennen--mit Bedacht.  In ihrer
schriftkulturellen Auspraegung beruht die militaerische Praxis auf
Befehl und Gehorsam, wofuer wir die Sprache benoetigen.  Das stellt uns
vor einen unloesbaren Widerspruch.  Die nicht-militaerische Praxis wird
zunehmend von vielen Spezialsprachen vermittelt und in einem
umfassenden Netz verteilter Aufgaben synchronisiert.  Wenn die
militaerische Praxis weiterhin auf der Schriftlichkeit beruhen wuerde,
hiesse das, unterschiedliche Strukturen der Lebenspraxis zu pflegen
und Ziele mit ungleicher Effizienz zu verfolgen.  Noch immer spiegeln
sich schriftkulturelle Prinzipien in den hierarchischen und
zentralistischen Strukturen des Militaers wider (in den Vereinigten
Staaten ist wie in vielen anderen Laendern der Praesident der
Oberbefehlshaber der Armee).  Andererseits erfordert die
Effizienzerwartung nicht-hierarchische Strukturen mit eigener
Kompetenz, die die Koordination und Kooperation innerhalb eines
grossen Netzes mit verschiedenen Aufgaben garantiert.  Die partielle
Schriftlichkeit des Militaers formuliert heute die neuen militaerischen
Ziele und Aufgaben, wie zum Beispiel die Umsiedlung von Fluechtlingen
oder die Unterstuetzung von Opfern einer Naturkatastrophe.  Die
kleineren, guerillaartigen Kriege, mit denen der internationale
Terrorismus seine Ziele durchsetzen will, haben zu kleinen Armeen mit
hervorragend ausgebildeten Spezialisten gefuehrt, die die
Zivilbevoelkerung schuetzen.  Terroristische Anschlaege sind ein
globales Phaenomen, aber im Gegensatz zu den kleinen Kriegen des
Mittelalters respektiert der ‘analphabete’ Terrorist oder das
bewaffnete Kind, das zum Kampf gezwungen ist, keine Regeln und
erkennt keine uebergeordnete Autoritaet an.


Blicke, die toeten koennen

Kleiner, besser einsetzbar, so effizient wie moeglich--das sind die
Merkmale der neuen Waffen, die auf der Wunschliste fast jeder Armee
der Welt stehen.  Die Verteidigungsexperten haben die Forschungs- und
Entwicklungsziele spezifischer formuliert.  Im folgenden sind einige
davon, die allesamt bald veraltet sein werden, aufgefuehrt:
* Weltweit und unter allen Wetterbedingungen einsetzbare Kraefte fuer
begrenzte Kriegsfuehrung, die keinen Hauptstuetzpunkt benoetigen;
einschliesslich einer Einheit, die 30 Tage lang logistisch unabhaengig
ist;
* Das Aufspueren von strategisch beweglichen Zielen;
* Globale Befehlskontrolle, Kommunikation und Aufklaerungsausruestung
(C3I), fuer die UEberwachung ausgewaehlter Territorien und
Informationsuebermittlung in Echt-Zeit an Befehlsstellen;
* Waffensysteme, die der Feind nicht anvisieren kann und die die
feindlichen Abwehrmassnahmen durch Einsatz von digitalen Signaturen
und elektronischen Systemen ueberwinden;
* UEberlegene Luftverteidigungssysteme;
* Waffen, die ihre Ziele selbstaendig erfassen, klassifizieren,
verfolgen und zerstoeren;
* Reduzierung der Operations- und Nachschubressourcen um 50%, ohne
die Einsatzfaehigkeit zu beeintraechtigen.
Alles, was man dazu sagen kann, ist, dass in dieser militaerischer
Effizienz alle Merkmale der Zivilisation jenseits der Schriftkultur
zum Ausdruck kommen: Globalitaet, Vernetzung, offene Ziele und
Motivationen, verminderte menschliche Beteiligung und viele partielle
Sondersprachen.  Der fragwuerdige Aspekt dabei ist die Dauerhaftigkeit
der Institution des Militaers, die vermutlich das widerstandsfaehigste
Vermaechtnis der Schriftkultur ist.  Die Technologie jenseits der
Schriftkultur verlangt, dass wir die Abstraktionen (die Sprache, den
genetischen Code) beherrschen, die sie vorantreiben, ebenso wie die
mit dieser Sprache verbundenen partiellen Spezialbildungen, die der
militaerischen wie jeder anderen Praxis zugehoert.  Die partielle
Spezialbildung der militaerischen Praxis bestimmt ihren
Handlungsspielraum und die Interpretation ihrer Handlungen.  Daher
ist es zum Beispiel auch wichtig, dass Abruestungsvertraege nicht ohne
diese militaerische Spezialsprache, d. h. ohne Militaerexperten, die
wir mit diesen Vertraegen aus ihren Aufgaben entlassen wollen,
formuliert werden.  Ein jeder dieser Vertraege fuehrt dazu, dass ein
Teil dieser Ruestungssprache und der damit verbundenen Technologien
ausrangiert wird oder doch zumindest an Bedeutung verliert; wie ein
jeder Vertrag natuerlich auch neue Wege fuer erhoehte militaerische
Effizienz eroeffnet.

In der neuen militaerischen Praxis geraten Technologien und die damit
verbundenen militaerischen Spezialsprachen in eine Konfrontation.
Wenn wir also heute darueber nachdenken, welche Befehle ein Offizier
erteilt, ob eine Waffe diese Befehle versteht usw., dann bedeutet das,
dass wir das Militaer aus einem Blickwinkel betrachten, der aus jener
Zivilisationsphase stammt, von der das Militaer sich zunehmend absetzt.
Kuenstliche Augen (Radar, Sichtsysteme), Geruchsdetektoren,
beruehrungsempfindliche Vorrichtungen, Geschwindigkeitssensoren und
viele andere digitale Instrumente entziehen den Menschen der direkten
kriegerischen Konfrontation und eliminieren den Tod als mathematische
Groesse in der Formel des Krieges.  Wer Photos aus vorangegangenen
Kriegen neben die Trickbilder von Computerspielen haelt, vergleicht
eine Daseinsform, die durch direkte Konfrontation und durch die
Erfahrung begrenzter Lebensbedingungen gekennzeichnet ist, mit einer
Daseinsform, die aus vermittelten Wirklichkeitserfahrungen besteht.
Der von Leuchtspurgeschossen aufgehellte Himmel, die unheimlichen, an
Videospiele erinnernden Vorgaenger, die durch entfernt plazierte
Kameras beobachteten Ziele scheinen einem ganz anderen Bereich als
dem der Zerstoerung und des Blutvergiessens anzugehoeren, wo es noch
moralische Bedenken gegeben hat.  Die Erwartung ist pragmatisch, der
Massstab ist die Effizienz.

Die Gruende fuer das UEberleben der Institution des Militaers in ihrer
schriftkulturellen Struktur und der Mangel an Verstaendnis dafuer, was
Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur im pragmatischen Rahmen der
heutigen Globalitaet ueberfluessig machten, sind nicht identisch.
Ersteres erklaert sich aus der immensen Traegheit eines riesigen
Apparates; letzteres daraus, dass wir uns als Produkte einer auf
Schriftkultur gruendenden Erziehung und Bildung nicht so ohne weiteres
von uns selbst distanzieren koennen.  Einen derart fundamentalen
Umbruch zu verstehen und zu akzeptieren, ist nicht leicht.
Universitaeten, Bastionen der Schriftkultur, die die ‘illiterate’
Ruestungstechnologie entwickeln, befinden sich in dem Dilemma,
entweder ihre Identitaet zu verleugnen oder Agenzien einer
Zivilisation jenseits der Schriftkultur zu werden.  Sie halten
unverbruechlich am Ideal der Schriftkultur und damit auch an dem der
Verteidigung und Abschrekkung fest, die ja ihrerseits den
schriftkulturellen Wert der Nationalgrenze widerspiegelt; denn wir
haben noch nicht gelernt, mit einer Dynamik des Umbruchs umzugehen,
die sich nicht aus militaerischen, sondern aus soziooekonomischen
Beduerfnissen ergibt.  Die politische Landkarte hat sich in den
vergangenen Jahren drastisch veraendert.  Die Gruende hierfuer sind in
jenen Faktoren zu sehen, die den pragmatischen Kontext unserer
Lebenspraxis im Rahmen der heute erreichten Skala veraendert haben.
Globalitaet ist kein Traum, kein politisches Ziel, kein utopisches
Projekt mehr.  Globalitaet ist eine aus dieser neuen Skala erwachsende
Notwendigkeit.
