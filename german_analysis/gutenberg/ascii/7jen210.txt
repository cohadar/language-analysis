Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of November, 2001, contributions are being solicited from people

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer 
to
donate.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm 
etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States 
copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

Vorwort zur deutschen Ausgabe

Unsere Welt ist in Unordnung geraten.  Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist eine
grosse Belastung fuer alle.  Sozialleistungen werden weiter drastisch
gekuerzt.  Das Universitaetssystem befindet sich im Umbruch.  Politik,
Wirtschaft und Arbeitswelt durchlaufen Veraenderungen, die sich nicht
nach dem gewohnten ordentlichen Muster des sogenannten Fortschritts
richten.  Gleichwohl verfolgen Politiker aller Couleur politische
Programme, die mit den eigentlichen Problemen und Herausforderungen
in Deutschland (und in Europa) nicht das Geringste zu tun haben.  Das
vorliegende Buch moechte sich diesen Herausforderungen widmen, aus
einer Perspektive, die die Zwangslaeufigkeit dieser Entwicklung betont.

Wenn man eine Hypothese vorstellt, benoetigt man ein geeignetes
Prueffeld.  In meinen Augen ist Deutschland am besten dafuer geeignet.
In keinem anderen Land der Welt laesst sich die Dramatik des Umbruchs
so unmittelbar verfolgen wie hier.  In Deutschland treffen die Kraefte
und Werte, die zu den grossen historischen Errungenschaften und den
katastrophalen historischen Fehlleistungen dieses Landes gefuehrt
haben, mit den neuen Kraeften und Werten, die das Gesicht der Welt
veraendern, gewissermassen in Reinform zusammen.

An Ordnung, Disziplin und Fortschritt gewoehnt, beklagen die Buerger
heute eine allgegenwaertige laehmende Buerokratie, die von Regierung und
Verwaltung ausgeht.  Frueher galt das, verbunden mit dem Namen
Bismarcks, als gute deutsche Tugend, eine der vielen
Qualitaetsmaschinen „Made in Germany“.  Im Verlauf der Zeit aber wurde
der Buerger abhaengig von ihr und konnte sich nicht vorstellen, jemals
ohne sie auszukommen.  Die Mehrheit schreckt vor Alternativen zurueck
und moechte nicht einmal ueber sie nachdenken.  Gepraegt von Technik und
Qualitaetsarbeit ist die Vorstellung, dass das Industriezeitalter
seinem Ende entgegengeht, den meisten eine Schreckensvision.  Sie
wuerden eher ihre Schrebergaerten hergeben als die digitale Autobahn zu
akzeptieren, die doch die Staus auf ihren richtigen Autobahnen zu den
Hauptverkehrszeiten abbauen koennte--ich betone das „koennte“.  Noch
immer lebt es sich gut durch den Export eines technischen und
wissenschaftlichen Know-how, dessen Glanzzeit allerdings vorueber ist.

Als ein hochzivilisiertes Land ist Deutschland fest entschlossen, den
barbarischen Teil seiner Vergangenheit hinter sich zu lassen.  Der
Klarheit halber sei gesagt, was ich unter barbarisch verstehe:
Hitler-Deutschland verdient keinen anderen Namen, ebensowenig wie
alle anderen AEusserungen von Aggression, Antisemitismus und Rassismus,
die noch immer nicht der Vergangenheit angehoeren.  Aber bis heute hat
man nicht verstanden, dass eben jene pragmatische Struktur, die die
industrielle Kraft Deutschlands begruendete, auch die destruktiven
Kraefte beguenstigte.  (Man denke nur an die Technologieexporte, die
die wahnsinnigen Fuehrer oelreicher Laender erst juengst in die Haende
bekommen haben.) Das wiedervereinigte Deutschland ist bereit, in
einer Welt mit globalen Aufgaben und globalen Problemen Verantwortung
zu uebernehmen.  Es setzt sich unter anderem fuer den Schutz des
tropischen Regenwaldes ein und zahlt fuer Werte--den Schutz der
Umwelt--statt fuer Produkte.  Aber die politischen Fuehrer Deutschlands
und mit ihnen grosse Teile der Bevoelkerung haben noch nicht begriffen,
dass der Osten des Landes nicht unbedingt ein Duplikat des Westens
werden muss, damit beide Teile zusammenpassen.  Differenz, d. h.
Andersartigkeit, ist eine Qualitaet, die sich in Deutschland keiner
grossen Wertschaetzung erfreut.  Verlorene Chancen sind der Preis, den
Deutschland fuer diese preussische Tugend der Gleichmacherei bezahlen
muss.

Die englische Originalfassung dieses Buches wurde 1997 auf der
Leipziger Buchmesse vorgestellt und in der Folge von der Kritik
wohlwollend aufgenommen.  Dank der grosszuegigen Unterstuetzung durch
die Mittelsten-Scheid Stiftung Wuppertal und die Alfred und Claere
Pott Stiftung Essen, fuer die ich an dieser Stelle noch einmal Dank
sage, konnte dann Anfang 1998 die Realisierung des von Beginn an
bestehenden Plans einer deutschsprachigen Ausgabe konkret ins Auge
gefasst werden.  Und nachdem Prof. Dr. Norbert Greiner, bei dem ich
mich hier ebenfalls herzlich bedanken moechte, fuer die UEbersetzung
gewonnen war, konnte zuegig an die Erarbeitung einer gegenueber der
englischen Ausgabe deutlich komprimierten und staerker auf den
deutschsprachigen Diskussionskontext zugeschnittenen deutschen
Ausgabe gegangen werden.  Einige Kapitel der Originalausgabe sind in
der deutschsprachigen Edition entfallen, andere wurden stark
ueberarbeitet.  Entfallen sind vor allem solche Kapitel, die sich in
ihren inhaltlichen Bezuegen einem deutschen Leser nicht unmittelbar
erschliessen wuerden.  Ein Nachwort, das sich ausschliesslich an die
deutschen Leser wendet, wurde ergaenzt.

Die deutsche Fassung ist also eigentlich ein anderes Buch.  Wer das
Thema erweitern und vertiefen moechte, ist selbstverstaendich
eingeladen, auf die englische Version zurueckzugreifen, in die 15
Jahre intensiver Forschung, Beobachtung und Erfahrung mit der neuen
Technologie und der amerikanischen Kultur eingegangen sind.  Ein
Vorzug der kompakten deutschen Version liegt darin, dass die juengsten
Entwicklungen--die so schnell vergessen sein werden wie alle anderen
Tagesthemen--„Fortsetzungen“ meiner Argumente darstellen und sie
gewissermassen kommentieren.  Sie haben wenig miteinander zu tun und
sind dennoch in den folgenden Kapiteln antizipiert: Guildos Auftritt
beim Grand Prix d’Eurovision (liebt er uns eigentlich immer noch, und
warum ist das so wichtig?), die enttaeuschende Leistung der deutschen
Nationalmannschaft bei der Fussballweltmeisterschaft (standen sich im
Endspiel Brasilien und Frankreich oder Nike und Adidas gegenueber?),
die Asienkrise, das Ergebnis der Bundestagswahlen, der Euro, neue
Entwicklungen in Wissenschaft und Technologie, die juengsten
Arbeitslosenzahlen, die OEkosteuer und vieles mehr.  Wer sich der Muehe
einer gruendlichen Lektuere des vorliegenden Buches unterzieht, wird
sich auf diese Entwicklungen einen eigenen Reim machen koennen, sehr
viel besser als die Mediengurus, die uns das Denken abnehmen wollen.
Zumindest wird er ueber die wortreichen Artikel halbgebildeter
Akademiker und opportunistischer Journalisten schmunzeln, die allzeit
bereit sind, anderen zu erklaeren, was sie selbst nicht verstehen.

Wie in der englischen Version moechte ich auch meine deutschen Leser
einladen, mit mir in Kontakt zu treten und mir ihre kritischen
Kommentare oder Fragen per e-mail zukommen zu lassen: nadin@acm.org.
Im Einklang mit dem Ziel des Buches, fuer die Kommunikation jenseits

Kapitel 1:

Von den Zeichen zur Sprache

Sprachen sind, ebenso wie die jeweiligen Schriftkulturen und die auf
ihnen gruendende Bildung, untereinander sehr verschieden.  Die
Unterschiede gehen weit ueber Wortklang, Alphabet, Buchstabenfolge und
Satzstrukturen hinaus.  Manche Sprachen weisen nuancierte
Unterscheidungen fuer Farben, Formen, Geschlechtsbezeichnungen,
Mengenbezeichnungen und Naturphaenomene auf, waehrend allgemeine
Aussagen nur schwer in ihnen zu formulieren sind.  Wir wissen aus der
Anthropologie, dass eine Sprache die jeweilige Lebenswelt ihres
eigenen Sprachraums lexikalisch differenzierter widerspiegelt als
andere Sprachen.  Die verschiedenen Bezeichnungen fuer Schnee in
Eskimosprachen oder fuer Kamel im Arabischen sind gelaeufige Beispiele.
Sprachen kategorisieren die Wirklichkeit.  Und eine Sprache
erscheint umso fremder, je fremder dem Betrachter die in ihr erfasste
Wirklichkeit ist.  So fuehrt auch die Beherrschung der chinesischen
Sprache (d. h. in ihr gebildet zu sein), zu etwas anderem als die
Beherrschung etwa des Englischen oder eines afrikanischen
Stammesdialekts.  Schon diese Beispiele zeigen, dass die praktische
Erfahrung, durch die eine Sprache hervorgebracht wird, Teil des
allgemeinen pragmatischen Handlungsraums des Menschen ist.

Eine abstrakte Sprache gibt es nicht.  Doch trotz der zum Teil
erheblichen Unterschiede zwischen den Sprachen ist die
Sprachfaehigkeit der gemeinsame Nenner der Spezies homo sapiens und
ein konstitutives Element der Dynamik dieser Spezies.  Wir sind
unsere Sprache.  Die Feststellung, dass die Sprache dem Leben folgt
und es nachbildet, trifft nur die halbe Wahrheit.  Denn zugleich
bildet sich auch in der Verwendung der Sprache das Leben heraus.
Beide beeinflussen sich gegenseitig, letztlich haengt der Mensch von
jenem pragmatischen Handlungszusammenhang ab, innerhalb dessen er
seine biologische Struktur in den praktischen Akt der
Selbstdefinition uebertraegt.

Die Gruende fuer Veraenderungen im dynamischen Zustand einer Sprache
koennen wir aus jenen (biologischen, sozialen, kulturellen) Bereichen
erschliessen, die Sprache hervorgebracht haben, die Unterschiede in
der Sprachverwendung hervorgerufen und die Anlaesse fuer Veraenderungen
der Lebensumstaende gegeben haben.  Die Notwendigkeit zur Veraenderung
und die Kraefte, die die Veraenderung tragen, duerfen dabei nicht
verwechselt werden, obwohl die Trennung zwischen ihnen nicht immer
ganz leicht ist.  Veraenderte Arbeitsgewohnheiten und Lebensformen
sind ebenso wie die Sprache, die sie ausdrueckt, an den pragmatischen
Rahmen unserer bestaendigen Selbstkonstituierung gebunden.  Noch immer
verfuegen wir ueber zehn Finger--eine Strukturgegebenheit des
menschlichen Koerpers, die sich in das Dezimalsystem uebertragen hat--,
aber das binaere Zahlensystem ist heute vermutlich vorherrschend.  Das
besagt nichts anderes, als dass neue Woerter immer dann gepraegt werden,
wenn die Umstaende dies erfordern, und der Vergessenheit anheimfallen,
wenn sie nicht laenger benoetigt werden.  Oft ermoeglichen neue Woerter
und neue Ausdrucksformen erst neue Lebens- und Arbeitsformen; sie
bilden dann nicht nur Leben ab, sondern oeffnen ihm moegliche
Entwicklungswege.

Die Sprache erlaubt dem Menschen erlernbare und kulturell tradierbare
Organisationsformen, die ihn vom instinktiven Verhalten des Tieres
unterscheiden.  UEber den Ursprung der Sprache ist damit noch nichts
gesagt, und nichts darueber, warum die instinktive und genetisch
vererbte Organisationsform der Tierwelt fuer die sprachlich
vermittelte Organisationsform des Menschen weder hinreicht noch
dieser gleichwertig ist.  Sprache ist mehr als ein blosser
Archivierungsort, sie ist ein Mittel zum Entwurf von Wirklichkeit,
ein Instrument zur Hervorbringung neuer Instrumente und deren
Evaluierung.

Doch wir muessen Sprache in einem noch allgemeineren Rahmen betrachten.
Sprachen entwickeln sich wie die Menschen, die sie benutzen.  Auch
das Aussterben von Sprachen gibt Aufschluss darueber, wie das Leben
einer Sprache an das Leben derer gebunden ist, die sie entwickelt und
erforderlich gemacht und schliesslich durch andere Mittel ersetzt
haben.  Die anthropologische, archaeologische und genetische Forschung,
die sich mit den vorsprachlichen Stadien menschlichen Lebens befasst,
konzentriert sich auf die Gegenstaende, die man fuer primitive
Verrichtungen verwendete.  Aus diesem Zusammenhang wissen wir recht
zuverlaessig, dass vor der Entwicklung relativ stabiler und repetitiver
Strukturen die Menschen Laute und koerpersprachliche Formen der Mimik
und Gestik einsetzten, und zwar wohl ziemlich genau so, wie wir es
heute von Kleinkindern kennen.  Aus den fruehen Stadien der Menschheit
ist ein reicher Fundus an Handlungsmustern und Verhaltenscodes
ueberliefert, die durchaus eine gewisse Kohaesion aufweisen.  Unsere
Vorfahren aus grauer Vorzeit entwickelten bereits fuer den Zweck der
Nahrungsversorgung und als Reaktion auf Veraenderungen in den
Lebensbedingungen, die sich auf die Ernaehrungs- und Schutzbeduerfnisse
auswirkten, bestimmte regelhafte Verhaltensformen.

In vorsprachlicher Zeit fungierten Werkzeuge offenbar auch als
Zeichen und Kommunikationsmittel.  Viele Wissenschaftler glauben
allerdings, dass die Erfindung von Werkzeugen ohne Woerter, also vor
der Existenz von Sprache, nicht moeglich war.  Ihnen zufolge sind die
zur Herstellung von Werkzeugen und die zur Herausbildung des
werkzeugmachenden Menschen (homo faber) erforderlichen kognitiven
Prozesse sprachlicher Natur.  Das Werkzeug als Verlaengerung des Arms
stelle eine Art von Verallgemeinerung dar, die nur durch Sprache
moeglich wurde.  Es koennte aber durchaus sein, dass natuerliche Formen
der "Notation" (Fussabdruecke, Bisseindruecke und solche Steingebilde,
die manche bereits fuer Werkzeuge halten) der Sprache vorausgingen.
Solche Notierungen duerfen auch als Extension der biologischen
Gegebenheiten des Menschen gelten und entsprechen einem kognitiven
Entwicklungsstand und einer Existenzskala, die auf die Herausbildung
von Sprache hinfuehrte.

Die vorliegenden Erkenntnisse ueber die Entstehung von Schriftsystemen
lassen nachvollziehen, wie sich lautliche und gestische Muster zu
graphischen Darstellungen entwickelt haben, und zugleich auch, wie
mit dem Entstehen der Schrift neue Erfahrungshorizonte und eine
breitere Skala menschlicher Taetigkeit erschlossen wurden.
Entsprechende Rueckschluesse koennen wir auch aus aussterbenden Sprachen
ziehen, die weniger wegen ihrer Grammatik oder Phonetik interessant
sind als wegen des erkennbaren Zusammenhangs, der zwischen ihnen und
einer entsprechenden Erfahrungswelt, einer zugrundeliegenden
biologischen Struktur und der Skala der menschlichen Erfahrungen und
ihrer Veraenderungen besteht.

Der hier getroffenen Unterscheidung zwischen vorsprachlicher Notation,
Sprachentstehung, Entstehung von Schriftsystemen und aussterbenden
Sprachen entspricht ein Unterschied zwischen Arten und Typen
menschlicher Ausdrucksweise, Interaktion und Interpretation von allem,
was die Menschen zur Anerkennung der sie umgebenden Wirklichkeit
heranziehen.  Auf sich oder andere aufmerksam zu machen erfordert
noch keine Sprache.  Hierfuer reichen Laute, Gesten koennen das Signal
verstaerken.  In jedem artikulierten Laut und in jeder Geste
projiziert sich der Mensch auf irgendeine Weise.  In Hoehe, Timbre,
Umfang und Dauer eines Lautes bleibt Individualitaet bewahrt; Gesten
koennen langsam oder schnell, zoegernd oder aggressiv oder in einer
Mischung von alldem ausgefuehrt werden.  Wird aber ein bestimmter Laut
oder eine Lautfolge bzw. eine bestimmte Geste oder Gestenfolge auf
die Bezeichnung eines bestimmten Gegenstandes festgelegt, so wird aus
diesem stabilisierten Ausdruck das, was wir im Nachhinein ein Zeichen
nennen.


Wiedersehen mit semeion

Das Interesse an menschlichen Zeichensystemen reicht bis weit in die
Antike zurueck.  Doch heute verzeichnen wir ein verstaerktes Interesse
an Fragen der Semiotik, jener Disziplin, die sich mit Zeichen
(griechisch semeion) beschaeftigt.  Der Grund hierfuer liegt in der
rasanten Zunahme von Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsformen, die nicht
mehr auf die Mittel der natuerlichen Sprache zurueckgreifen.  Auch die
Interaktion zwischen Menschen und immer komplexer werdenden Maschinen
hat semiotische Fragen ganz neuer Art aufgeworfen.

Die Sprache--in muendlicher und schriftlicher Form--ist wohl das
komplexeste Zeichensystem, das wir kennen.  Das Wort Sprache bezieht
sich zwar auch auf andere Zeichensysteme, stellt aber keineswegs eine
Synthese aller dieser Zeichensysteme dar.  Den Entwicklungsprozess der
Sprachlichkeit koennen wir als eine fortschreitende Projektion des
Individuums auf seine Lebensumwelt verstehen.  Das Zeichen Ich als
Bezeichnung der eigenen Individualitaet--die sich von anderen Ichs
unterscheidet, mit denen man kooperiert, konkurriert oder
kaempft--koennen wir wahrscheinlich als erstes Zeichen voraussetzen.
Es bestand zusammen mit dem Zeichen fuer das andere; denn Ich kann nur
in Relation zu dem anderen definiert werden.  In einer als das andere
erfahrenen Welt zeichneten sich Einheiten ab, die entweder gefaehrlich
und bedrohlich, hilfreich oder kooperativ waren.  Solche
qualifizierenden Eigenschaften konnte man nicht einfach zum
Identifikationsmerkmal machen.  Sie stellten Projektionen des
Subjekts dar, das seine Umwelt erkannte, interpretierte oder
fehldeutete.

Um meine These von der pragmatischen Natur von Sprache und
Schriftlichkeit zu belegen, muss ich mich noch etwas naeher mit dem
vorsprachlichen Stadium befassen.  Mein Interesse beschraenkt sich
dabei auf die Natur der Sprache, was indes ihre Entstehung und die
Bedingungen dafuer mit einschliesst.  Auf das, was wir gemeinhin als
Werkzeug bezeichnen, und auf rudimentaere Verhaltenskodes (in Bezug
auf Sexualitaet, Schutzbeduerfnis und Nahrungssuche) habe ich bereits
hingewiesen.  Es gibt fuer dieses Stadium genuegend historisch
gesichertes Material und eine ganze Reihe bekannter Tatsachen
(Klimawechsel, das Aussterben von Tieren und Planzen), die sich auf
dieses Stadium ausgewirkt haben.  Schlussfolgerungen aus Lebensformen,
die denen aehneln, die wir fuer die fruehen menschlichen Lebensformen
halten, ergaenzen unser Wissen darueber, wie sich Zeichen als Ausdruck
einer Identitaet herausgebildet haben.  Diese Zeichen bilden eine
Objektwelt ab und druecken daneben eine Bewusstheit von einer Welt aus,
die durch die biologische Veranlagung des Menschen ermoeglicht wurde.

Allgemein wird Sprechen verstanden als Erklaerung von Gedanken mittels
Zeichen, die fuer diesen Zweck entwickelt wurden.  Gleichzeitig wird
das Denken als seiner Natur nach von Woertern und Zeichen unabhaengig
verstanden.  Meiner Meinung nach ist der UEbergang vom Natur- zum
Kulturzustand, d. h. von Reaktionen auf natuerliche Reize zu Reflexion
und Bewusstheit, durch Kontinuitaet und Diskontinuitaet gleichermassen
gekennzeichnet.  Die Kontinuitaet liegt in der biologischen Struktur,
die in den Interaktionsraum des Menschen mit aehnlichen oder
unaehnlichen Einheiten uebertragen wurde.  Die Diskontinuitaet ergibt
sich aus Veraenderungen in der Gehirngroesse, des aufrechten Gangs und
der Funktion der Haende.  Das vorsprachliche (praediskursive) Stadium
ist seiner Natur nach unmittelbar.  Das diskursive Stadium, das den
manifesten Gedanken ermoeglicht, ist durch Sprachzeichen vermittelt.

Die Zeichen, mit denen die Menschen des vorsprachlichen
Entwicklungsstadiums ihre Wirklichkeit in ihren Existenzrahmen
uebertrugen, drueckten durch die ihnen eigene Energie und Plastizitaet
das aus, was die Menschen damals waren.  Sie brachten vor allem das
zum Ausdruck, was im anderen--in anderen Gegenstaenden oder anderen
Lebewesen--als gleich erfahren wurde, und Gleichheit war allen
Zeichen gemein.  Direkte Interaktion und Unmittelbarkeit, Aktion und
Reaktion waren vorherrschend.  Das Unerwartete oder Verzoegerte war
das Unbekannte, Mysterioese.  Die Skala des menschlichen Lebens war
klein.  Jedes Geschehen, jeder Vollzug bestand aus wenigen Schritten
und war von begrenzter Dauer.  Zeichen der Gegenwaertigkeit, einer
allen gemeinsamen Raum- und Zeiterfahrung, wurden zum Ausdruck der
Interaktion.  Zeichen bezogen sich auf das Hier und Jetzt des
gemeinsam erfahrenen Lebens und drueckten auf unmittelbare Weise Dauer,
Naehe und Intervalle aus, lange bevor sich die heutigen Vorstellungen
von Raum und Zeit herausgebildet haben.  Mithilfe solcher
Unterscheidungen durch Zeichen konnte Abwesendes oder Bevorstehendes
angedeutet bzw. die Dynamik sich wiederholender Vorgaenge ausgedrueckt
werden.  Nach diesen fruehen Formen des Selbstausdrucks erst konnte
die Darstellungsfunktion von Zeichen entwickelt werden: ein hoher
Schrei, der nicht nur Schmerz ausdrueckte, sondern vor einer Gefahr
warnte, die Schmerz bewirken konnte; ein erhobener Arm, der ueber die
Bekundung von Praesenz hinaus Aufmerksamkeit forderte; Farbe auf der
Haut nicht nur als Ausdruck der Freude an einer Frucht oder Pflanze,
sondern als Ankuendigung und Antizipation bevorstehender aehnlicher
Freuden--kurz, Anweisungen, ja sogar Instruktionen, die man befolgen,
lernen und nachahmen konnte.

Als Teil des auf diese Weise zum Ausdruck Gebrachten entwarfen die
Individuen in der Verwendung des Ausdrucks nicht nur sich selbst,
sondern auch ihre auf diese begrenzte Welt bezogene Erfahrung.
Zeichen, die Bezuege zu Ereignissen herstellten (Wolken zu Regen,
Hufschlag zu Tieren, Blasen auf der Wasseroberflaeche fuer Fische),
stellten nicht nur diese Ereignisse dar, sondern drueckten
gleichzeitig die mit anderen gemeinsame Erfahrung in der Lebenswelt
aus.  Erfahrungsaustausch ueber das Hier und Jetzt hinaus, also der
UEbergang von direkter und unmittelbarer zu indirekter und
vermittelter Interaktion, bezeichnet den naechsten kognitiven
Entwicklungsschritt.  Er konnte vollzogen werden, als gemeinsam
verwendete Zeichen auf eine allen gemeinsame Erfahrung bezogen wurden
und sich daraus Regeln ergaben, nach denen neue Zeichen fuer neue
Erfahrungen erzeugt werden konnten.  Jedes Zeichen ist ein
biologisches Zeugnis ueber seinen eigenen Entstehungsprozess und ueber
die Skala der menschlichen Erfahrung.  Das Fluestern erreicht einen,
vielleicht zwei Zuhoerer, die nahe beieinander stehen.  Ein Schrei
entspricht einer anderen Skala.  Insofern birgt jedes Zeichen seine
eigene Geschichte in Kurzform und vollzieht den Brueckenschlag vom
Natur- zum Kulturzustand des Menschen.

Abfolgen, etwa die Aufeinanderfolge von Lauten oder sprachlichen
AEusserungen, oder Zeichenverknuepfungen wie in Bildern lassen eine
hoehere Stufe der kognitiven Entwicklung erkennen.  Die Beziehungen
zwischen solchen Abfolgen oder Verknuepfungen und der sie
hervorbringenden praktischen Erfahrung sind nicht mehr intuitiver Art.
Aus dem Verstaendnis solcher Zeichenbeziehungen praktische Regeln
abzuleiten, gehoerte zu den wesentlichen Interaktionserfahrungen der
Benutzer solcher Zeichensysteme.  An einem spaeteren Entwicklungspunkt
ist die unmittelbare Erfahrungskomponente nur noch indirekt in der
Sprache gegenwaertig.  Sprache ist nachgerade das Ergebnis dieser
Verlagerung der Aufmerksamkeit vom Zeichen zu den Beziehungen
zwischen Zeichen.  In ihrer primitivsten Form war Grammatik nicht ein
System von Regeln ueber die Zusammensetzung von Zeichen (Syntax) oder
darueber, wie Zeichen etwas bezeichnen (Semantik), sondern darueber,
wie bestimmte Umstaende neue Zeichen entstehen liessen, die ihre
Erfahrungsqualitaet beibehielten--also Pragmatik.

Sprache entwickelte sich folglich als eine Vermittlungsinstanz
zwischen stabilisierter Erfahrung (Wiederholungsmuster in Arbeits-
und Interaktionsablaeufen) und Zukunft (durchbrochene Muster).  Die
Zeichen bewahrten zunaechst die Konkretheit des Anlasses, der sie
hervorbrachte.  Mit zunehmender Sprachbenutzung jedoch wurde die
unmittelbare individuelle Projektion aufgegeben.  Der
Verallgemeinerungsgrad der Sprache insgesamt wurde viel groesser als
derjenige ihrer einzelnen Komponenten (der einzelnen Zeichen) oder
irgendwelcher anderer Zeichen.  Doch selbst auf dieser allgemeinen
Ebene der Sprache behielt das Zeichensystem seine charakteristische
pragmatische Funktion bei: naemlich die Herausbildung praktischer
Erfahrungen, nicht die Bereitstellung von Mitteln fuer die gemeinsame
Kategorisierung von Erfahrungen.  In jedem Zeichen und mehr noch in
jeder Sprache treffen biologische und artifizielle Aspekte
aufeinander.  Dominiert das biologische Element, vollziehen sich
Zeichenerfahrungen als Reaktionen.  Dominiert das kulturelle Element,
wird die Zeichen- oder Spracherfahrung zu einer Form der
Interpretation, also zu einer Fortsetzung der semiotischen Erfahrung.
Jegliche Interpretation entspricht dem unabschliessbaren Prozess der
ausdifferenzierenden Abtrennung vom Biologischen und ist
gleichbedeutend mit der Herausbildung von Kultur.  Unter dem Begriff
der Kultur verstehen wir die Natur des Menschen und ihre
Objektivierung in Erzeugnissen, Organisationsformen, Gedanken,
Haltungen, Werten und Kunstwerken.

Die praktische Erfahrung der Zeichenbildung--von der Verwendung von
Zweigen, Felsbrocken und Pelzen bis zu den ersten primitiven
Gravierungen (auf Stein, Knochen und Holz), von Lauten und Gesten bis
zur Sprachartikulation--trug zu Veraenderungen des Lebensalltags bei
(Jagd, Schutzsuche, gemeinschaftliche Verrichtungen) und damit
letztlich zur Veraenderung des Menschen.  In einer von inhaltsschweren
Details gekennzeichneten Welt, in der die Menschen ihre Identitaet
durch Kampf um Lebensressourcen und in der kreativen Suche nach
besseren Alternativen fanden, veraenderte sich zwar nicht die
verfuegbare Information, aber die lebenspraktischen Implikationen der
Details traten zunehmend ins Bewusstsein.  Die Aneignung von Wissen
vollzog sich durch dessen Anwendung in der Arbeit; jede daraus
abgeleitete Erfahrung eroeffnete neue Interaktionsmuster.

Zeichen ermoeglichten die kollektive Teilhabe an der Erfahrung.  Die
genetische UEbermittlung von Wissen lief relativ langsam ab.  Sie
beherrschte die Anfangsstadien der menschlichen Entwicklung, als der
Mensch den Mustern seiner natuerlichen Umgebung seine eigenen
Handlungsmuster einpraegte.  Die semiotische, insbesondere die
sprachliche, Wissensvermittlung verlaeuft schneller, kann indes die
Vererbung nicht ersetzen.  Wir koennen die Spuren des menschlichen
Lebens etwa 2,5 Millionen Jahre zurueckverfolgen, die der
Sprachanfaenge etwa 200000 Jahre.  Formen der Landwirtschaft als
etablierte Erfahrung und Lebensform entwickelten sich vor etwa 19000,
Schriftformen vor etwa 5000 Jahren (nach Schaetzung einiger Gelehrter
vor etwa 10000 Jahren).  Den immer kuerzeren Zyklen der
Menschheitsentwicklung entspricht dabei die Tatsache, dass neben den
genetischen zunehmend auch andere Mittel am Entwicklungsprozess
beteiligt waren.  Was wir heute als unsere geistigen Faehigkeiten
bezeichnen, ist das Ergebnis eines relativ kurzen, komprimierten
Entwicklungsprozesses.  Erste Zeichenspuren Zeichen koennen
aufgezeichnet werden--in und auf unterschiedlichsten Materialien; das
gleiche gilt fuer die Sprache, die indes nicht in Form eines
Schriftsystems entstand.  Der Ishango Knochen aus Afrika ist einige
tausend Jahre aelter als jedes Schriftsystem; mit den Quipu-Schnueren
nahmen die Inkas eine chronologische und statistische Erfassung von
Menschen, Tieren und Waren vor; auch in China, Japan und Indien
kannte man Aufzeichnungsmethoden, die der Schriftlichkeit
vorausgingen.

Die polygenetische Herausbildung von Schriftsprache ist in mancherlei
Hinsicht bedeutsam.  Zum einen bot sie eine neue, vom individuellen
Sprecher losgeloeste Vermittlungsinstanz.  Zum zweiten schuf sie einen
im Vergleich zum muendlichen Ausdruck hoeheren Allgemeinheitsgrad, der
unabhaengig von Zeit, Raum und anderen Aufzeichnungsmethoden war.  Und
drittens trug alles, was in Zeichen und darueber hinaus in
ausformulierte Sprache hineinprojiziert wurde, zur Formation von
Bedeutung bei--als Ergebnis des Verstehens von Sprache, das sich aus
ihrer Verwendung ergab.  Erst dadurch erhielt die Sprache ihre
semantische und syntaktische Dimension.

Wenn wir Fragen der Schriftkultur und der Sprachentstehung verknuepfen,
dann ist deren gemeinsame Grundlage die Schriftsprache.  Gleichwohl
geben uns Vorgaenge, die der Schriftsprachlichkeit vorausgingen,
Aufschluesse darueber, welche Faktoren die Schriftsprache erforderlich
machten und warum manche Kulturen niemals eine Schriftsprache
entwickelt haben.  Dies wiederum koennte trotz des weit
zurueckliegenden Zeitrahmens (von tausenden von Jahren) erklaeren,
warum Schreiben und Lesen nicht notwendigerweise unser heutiges und
zukuenftiges Leben und Arbeiten beherrschen muessen.  Zumindest koennten
wir das Verhaeltnis zwischen Mensch, Sprache und Dasein besser
verstehen.  Wir betrachten das Wort als etwas selbstverstaendlich
Gegebenes und fragen uns, ob es je einen Menschen ohne Wort gegeben
hat.  Als das Wort aber erst einmal durch die Moeglichkeit seiner
Aufzeichnung etabliert war, beeinflusste es nicht nur die zukuenftige
Entwicklung, sondern auch das Verstaendnis der Vergangenheit.

Das Wort bemaechtigt sich der Vergangenheit und verleiht den
Erklaerungen, die die Existenz des Wortes voraussetzen, ihre
Legitimitaet.  Es beruht auf einem Notationssystem, das zugleich eine
Art eingebautes Gedaechtnis und ein Mechanismus fuer Assoziationen,
Permutationen und Substitutionen ist.  Wenn wir aber die Urspruenge
des Lesens und Schreibens so weit zurueckverlegen, dann erweist sich
der Gegensatz von Schriftlichkeit und Schriftlosigkeit als
Strukturmerkmal nur einer der zahlreichen menschlichen
Entwicklungsperioden.  In einer so weiten zeitlichen Perspektive
widerspricht unsere Auffassung von Notation (zu der wir auch Bilder,
den Ishango Knochen, die Quipu-Schnuere, die Vinca-Figuren usw.
zaehlen) dem logokratischen Sprachmodell.  Ein- und mehrsilbige
Sprachelemente, hoerbare Lautfolgen (und entsprechende Atemtechniken,
die Pausen vorsehen und Synchronisierungsmechanismen ermoeglichen)
sowie natuerliche Mnemotechniken (Kiesel, Astknoten, Steingestalten
usw.) sind dem Wort vorausgehende Komponenten einer vorsprachlichen
Notation.  Sie entsprechen allesamt einem durch direkte Interaktion
gekennzeichneten Entwicklungsstadium.  Sie beziehen sich auf eine
kleine Skala menschlichen Handelns, in welcher Zeit und Raum noch in
Form natuerlicher Strukturen (Tag-Nacht, nah-fern, usw.) eingeteilt
werden koennen.

Der entscheidende Entwicklungsschritt in der Selbstkonstituierung des
Menschen wurde mit dem UEbergang von aus der Natur ausgewaehlten
Zeichen zum Bezeichnen vollzogen, ein Prozess, der zu etablierten
Klangmustern und schliesslich zum Wort fuehrte.  Diese Veraenderung
fuehrte lineare Beziehungen in einen sich als zufaellig oder chaotisch
darbietenden Bereich ein.  Auch entwickelten sich neue Formen der
Interaktion: Namensgebung (durch Assoziation, etwa wenn Clans die
Namen von Tieren trugen), Ordnen und Zaehlen (zunaechst die paarweise
Zuordnung der gezaehlten Gegenstaende zu anderen Gegenstaenden) oder die
Aufzeichnung von Regelmaessigkeiten (des Wetters, der
Himmelsbeschaffenheit, biologischer Zyklen), soweit sie sich auf das
Ergebnis praktischer Taetigkeiten auswirkten.


Skala und Schwelle

Auf den vorangegangenen Seiten ist der Begriff der Skala als
wichtiger Parameter der Menschheitsentwicklung wiederholt verwendet
worden.  Da er fuer die Erklaerung grosser Veraenderungen im menschlichen
Handeln von zentraler Bedeutung ist, soll er etwas naeher erlaeutert
werden.  So geht die Entwicklung von praeverbalen Zeichen zu
Notationsformen und in unserer Zeit von Alphabetismus zu einem
Stadium jenseits der Schriftlichkeit (PostAlphabetismus) einher mit
einer Fortentwicklung der (Erfahrungs- und Handlungs-) Skala des
Menschen.  Reine Zahlen--etwa darueber, wie viele Menschen in einem
bestimmten Gebiet leben oder in einem bestimmten praktischen
Erfahrungszusammenhang interagieren, die Lebensdauer von Menschen
unter bestimmten Bedingungen, Sterblichkeitsrate,
Familiengroesse--sagen dabei wenig oder gar nichts aus.  Nur wenn
Zahlen zu Lebensumstaenden in Beziehung gesetzt werden koennen, sind
sie aufschlussreich.  Der Begriff der Skala drueckt derartige
Beziehungen aus.

So brachte die Haltung von Haustieren, die eine entscheidende
Erweiterung der Handlungsskala bedeutete, mit sich, dass bestimmte
Tierkrankheiten auf die Menschen uebertragen wurden und deren Leben
und Arbeit nachhaltig beeintraechtigten.  Der Schnupfen wurde wohl vom
Pferd auf den Menschen uebertragen, die Grippe vom Schwein, die
Windpocken vom Rind.  Auch wissen wir, dass sich ueber einen laengeren
Zeitraum gesehen Infektionskrankheiten (Gelbfieber, Malaria oder
Masern) negativ auf grosse, stationaere menschliche Populationen
auswirken.  Wichtige Erkenntnisse liefern uns bisweilen auch jene
isolierten Volksstaemme, deren heutige Lebensformen denen aus weit
zurueckliegenden Entwicklungsstadien noch weitgehend aehnlich sind,
also zum Beispiel die Indianerstaemme des Amazonas.  Sie weisen
Anpassungsstrategien auf, die wir ohne Anschauung kaum verstehen
koennten.  Die aus der Beobachtung gewonnenen statistischen Daten
koennen dabei unsere auf dem Wissen um biologische Mechanismen
beruhenden Modelle deutlich verbessern.

Der Begriff der Skala bezieht derartige UEberlegungen mit ein, denn er
erhellt, dass sich die Lebenserwartung in unterschiedlichen
pragmatischen Lebenszusammenhaengen drastisch unterscheidet.  Eine
Lebenserwartung von weniger als 30 Jahren (die sich aus einer hohen
Rate der Kindersterblichkeit, aus Krankheiten und den Gefahren der
natuerlichen Umwelt ergibt) erklaert sich aus den Umstaenden der relativ
stationaeren Bevoelkerung der Jaeger und Sammler.  Etwa zwanzig Jahre
hoeher lag die Lebenserwartung in den Siedlungsformen vor den
Staedtegruendungen (die sich zu unterschiedlichen Zeiten in Kleinasien,
Nordafrika, dem Fernen Osten, Suedamerika und Europa entwickelten).
Die Landwirtschaft fuehrte zu mannigfaltigeren Ressourcen und setzte
eine Dynamik aus geringerer Sterblichkeitsrate, hoeherer Geburtenrate
und veraenderten anatomischen Merkmalen (hoeherem Koerperwuchs) in Gang.

Im vorliegenden Zusammenhang sind besonders die Ergebnisse der auf
alte Sprachfamilien gerichteten Sprachgeschichte interessant, die
eine Beziehung zwischen der Verbreitung von Sprachfamilien ueber weite
Gebiete und einer sich ausweitenden landwirtschaftlichen Bevoelkerung
erkennen laesst.  Mit der sogenannten neolithischen Revolution
entwickelten sich in manchen Gemeinschaften Methoden der
Nahrungsproduktion, die nicht mehr auf Suche, Jagd und Fallenstellen
beruhten.  Die veraenderten Bedingungen beguenstigten einen
Bevoelkerungszuwachs, der sich wiederum auf die Beziehungen zwischen
den Individuen und kleineren sozialen Gruppen auswirkte.  Einzelne
Gruppen loesten sich vom Stamm los, um nach einem Lebensumfeld mit
geringerem Konkurrenzkampf um Lebensressourcen zu suchen.  Zugleich
aber foerderten die neuen pragmatischen Bedingungen eine erhoehte
Bevoelkerungsdichte, mit der die Natur der Beziehungen komplexer wurde.

Uns interessiert die Richtung, die diese Entwicklung nahm, und das
Zusammenspiel der vielen daran beteiligten Faktoren.  Vor allem
wollen wir wissen, auf welche Weise Skala und Veraenderungen in den
praktischen Lebenserfahrungen der Menschen zusammenhaengen.  Setzt
eine Entdeckung oder Erfindung eine Veraenderung der Skala voraus oder
bewirkt sie, gegebenenfalls im Verbund mit anderen Faktoren, diese
Veraenderung erst?  Polygenetische Erklaerungen solch komplexer
Entwicklungen wie diejenigen, die neue Erfahrungsebenen, damit
wiederum erhoehte Bevoelkerungszahlen und diversifizierte
Interaktionsformen ermoeglichen, fuehren viele Variablen ins Feld.
Ausweislich archaeologischer und sprachwissenschaftlicher Forschungen
sind alle grossen Sprachfamilien dort zu verorten, wo der pragmatische
Lebenszusammenhang landwirtschaftlicher Lebensformen nachzuweisen ist.
Zuverlaessige Belege finden sich fuer zwei Gebiete in China: das
Becken des Gelben Flusses, wo der Anbau von Futterhirse nachgewiesen
ist, und das Yangtse-Becken, in dem Reis angebaut wurde.  Von hier
aus verbreiteten sich die austronesischen Sprachen tausende von
Kilometern weit.  Hieraus ergibt sich die interessante Korrelation
zwischen der Natur der menschlichen Erfahrung, der sie ermoeglichenden
Skala und der Verbreitung von Sprache.  AEhnliches gilt fuer das Gebiet
von Neuguinea, wo die Verbreitung der Papuasprachen in Verbindung mit
dem Anbau der Taroknolle steht: mit der Suche nach geeigneten
Anbaugebieten und den Auseinandersetzungen mit umherstreifenden
Volksstaemmen.

Angeborene Faehigkeiten (Rufen, Werfen, Laufen, Pfluecken, Brechen und
Biegen) kennzeichneten ein Entwicklungsstadium, in dem sich der
Mensch in Gruppen oder Gemeinschaften mit begrenzter Skala
organisierte.  Andere, nicht angeborene Faehigkeiten wie Pflanzen,
Kochen, Hueten, Singen und die Verwendung von Werkzeugen werden bewusst
und aus der Kenntnis ihrer Ursache heraus entwickelt.  Sie ergaben
sich, als Veraenderungen der Skala bezueglich Bevoelkerung und Leistung
neue, der Gemeinschaft angemessene und allein durch die angeborenen
Faehigkeiten nicht zu erreichende Effizienzebenen erforderten.  Solche
Faehigkeiten entwickelten sich schnell.  Die neue Praxis foerderte
modifizierte Mittel der Selbstorganisation: rudimentaere Formen des
Planens, Reduktionsstrategien zum UEberleben (Aufgabenteilung beim
Loesen von Problemen) und Koalitionsbildungen, die sich auf immer
hoeheren Ebenen entfalteten.  An einem bestimmten Punkt der
Skalenentwicklung schliesslich ergaben sich differenzierte
Arbeitsablaeufe und neue kognitive Moeglichkeiten zur Bewahrung und
Vermittlung von Wissen, das sich auf diese Arbeitspraxis bezog.

Es bleibt die Frage: Bringen Strukturveraenderungen eine neue Skala
hervor, oder bewirkt die Skala Strukturveraenderungen?  Der Prozess ist
komplex insofern, als die dem menschlichen Handeln zugrundeliegende
Struktur den Beduerfnissen des UEberlebens angepasst und auf die
zahlreichen Faktoren abgestimmt ist, die die individuellen und
gemeinschaftlichen Erfahrungen beeinflussen.  Skala und Grundstruktur
sind voneinander abhaengig.  Das ergibt sich schon daraus, dass die
Skala sowohl Moeglichkeiten als auch Beduerfnisse erfasst.  Eine groessere
Zahl von Individuen mit einander ergaenzenden Faehigkeiten haben bei
komplexen Handlungszielen groessere Erfolgsaussichten.  Zugleich nehmen
die Beduerfnisse zu, da diese Individuen nicht nur ihre Person in den
Erfahrungszusammenhang einbinden, sondern auch ausserhalb dieser
Zusammenhaenge liegende Verpflichtungen.  Die Grundstruktur
menschlichen Handelns umfasst Elemente der menschlichen Begabung--die
ihrerseits Veraenderungen unterworfen ist, die sich aus neuen
Herausforderungen und Lebensumstaenden ergeben--wie auch Elemente der
menschlichen Beziehungen, die wechselseitig die Skala menschlicher
Erfahrung beeinflussen und von ihr beeinflusst werden.  Aus der
dynamischen Spannung zwischen Skala und all jenen Elementen, die die
Grundstruktur ausmachen, ergeben sich Veraenderungen des pragmatischen
Handlungsrahmens.  Die Entwicklung der Sprache ist ein Beispiel fuer
derartige Veraenderungen.  Gesprochene Sprache entwickelte sich
zusammen mit den Fruehformen der Landbewirtung als Erweiterung der fuer
die Jagd und das Sammeln von Nahrungsmitteln erforderlichen
Kommunikationsmittel.  In einem spaeteren Entwicklungsstadium bildeten
sich Notationssysteme und fortschrittlichere Werkzeuge heraus.  Die
hierdurch ermoeglichte fortgeschrittenere praktische Erfahrung
foerderte handwerkliche Faehigkeiten und damit spezialisiertere
Arbeitsformen.  Notation und Lesefaehigkeit als neue kognitive
Erfahrungen fuehrten zur Schrift.  Diese wurde erforderlich, als sich
die Lebenspraxis auf Handel verlegte und ueber die Unmittelbarkeit des
Hier und Jetzt und des direkten Miteinander hinausging.  Die
Grundstruktur der Schriftlichkeit wurde der Sequentialitaet der
allgemeinen praktischen Erfahrungen sowie der Empfindung von
Relationen und Ablaeufen in hoechstem Masse gerecht.

Unterschiedliche Kommunikationsformen entwickelten sich mithin in dem
Masse, in dem sich die Interaktionsskala des Menschen auffaecherte.
Die Schriftkultur entsprach dabei einem qualitativ neuen
Entwicklungsstand.  Wenn wir die Sprache jener Skala zurechnen, die
den UEbergang vom Jaeger- und Sammlerstadium zur Landbewirtschaftung
markiert, dann muessen wir die Entstehung von Schriftkultur der
naechsten Entwicklungsstufe zurechnen--der Herstellung von
Produktionsmitteln.  Wir koennen in diesem Zusammenhang auf die
Metapher der kritischen Masse bzw. der Schwelle zurueckgreifen.  Damit
ersetzen wir nicht den Begriff der Skala, damit definieren wir einen
Wert, eine Komplexitaetsebene oder einen neuen Attraktor (wie er in
der Chaostheorie genannt wird).  Kritische Masse bezeichnet dabei
eine niedrigere Schwelle--bis zu diesem Wert vollzog sich menschliche
Interaktion optimal mittels referentieller Zeichen, auf Gleichheit
basierender Darstellungen oder Sprache.  Auf der niedrigeren Schwelle
koennen sich Individuen und die sozialen Gruppen, denen sie angehoeren,
noch kohaerent definieren.  Allerdings macht sich eine gewisse
Instabilitaet geltend: ein und dieselben Zeichen druecken nicht mehr
aehnliche oder aequivalente Erfahrungen aus.  Hier bezieht sich
kritische Masse auf Zahl oder Menge (der Menschen, der geteilten
Ressourcen, der ausgeuebten Interaktionen usw.) und auf Qualitaet
(unterschiedliche Ergebnisse im Bemuehen der Selbstsetzung).
UEberkommene Mittel erweisen sich aufgrund neuartiger praktischer
Erfahrungen als unzureichend.  Aus diesen Erfahrungen ergeben sich
neue Strategien, insbesondere die Optimierung der betreffenden
Zeichensysteme (Signale, Sprache, Notation, Schrift).
Notationssysteme wurden erforderlich, als das verfuegbare und
aufzubewahrende Wissen (Inventare, Mythen, Genealogien) die
Moeglichkeiten der muendlichen UEberlieferung ueberstieg. Der Begriff der
kritischen Masse hilft uns zu erklaeren, warum einige Kulturen niemals
eine Schriftkultur entwickeln mussten oder warum eine einzige, allein
vorherrschende Form der Schriftkultur unserer heutigen Zeit nicht
mehr angemessen ist.


Zeichen und Werkzeuge

Auf die Natur gerichtete praktische Erfahrungen beinhalteten die
Erkenntnis von Unterschieden: veraenderte Farben zu verschiedenen
Jahreszeiten, die Vielfalt von Flora und Fauna, Veraenderungen des
Wetters und der Himmelskonstellationen.  Menschliche Beduerfnisse
objektivieren sich in Jagd und Nahrungssuche, Fischfang und
Schutzsuche sowie in der Suche nach dem anderen, ob aus
Geschlechtstrieb oder dem Zwang zur Kooperation.  Auf die Vielfalt
der Natur reagiert der Mensch mit einer Vielfalt von elementaren
Operationen.  Daraus erwuchs zunaechst eine einfache Sprache aus
Handlungen.  Sie kannte keinen wirklichen Dialog.  In der Natur kann
Schreien und Kreischen in einer bestimmten begrenzten Abfolge Gefahr
signalisieren.  Ansonsten kann die Natur menschliche Zeichen, Bilder
oder Laute nicht verstehen.  Zum Anlocken oder Fangen von Beute oder
zur Vermeidung von Gefahren koennen Geraeusche, Farben oder Formen
dienen.  Ihre unbegrenzte Variations- und Kombinationsmoeglichkeit in
einem gegebenen Handlungsrahmen macht sie zu Zeichen.  Vor dem
Hintergrund erkannter Unterschiede wurden auch AEhnlichkeiten in
Erscheinungsform und Handlungsweisen bewusst, was sich in
entsprechenden Interaktionsformen niederschlug.  Sobald sich die
Erfahrung innerhalb einer sozialen Gruppe stabilisiert hatte, wurde
sie ihrerseits zeichenhaft und als solche kohaerent in deren
Handlungsrahmen eingebunden.

Elementare Formen der Lebenspraxis bewahrten eine enge Bindung
zwischen dem Individuum und dem Objekt, auf das sich die Handlung
bezog.  Extraktion dessen, was vielen Aufgaben gemeinsam war, fuehrte
zu einer Akkumulation von Erfahrung.  Und mit der Erfahrung stellte
sich eine gewisse Distanz zwischen Individuum bzw.  Gruppe und
Aufgabe ein.  Die Sprache aus Handlungen veraenderte sich in diesem
Prozess unaufhoerlich.  Evaluation begann als Vergleich.  Daraus
ergaben sich Vorlieben, Wiederholungsmuster und Auswahlverfahren, bis
sich schliesslich eine bestimmte Handlungsvorschrift herausbildete.
Die Interpretation natuerlicher Muster bezueglich des Wetters (Wechsel
der Jahreszeiten, Sturm, Duerre usw.), der gejagten Tiere, der Suche
nach Wurzeln und Knollen oder der Landwirtschaft (wie wir sie im
Rueckblick nennen) ergab ein Repertoire der beobachteten Merkmale und
allmaehlich eine Beobachtungsmethode.  Die beobachteten Phaenomene
wurden auf ihre Relevanz geprueft und wurden so zu Zeichen.  Sie
bezogen den Beobachter mit ein, der sie sich einpraegte und mit
zweckdienlichen Handlungsmustern assoziierte.  Diese Form des
Lesens--also die Beobachtung aller moeglichen Muster und Assoziationen
bezueglich der sich stellenden Aufgaben--ging den Notationsformen und
der Schrift voraus und war vermutlich die eigentliche Grundlage fuer
deren allmaehliche Herausbildung.  Dieses Lesen filterte das Relevante
heraus, jenes Charakteristikum--eines Tieres, einer Pflanze, einer
Wetterlage--, das die erfolgreiche Bewaeltigung einer Aufgabe
beeinflusste.  Die Sprache aus Handlungen gewann folglich an Kohaerenz
und entwickelte staendig neue Zeichen.  Rituale stellen eine Art
kollektiven Bewusstseins dar, einen Kalender sui generis als Ausdruck
eines impliziten Zeitbewusstseins.  Sie sind ein Lernmittel und helfen,
die auf die Arbeit bezogenen Zeichen zu verstehen und unter
veraenderten Umstaenden die entsprechenden Handlungsstrategien zu
befolgen.  Die Einheit von Natur und Mensch wird im Ritual unablaessig
bekraeftigt.

Werkzeuge sind "Verlaengerungen" der menschlichen Physis.  Sie sind
die entscheidenden Mittel zur Erreichung eines Ziels.  Zeichen
hingegen sind Mittel der Selbstreflexion und ihrer Natur nach
Kommunikationsmittel.  Auch Werkzeuge koennen als Zeichen
interpretiert werden und dadurch die selbstreflektive Natur des
Menschen ausdruecken, allerdings auf andere Weise.  Sie sind ueber ihre
Funktion definiert, nicht etwa hinsichtlich der Bedeutung, die sie in
einem Kommunikationszusammenhang heraufbeschwoeren koennten.

In diesen Fruehstadien der Menschheit markierte die Zeichenbenutzung
den UEbergang vom Zufaelligen zum Systematischen.  Die Verwendung von
Werkzeugen und die relativ uniforme Struktur der sich stellenden
Aufgaben fuehrte zu einem Methodenbewusstsein.  Werkzeuge bekunden den
geschlossenen und homogenen Charakter des pragmatischen
Handlungsrahmens auf dieser primitiven Entwicklungsstufe.  Der
Synkretismus von Werkzeugen und Zeichen findet seinen Nachklang in
der synkretistischen Natur der daraus hervorgegangenen Zeichen der
praktischen Erfahrung.  Was wir heute als Religion, Kunst,
Wissenschaft, Philosophie und Ethik entwickelt haben, ist in nuce auf
undifferenzierte, synkretistische Weise im Zeichen repraesentiert.
Mit der Beobachtung von repetitiven Mustern wurden auch moegliche
Abweichungen erkannt.  Indem die Menschen diese Erfahrung in komplexe
Zeichen uebertrugen, wurde sie verstehbar und eindeutig und konnte
ueber die Zeiten hinaus bewahrt werden.

Wir sollten uns solche Kategorien wie Synkretismus, Verstaendnis,
repetitive Muster als Kategorien des praktischen Handelns
vergegenwaertigen.  Ein Zeichen kann aus einem einfachen Rhythmus
bestehen.  Es sollte selbst unter unguenstigen Umstaenden leicht zu
erkennen sein (der Schlag des Donners, der Schrei eines Tieres).  Die
Menschen sollten daraus die gleichen Reaktionen ableiten koennen (Lauf!
sollte nicht mit Halt!, Wirf! nicht mit Wirf nicht! oder etwas
aehnlichem verwechselt werden).  Vor allem muss die Eindeutigkeit ueber
die Zeiten hinaus erhalten bleiben.  Mit der Mannigfaltigkeit der
praktischen Erfahrungen wuchs auch die Mannigfaltigkeit der
verschiedenen Sprachstufen.  Rhythmus, Farbe, Form, Koerperausdruck
und Bewegung als Erfahrungsbestandteile des taeglichen Lebens wurden
in Rituale eingebunden.  Gegenstaende wurden als das gezeigt, was sie
sind--Tierkoepfe, Geweihenden und Krallen, AEste und Baumstaemme,
aufgeborstene Felsbrocken.  Sie wurden bearbeitet mit Feuer, Wasser
und scharfen Steinen, die sich zum Hauen und Schneiden eigneten.

Der Mensch wird zum Menschen, indem er seine eigene Natur
konstituiert.  Zu diesem Vorgang gehoert die Externalisierung
bestimmter Charakteristika, damit sie im Rahmen der sich
herausbildenden Kultur von allen geteilt werden koennen.  Wir wissen,
dass es eine Trennung zwischen der Welt auf der einen und dem
denkenden Subjekt auf der anderen Seite nicht gibt.  Die Menschen
finden ihre Identitaet und die ihrer Gattung durch Vergleich, durch
Erkennen von AEhnlichkeiten und Unterschieden.  Diese beziehen sich
auf ihre Existenz; die gemeinsame Bewusstmachung dieser AEhnlichkeiten
und Unterschiede ist Teil der menschlichen Interaktion.  Insofern
wird die Welt im Augenblick ihrer Entdeckung konstituiert.  Die
Dynamik zwischen Identitaet und Unterscheidung macht auch deutlich,
warum Sprache etwas anderes ist als das "Abbild unserer Gedanken".
Sprache ist auch mehr als der Akt ihrer Verwendung.  Wir schaffen
unsere Sprache genau so, wie wir uns unablaessig selbst schaffen.
Dieses schoepferische Tun vollzieht sich nicht in einem leeren Raum,
sondern im pragmatischen Handlungsrahmen unserer gegenseitigen
Beziehungen und Abhaengigkeiten.  Der UEbergang von Direktheit und
Unmittelbarkeit zu Indirektheit und Vermittlung und den damit
verbundenen Vorstellungen von Raum und Zeit spiegelt sich in
mancherlei Hinsicht im Entstehungsprozess der Sprache.  Die
Herausbildung von Zeichen, ihre Funktionsweise, die Entstehung von
Sprache und die Entwicklung der Schrift verweisen auf die
Selbstbestimmung und die Selbstbewahrung des Menschen, so wie sie
sich im praktischen Akt der Selbstkonstituierung der menschlichen
Gattung ergeben.



Kapitel 2:

Von der Muendlichkeit zur Schriftlichkeit

Wenn wir im Verein mit zahlreichen Sprachhistorikern die Anfaenge der
Sprache mit den fruehen Formen der Landwirtschaft korrelieren, so
heisst das, dass wir von einer pragmatischen Grundlegung der Sprache
als Praxis ausgehen.  Sprache ist nicht nur passiver Zeuge bei der
dynamischen Entfaltung der menschlichen Gattung.  Die Vielfalt der
praktischen Erfahrung spiegelt sich in der Sprache und ist durch die
praktische Erfahrung der Sprachbenutzung erst ermoeglicht worden.  Die
Anfaenge der Sprache wie die der Schrift liegen im Bereich des
Natuerlichen.  Daher muessen wir auch die biologischen Umstaende, unter
denen der Mensch mit seiner Aussenwelt in Beziehung tritt, mit
beruecksichtigen.  Die praktische Erfahrung der Selbstkonstituierung
durch Sprache ist zugleich die Grundlage der Kultur.  Der Akt des
Schreibens ist wie der Akt der Werkzeugherstellung grundlegend fuer
eine Spezies, die ihre Natur selbst definiert.  Daher muessen wir
neben der biologischen Identitaet des Menschen die kulturschaffenden
Aspekte gleichermassen beruecksichtigen.

Wir wollen zunaechst betrachten, welche Implikationen sich aus dem
biologischen Faktor ergeben.  Wir wissen zum Beispiel, dass die Zahl
der Laute, die der Mensch erzeugen kann, sehr hoch ist.  Aus dieser
praktisch unbegrenzten Zahl von Lauten sind indes nur etwa vierzig in
den indogermanischen Sprachen identifizierbar, im Gegensatz zum
Chinesischen und Japanischen.  Es ist zwar nicht moeglich, zu zeigen,
wie der biologische Zuschnitt des einzelnen und die Struktur seiner
Erfahrung in das Sprachsystem projiziert sind; dennoch waere es unklug,
diese Projizierung, die sich in jedem Moment unseres Daseins
vollzieht, nicht in Rechnung zu stellen.  Beim Sprechen werden
Muskeln, Stimmbaender und andere anatomische Funktionselemente
aktiviert und entsprechend ihren Merkmalen verwendet.  Zum Sprechen
gehoert das Hoeren, beim Schreiben und Lesen kommt noch das Sehen hinzu.
Weitere dynamische Merkmale wie Augenbewegung, Atmung und
Herzschlag gehoeren zu den biologischen Implikationen der
Sprachverwendung.  Was wir sind, tun, sagen, schreiben oder lesen,
steht in einem unaufloeslichen Zusammenhang.  Die Erfahrungen, auf
deren Hintergund sich die Sprachverwendung vollzieht, und die
biologischen Eigenschaften derer, die in eine Sprache eingebunden
sind, sind dabei so unterschiedlich, dass kaum je ein Ereignis, so
einfach es sich auch gestalten mag, von verschiedenen Menschen durch
Sprache (oder durch irgend ein anderes Zeichensystem) auf identische
oder aehnliche Weise ausgedrueckt wird.

Erste Erkundungen der Geschichte oder das persoenliche Fragen nach dem
Verlauf vergangener Ereignisse beruhen auf Muendlichkeit, beziehen den
Mythos mit ein und muenden schliesslich in den Versuch, Ereignisse an
Ort und Zeit zu knuepfen.  Die ersten Logographen rekonstruierten die
Genealogien von Personen, die in tatsaechliche Ereignisse verwickelt
waren (Kriege, Gruendungen von Clans, Staemmen oder Dynastien) oder in
der zeitgenoessischen Literatur hervorgehoben wurden (zum Beispiel den
Epen Homers oder in der Genesis).  Als der Mensch aus dem Stadium der
Erinnerung (mnemai) in das Stadium des fixierten Berichts (logoi)
fortschritt, entwickelte er ein Bewusstsein von Zeit und
Geschichtlichkeit.  Der gemeinsame Bezug auf Ereignisse machte dabei
zugleich Unterschiede im Verhaeltnis zu diesen Ereignissen bewusst.

Die Kodierung der sozialen Erfahrung, angefangen bei eher naiven
Formen (Familie, Religion, Krankheit) bis hin zu komplexen
Regelwerken (der Zeremonien, der Machtausuebung und des militaerischen
Verhaltens) ergab sich aus einer Praxis, die sich unter Mitwirkung
der Sprache zunehmend diversifizierte.  Die Spannung zwischen
Muendlichkeit und Schriftlichkeit drueckt dabei die Spannung aus, die
zwischen einer eher homogenen Lebensform und sich bestaendig
differenzierenden Lebensformen besteht, welche die ueber lange Zeit
hinaus gueltigen Grenzen durchbrochen haben.  Im Sprachraum der
zahlreichen chinesischen Sprachen wird dies deutlicher als in den
westlichen Sprachen.  Die ideographische Schrift des Chinesischen,
welche die vielen gesprochenen Dialekte in sich vereinigt, hat ihre
Konkretheit und damit die Tradition als einen bewaehrten Zugang zur
Welt bewahrt.  So ist auch die chinesische Kultur vergleichsweise
stark durch Muendlichkeit gepraegt.  Die aus einer solchen Sprache
abgeleitete Philosophie verteidigt, durch das Grundprinzip des Tao im
Konfuzianismus, einen etablierten und allen gemeinsamen Mechanismus
der Wissensvermittlung.

Im Gegensatz zur gesprochenen Sprache ist die Schrift relativ jung.
Einige Sprachhistoriker datieren die Anfaenge der Schrift auf 4000 bis
3000 v.Chr.; andere gehen bis auf 6000 v.  Ch. oder noch weiter
zurueck.  Fuer eine Wiederbelebung derartiger Debatten gibt es jedoch
weder neues Material noch neue ueberzeugende Interpretationen der
vorhandenen Quellen.  Insgesamt sind die Grenzen zwischen den
einzelnen kulturellen Stadien der Menschheit schwer zu bestimmen.
Wir werden vermutlich niemals genau wissen, ob die Bilder
(Hoehlenmalereien oder Petroglyphen) den Woertern vorausgingen oder
deren Folge waren.  Moeglicherweise entwickelten sich die Sprachen,
die ueber eine Notation, ueber Zeichnungen, Gravierungen und
Rituale--einschliesslich des umfangreichen Repertoires an
artikulierter Gestik--verfuegten, relativ zeitgleich nebeneinander.
Einige Schrifthistoriker vertreten die Meinung, dass es Bilder ohne
Worte nicht haette geben koennen.  Andere lehnen das logokratische
Modell ab und glauben, dass Bilder nicht nur dem geschriebenen,
sondern vielleicht sogar dem gesprochenen Wort vorausgingen.  AEhnlich
widerspruechliche Theorien setzen die Herausbildung von Ritualen vor
oder nach den Zeichnungen, vor oder nach der Entwicklung der Schrift
an.  Ich glaube, dass die fruehen menschlichen Ausdrucksformen
synkretistisch und polymorph waren und sich unmittelbar aus einem
pragmatischen Rahmen der Selbstkonstituierung heraus entwickelten,
der durch die Erfahrung der Vielfalt bestimmt war.


Individuelles und kollektives Gedaechtnis

Anthropologen haben versucht, die ueberlieferte Erfahrung zu
kategorisieren, um zu sehen, wie sich Muendlichkeit und spaeter
Schriftlichkeit (die einfachen Notationsformen) zu den einzelnen
Kategorien verhalten.  Man hat dabei auf die materielle Umwelt
verwiesen--Ressourcen im weitesten Sinn--, auf erfolgreiches Handeln
und auf Woerter in ihrem Bezug zum allgemeineren Rahmen (Zeit, Raum,
Zielsetzungen usw.) Man vermutet, dass der Mensch zunehmend von
kuenstlich erstellten Notationsmitteln abhaengig wurde.  In der Folge
aktivierte er in geringerem Mass seine rechte Gehirnhaelfte, was zu
einer verminderten Schaerfe der entsprechenden Gehirnfunktionen fuehrte.
Der durch den UEberlebenstrieb der Spezies diktierte Drang nach
Stabilitaet und Dauerhaftigkeit wurde in Zeichenfolgen
hineinprojiziert, die zunaechst noch nicht die sichere Einbindung in
ein Sprachsystem aufweisen konnten.  Dennoch verfestigte sich diese
Erfahrung des Umgangs mit Zeichen und wurde durch die Moeglichkeiten
und Zwaenge der Muendlichkeit vereinheitlicht.

Sprache ist gleichwohl nicht der unmittelbare Ausdruck von Erfahrung.
Sie ist sogar weniger umfassend als die Zeichen, die zur Sprache
hinfuehrten.  Jedem Gespraech geht etwas voraus--eine gemeinsame
Erfahrung als Grundlage des Gespraechs und Hintergrund fuer weitere
gemeinsame Erfahrungen.  Alle fruehen Formen menschlicher Taetigkeit
und Interaktion wurden zu Zeichen, wenn sie ueber die Erfuellung des
unmittelbaren UEberlebenszwecks hinaus praktische Richtlinien des
Handelns und damit Gemeinsamkeit und UEbereinkunft implizierten.
Diese UEbereinkunft, die gemeinsame Teilhabe am Zeichen, ist dessen
eigentliches Merkmal, besonders in der Sprache.

Werkzeuge, Hoehlenbilder, primitive Notationsformen und Rituale
richteten sich auf ein kollektives Gedaechtnis, wie begrenzt auch
immer das Kollektive gewesen sein mag.  Woerter richteten sich an ein
individuelles Gedaechtnis und boten die Moeglichkeit individueller
Differenzierung.  Individuelle Beduerfnisse und Antriebe muessen in
Beziehung zu denen der sozialen Gruppe gesetzt werden.  Zeichen und
Werkzeuge sind Elemente, die in die Differenzierung mit einbezogen
wurden.  Ein Blick auf die gegenwaertige Erforschung kognitiver
Prozesse und deren Kategorien der verteilten und zentralen Autoritaet
kann das Zusammenspiel zwischen beiden erhellen.  Werkzeuge weisen
alle Merkmale der Verteilung auf.  Sie werden durch individuelle und
gemeinsame Verwendung immer wieder getestet und verbessert.  Zeichen
als Ergebnis menschlicher Interaktion sind alles andere als
individueller Natur.  Wir muessen sie daher mit den Anfaengen einer
zentralisierten Autoritaet in Verbindung bringen.  Diese UEberlegung
ist natuerlich eine konzeptuelle Hypothese ueber eine Wirklichkeit, zu
der wir anders keinen Zugang finden.  Doch ohne eine solche Hypothese
waeren weitere Schlussfolgerungen sinnlos.

Aus dem bisher Gesagten ergeben sich drei Stadien, die wir vor einer
naeheren Betrachtung der Sprache abhandeln muessen:
1. die Integration in der sozialen Gruppe durch unmittelbare Formen
der Interaktion wie Beruehrung, Austausch von Gegenstaenden, Erkennen
bzw.  Wiedererkennen ueber Geraeusche und Gesten sowie die Befriedigung
von Instinkten;
2. die Bewusstmachung von Unterschieden und AEhnlichkeiten auf
unmittelbarem Weg wie Vergleichen durch Gegenueberstellung,
Gleichmachung durch physische Anpassung;
3. Stabilisierung der Ausdrucksformen fuer Gleichheit oder
Unterschied durch Einbeziehung in das praktische Handeln.
Von dem Augenblick an, in dem gleich und anders auf einer
allgemeinen Ebene behandelt wurden, verloren sich die Empfindungen
und Lebensformen der Direktheit und Unmittelbarkeit.  Vielfaeltige
Schichten des Verstehens und Regeln fuer die Formung kohaerenter
Ausdrucksmittel wurden angesammelt, an zahllosen konkreten
Situationen ueberprueft, mit bereits verwendeten Zeichen (Gegenstaende,
Geraeusche, Gesten, Farben usw.) verknuepft und von dem Beduerfnis
eindeutiger Bedeutung losgeloest.  Alle diese Ausdrucksmittel wurden
im Prozess der Produktion (dem Herstellen von Gegenstaenden und
Kunstwerken, beim Jagen, Fischen, Pfluegen usw.) und
Selbstreproduktion sozialisiert, bis sie sich schliesslich zu einer
Sprache formten.  Und nachdem sie einmal zur Sprache geworden
waren--also zu Dingen und Handlungen, ueber die gesprochen
wurde--loeste sich diese Sprache von den Gegenstaenden und den
Produktionsvorgaengen.  Durch diese Losloesung aber erschien sie
zunehmend als etwas Gegebenes, als eine Einheit per se, eine
Wirklichkeit, die man fuerchten oder geniessen, die man verwenden
konnte, etwa zum Vergleich seiner eigenen Handlungen mit denen
anderer.  Dieser Entfaltungsprozess beanspruchte eine sehr lange
Zeit--einige hunderttausend Jahre.  Er verlief vermutlich simultan
mit der Herausbildung eines groesseren Gehirns und des aufrechten Gangs.

Doch zurueck zur Rolle des Gesprochenen (vor der Entstehung von
Notationssystemen und der Schrift) und seiner kulturellen Funktion im
Leben menschlicher Gemeinschaften.  Die vor der Entwicklung des
Wortes liegende Form des Gedaechtnisses beinhaltete Handlungsmuster,
Gesten, Geraeusche, Gerueche und geschaffene Gegenstaende.  Die
Strukturierung des Lebens war von aussen vorgegeben--natuerliche
Rhythmen (der Tages- und Jahreszeiten und des Alterns) und die
natuerliche Umwelt (Flusslandschaft, Gebirgslandschaft, Taeler,
Waldgbiete, Grasebenen).  Die Aussenwelt lieferte gewissermassen das
Stichwort, auf das hin die Teilnehmer reagierten und ihre Rolle
spielten.  Oder sie reagierten auf Stichwoerter, die ihnen die
vorausgegangene Erfahrung vorgab, welche durch direkte UEberlieferung
von einem zum anderen tradiert wurde.  Lange vor der Astrologie
bestimmte die Geomantik die Art und Weise, wie die Menschen ihre
Umwelt lasen und daraufhin verschiedene Glyphen (Petroglyphen,
Geoglyphen) ausbildeten.  Anfaenglich bezog sich die Erinnerung auf
einen Ort, spaeter auf Handlungsabfolgen.  Erst mit der Sprache
entwickelte sich die Zeitvorstellung.  Das Erinnern war nur minimal
durch den Instinkt veranlasst und seiner Natur nach kaum genetisch
bedingt.  Mit der Herausbildung des Wortes, welches zugleich auch die
Mittel fuer das Erkennen und schliesslich das Aufzeichnen von Woertern
beinhaltete, trat eine fundamentale AEnderung ein.  Das Wort bot der
menschlichen Erfahrungswelt ein Zeichen fuer Beziehungen an, war ein
relationales Zeichen.  Es brachte Objekt und Handlung zusammen.
Gemeinsam mit den Werkzeugen schuf es Kultur, verstanden als Einheit
von dem, was wir sind (Identitaet), was unsere Welt ist (Gegenstand
der Arbeit, der Betrachtung und des Nachdenkens) und was wir tun (um
zu ueberleben, uns fortzupflanzen und zu veraendern).  Dieser
Entwicklungsschritt zu einer menschlichen Kultur und dem Bewusstsein
von ihr wirkte sich entscheidend auf die praktischen Erfahrungen der
Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen aus.  Gleichzeitig vollzog sich
eine wichtige Spaltung: das genetische Gedaechtnis blieb fuer die
biologische Realitaet des Menschen verantwortlich, das soziale
Gedaechtnis uebernahm diese Aufgabe fuer die menschliche Kultur.
Gleichwohl existiert keines der beiden unabhaengig vom anderen.

Die jeweilige Natur dieser gegenseitigen Abhaengigkeit ist dabei
charakteristisch fuer die jeweiligen Veraenderungen in der Skala des
Menschen, die uns hier interessiert.  Selbst wenn wir beschreiben
koennten, welche Voraussetzungen noetig sind, damit die Menschen sich
zu Gemeinschaften zusammenschliessen koennen, was sie wissen und
verstehen muessen, um jagen, sammeln, Viehzucht und Landwirtschaft
betreiben zu koennen, dann wuessten wir noch lange nicht, wie gut sie
all dies ausfuehren muessten.  Rueckblickend sieht es so aus, als habe es
fuer die Entwicklung aus den primitiven Stadien der Menschheit zu dem,
was wir sind, einen vorbestimmten Weg gegeben.  Auch wenn wir von
einem solchen Weg ausgehen, wissen wir noch immer nicht, zu welchem
Zeitpunkt ein bestimmter Handlungstypus den UEberlebenserwartungen
nicht mehr genuegte und daher andere Wege erprobt werden mussten.  Wenn
wir indes das Konzept der Skala in unser Erklaerungsmodell einbauen,
koennen wir nicht nur die Phaenomene der Muendlichkeit und
Schriftlichkeit besser verstehen, sondern auch den Prozess, der zur
Schriftkultur und schliesslich zu einem Stadium jenseits der
Schriftkultur fuehrte.


Kulturelles Gedaechtnis

Das Gedaechtnis verdient unsere naehere Aufmerksamkeit, und zwar in
seinen fruehen Ausformungen (vergleichbar mit dem Gedaechtnis der
Kindheit, am Anfang der menschlichen Kultur) wie auch mit seinen
neuen Funktionen in unserer Zeit.  Wir duerfen mit einiger Sicherheit
annehmen, dass vor dem Wirken des kulturellen Gedaechtnisses das
genetische Gedaechtnis (in Form des genetischen Kodes, der inneren Uhr
und homoeostatischer Mechanismen) die Vererbungsmechanismen beherrscht
hat, die das UEberleben, die Fortpflanzung und die soziale Interaktion
regeln.  Mit dem Aufkommen des Wortes verlagerte sich das Gewicht von
der Vererbung auf die Vermittlung.  Es veraenderten sich die Rituale;
sie integrierten die Sprache und gewannen einen neuen Status als
synkretistische Projektion der Lebensgemeinschaft.  Mithilfe der
Sprache konnten effiziente Handlungswege beschrieben werden.  Auch
liessen sich allgemeine Programme fuer die verschiedensten Aktivitaeten
formulieren, fuer Schiffahrt, Jagd, die Unterhaltung von Feuerstellen
und die Herstellung von Werkzeugen.  Sprache vollzog sich in einem
Allgemeinheitsgrad, der weder der direkten Handlung noch dem Ritual
moeglich war.

In den Bildern, die den Woertern vorausgingen, folgten Gedanke und
Handlung einer Kreisstruktur: das eine war in das andere eingebettet.
Die Kreisrelation entsprach der begrenzten Skala der sich
konstituierenden Spezies: kein Wachstum, ein ausbalanciertes
Verhaeltnis von Input und Output.  Dieser zirkulaere Rahmen entsprach
der Identitaet, die zwischen dem Ergebnis einer Bemuehung und der dafuer
aufgewendeten Muehe bestand.  Jagen und Fallenstellen erforderten
grosse physische Anstrengung.  Der Lohn bestand allein darin, dass der
Hunger gestillt wurde.  Dividieren wir das Ergebnis durch die
aufgewendete Leistung, dann liefert uns das Ergebnis eine sehr
intuitive Darstellung von Effizienz oder Nutzen: in diesem zirkulaeren
Stadium stehen die beiden Variablen noch dicht beieinander, in einem
Verhaeltnis von etwa 1:1.

Der Rahmen der linearen Relationen ergab sich, als man sich der
Moeglichkeiten bewusst wurde, die aufgewendete Leistung zu reduzieren
und den erzielten Nutzen zu erhoehen.  Lineare Handlungsfolgen waren
deterministisch miteinander verknuepft--je kraeftiger der Mensch, desto
staerker beim Werfen, Stossen und Ziehen; je laenger die Beine, desto
schneller der Lauf.  Sprache entstand, als sich der zirkulaere Rahmen
veraenderte; gleichzeitig wurde sie zu einem wirkmaechtigen Faktor bei
der dynamischen Fortentwicklung auf landwirtschaftliche Arbeits- und
Lebensformen hin.  Mit der Sprache wurde die Kreisstruktur
aufgebrochen, Sequenzen wurden moeglich, und der einmal erreichte
Allgemeinheitsgrad schuf weitere Ebenen der Verallgemeinerung.  In
der Entwicklung von der durch Instinkt und biologische Rhythmen
koordinierten direkten Interaktion ueber eine durch melodische
Geraeusche, Bewegung und Feuerzeichen koordinierte Interaktion hin zu
einer auf Woertern basierenden Kommunikation fand die Spezies Mensch
zu ihrer Identitaet in Bezug auf andere Spezies.  Zugleich erfuhr sie
Kategorien wie Zweck und Fortschritt.

Im Mythos drueckt sich ein pragmatischer Handlungsrahmen aus, der
durch Progression gekennzeichnet ist.  Dieser Rahmen erstreckt sich
bis in unsere Zeit, in Formen, die der menschlichen
Skala--Progression von Stammesorganisation zur polis, den Staedten der
Antike--und ihren Aktivitaeten entspricht.  In der heutigen
Begrifflichkeit waeren Mythen Algorithmen des praktischen Lebens.  Im
Ritual konnten die zentralen Erfahrungen wie Geburt, Partnerwahl,
Geschlechtsbeziehung--allesamt bezogen auf Fortpflanzung und
Tod--innerhalb der Zirkularitaet von Aktion und Reaktion ausgedrueckt
werden.  Im Mythos vermittelt die Sprache eine relativ unpersoenliche
Erfahrung, die allen und jedem zugaenglich ist.  In ihrer durch
Sprache objektivierten Form nahm diese Erfahrung den Charakter von
Richtlinien an.  Sprache ist ein Hort der Erinnerung, aber auch ein
Mechanismus des Vergessens oder Vergessen-Machens, wenn sich neue
Umstaende fuer die Arbeit und das gesellschaftliche Leben ergeben.
Veraenderte Erfahrungen spiegelten sich in allem, was bezueglich dieser
Erfahrungen in der Sprache aufgehoben war.  Haeufig wurden im Akt der
Erfahrungsvermittlung Einzelheiten veraendert und Mythen umgeformt.
Daraus entstanden neue Programme fuer neue Zielsetzungen und neue
Arbeitsbedingungen.

Die Herausbildung und kulturelle Festigung der Sprache einerseits und
die Statusveraenderung des Menschen vom Homo Faber (dem Verwender von
Werkzeugen) zum Homo Sapiens (dem denkenden Wesen) andererseits
entwickelten sich im Rahmen der linearen Beziehungen von Aktion und
Ergebnis parallel.  Die Notwendigkeit, die Inhalte einer
mannigfaltigeren, indirekten und vermittelten Erfahrung zu
beschreiben, zu kategorisieren, aufzubewahren und weiterzugeben wurde
in die Sprachwirklichkeit hineinprojiziert.  Die Bedeutung der
Erfahrung fuer die Loesung eines vorliegenden Problems wurde ersetzt
durch die antizipierende Strukturierung zukuenftiger Aufgaben mit dem
Ziel, die aufzubringende Leistung zu minimieren und das Ergebnis zu
maximieren.


Existenzrahmen

Muendlichkeit konnte vergangene Vorgaenge kaum darstellen.  Woerter, die
in einem unendlichen Jetzt--der impliziten Vorstellung von
Gegenwaertigkeit--eingebunden sind, erfinden offenbar die
Vergangenheit je nach den unmittelbaren Beduerfnissen immer wieder neu.
Im muendlichen Stadium der Sprache war die Vergangenheit eine
spezifische Form der Gegenwart genau wie die Zukunft, da die Sprache
ueber keine Moeglichkeiten verfuegte, das Wort auf eine Zeitachse zu
projizieren.

Muendlichkeit ist daher an festgelegte Existenz- und Lebensrahmen
gebunden.  Die Kultur des geschriebenen Wortes ergab sich aus einem
variablen Existenzrahmen, innerhalb dessen ein neuer pragmatischer
Handlungsraum und die wachsende Skala menschlicher Taetigkeit stabile
Sprachkonturen erforderten.  Wenngleich ueber jeweils kuerzere
Zeitspannen ein solcher Sprachentwurf als fixierter Bezugsrahmen
erscheint, bringt er doch grundsaetzlich eine mobile, dynamische
Lebenspraxis zum Ausdruck, deren Ertrag sich aus der Dynamik linearer
Beziehungen ergibt.  Arbeit und soziale Interaktion, also die
pragmatische Dimension des menschlichen Daseins, erforderten die
Aufzeichnung der Sprache und praegten deren Linearitaet.

Hinter der ueber 3500 Jahre alten Keilschrift stehen Sumerer, die beim
Betrachten des Nachthimmels einen Loewen, einen Stier und einen
Skorpion erkannten.  Sie zeigt zugleich, wie die praktische Erfahrung
als kognitiver Filter fungiert: wie sie die Betrachtung unbekannter
Phaenomene beeinflusst, fuer die es keine Begriffe gibt, und wie sie
auseinanderliegende Welten--die irdische Welt und den Himmel--in
diesem Stadium der Sprachentwicklung aufeinander bezieht.  Dies ist
umso bemerkenswerter, als das Sumerische als isolierte Sprache nur in
schriftlicher Form ueberliefert ist--ein Produkt jener kulturellen
Hochbluete im Suedwesten Asiens, wo viele Sprachfamilien ihren Ursprung
haben.

Schrift ist auf einer hoeheren kognitiven Ebene angesiedelt als die
Artikulation des Wortes oder die Notierung von Piktogrammen.  Sie ist
ein vielfaeltiges Beziehungsgefuege, das Relationen zwischen Woertern,
zwischen Saetzen und zwischen Bild und Sprache ermoeglicht.  Auch die
Schrift brachte von Anfang an auseinanderliegende Welten in Beziehung,
aber auf einer anderen Ebene als die sumerische Keilschrift.
Schrift ermoeglicht und erfordert geradezu eine weitere Sprachebene,
den Text: eine Einheit, deren einzelne Teile ihre individuelle
Bedeutung verlieren und als Ganzes eine Botschaft darstellen oder
Bedeutung hervorbringen.  Die Erfahrung, die man in bildlichen
Darstellungen, in Zeichnungen, Felsgravierungen und Holzschnitten,
gemacht hatte, wurde auf das geschriebene Wort uebertragen.

Bildzeichen stellten eine komplexe Notationsform dar mit zahlreichen
Komponenten--einige sichtbar (das Schriftbild), andere unsichtbar
(die Phonetik)--und wenigen Kombinationsregeln.  Bildzeichen sind
durchaus in Zeichenfolgen angeordnet; diese erzaehlen von Ereignissen
oder Handlungen in ihrem natuerlichen Ablauf.  Was in der Zeichenfolge
zuerst erscheint, geht allem anderen tatsaechlich (zeitlich) voraus
oder nimmt in einer Hierarchie einen hoeheren Platz ein.  Die
Beziehung zwischen Mann und Frau, zwischen freien Individuen und
Sklaven sowie zwischen Eigenem und Fremdem wurde auf diese Weise
verankert.  Selbst die Schriftrichtung (von links nach rechts, rechts
nach links oder oben nach unten) liefert Aufschluesse ueber die
Menschen, die ihre Identitaet ausdruecken, indem sie Buchstaben in
Tafeln einritzen oder sie auf Pergament malen.  Die konkreten
Piktogramme erlaubten keine Verallgemeinerungen.  Die Ausdruckskraft
war hoch, Praezision indes praktisch unmoeglich.

Eine ausfuehrliche Geschichte der Schrift beansprucht viele Kapitel in
einer Geschichte der Sprache.  Sie ist zugleich eine hilfreiche
Einfuehrung in die Wissensgeschichte, in die AEsthetik und vermutlich
die Kognitionswissenschaft.  In der Geschichte der Schrift erkennen
wir ferner die Prozesse, die zu den Anfaengen von Schriftkultur und
darauf basierender Bildung fuehrten.Vermutlich liegen zwischen den
Hoehlenmalereien und Steingravierungen und den ersten bekundeten
Schriftversuchen mehr als 30000 Jahre.  Aus der Perspektive der
Schriftkultur beinhaltet dieser Zeitraum die Losloesung des Menschen
vom Bildlich-Konkreten und die Einrichtung einer Welt aus
Konventionen und gezielter Verschriftlichung.  Abstraktes Denken ist
ohne die kognitive Unterstuetzung durch abstrakte Darstellungen und
die darin (teils implizit) enthaltenen UEbereinkuenfte und Konventionen
nicht moeglich.  Die keilfoermigen Zeichen der Sumerer, die
Zeremonialschrift der aegyptischen Hieroglyphen, die chinesischen
Ideogramme, das hebraeische, griechische und roemische Alphabet--ihnen
allen ist die Tendenz gemeinsam, die Konkretheit von Erfahrung und
Mitteilung zu ueberwinden.  Sie bieten ein abstraktes Zeichensystem,
aus dem sich immer komplexere Sprachen entwickeln konnten.

Bis zur Entwicklung der Schrift blieb die Sprache eng an ihre
Benutzer gebunden--an Stimme, Blick, Gehoer und Beruehrung.  Die
Schrift objektivierte die Sprache und loeste sie vom Subjekt und von
der Sinneswahrnehmung.  Die Entwicklung zur geschriebenen Sprache und
von dort zu einer zunaechst begrenzten, schliesslich allgemein
verbreiteten Schriftkultur begleitet die Evolution des Menschen von
einem Stadium unmittelbarer Beduerfnisbefriedigung (Kreisrelation) zu
einem Stadium, in dem sich Ansprueche mittelbarer Art vermehrt
einstellten (Linearfunktion).  Der Unterschied zwischen
Grundbeduerfnissen des UEberlebens und den darueber hinausgehenden
Beduerfnissen des Sozialstatus (Macht, Ego, Furcht, Freude, fruehe
Stadien des Bewusstseins und der Sinngebung ) ist in der Sprache
ausgedrueckt, die wir ihrerseits wiederum als Teil der
fortschreitenden Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen in einem
bestimmten pragmatischen Zusammenhang begreifen muessen.


Entfremdung von der Unmittelbarkeit

Unter Entfremdung verstehen wir ganz allgemein jenen Prozess, der uns
einen Teil unserer selbst (unseres Koerpers, unserer Gedanken, Arbeit,
Gefuehle, UEberzeugungen) als fremd erscheinen laesst.  Wenn wir die
Erklaerung dieses bedeutsamen Prozesses (und des Begriffes, der ihn
sprachlich darstellt) in die Entstehungs- und Verwendungsgeschichte
von Zeichen einbinden, koennen wir seine pragmatischen Implikationen
besser verstehen.

Zeichen wahrzunehmen heisst den Unterschied wahrnehmen zwischen dem,
was wir sind, und der Art, wie wir unsere Identitaet ausdruecken.  Wenn
Zeichen irgendeinen Gegenstand darstellen (die Zeichnung eines
Gegenstandes oder einer Person, Name, Versicherungsnummer,
Personalausweis usw.), dann ist der Unterschied zwischen dem, was
dargestellt ist, und seiner Darstellungsform eine Frage der
Angemessenheit (warum nennen wir einen Tisch Tisch oder eine
bestimmte Frau Maria) und der Entfremdung.  Der bewusste Gebrauch von
Zeichen ergibt sich vermutlich aus der Erkenntnis, dass Gedanken,
Gefuehle oder Fragen fast immer ungenuegend ausgedrueckt werden.  Zwei
Dinge geschehen, und zwar vermutlich gleichzeitig:
1. Wenn nicht mehr der direkte Umgang mit einem Gegenstand oder
einer geplanten Handlung, sondern mit dessen Darstellung gegeben ist,
wird es schwieriger, die mit dem Gegenstand verbundenen Erfahrungen
mit anderen zu teilen.
2. Da sich auch die vorzunehmende Interpretation vom Objekt auf
dessen Darstellung verlagert, stellen sich neuartige Erfahrungen und
Assoziationen ein, die teils verwirrend, teils anregend sein koennen.
Das Bild war noch nahe am Gegenstand; Verwirrung stellte sich
hinsichtlich der Handlungsanweisung ein.  Die Schrift ist vom
Gegenstand weit entfernt, wohingegen Handlungen wegen der zeitlichen
Differenzierungsmoeglichkeiten besser beschrieben werden koennen.
Mittlerweile wissen wir, dass sich laufende Bilder oder Photoserien
der darzustellenden Handlung zu diesem Zweck noch besser eignen.

Mit dem geschriebenen Wort koennen Ereignisse berichtet werden.
Ferner koennen Beziehungen und gegenseitge Verpflichtungen unter den
Mitgliedern einer Lebensgemeinschaft dargestellt werden.  Normen
koennen errichtet und auferlegt werden.  Insgesamt schlaegt sich in der
Schrift eine fundamentale Veraenderung nieder, die sich aus der
erhoehten Produktivitaet der gerade erst sesshaft gewordenen
Gemeinschaften ergab.  Es geht nicht mehr vornehmlich um Arbeit, um
leben (d. h. ueberleben) zu koennen, sondern um das Leben, welches der
Arbeit gewidmet ist.  Die Schrift entfremdet mehr als alle vorher
gebraeuchlichen Zeichen die Menschen von ihrer Umwelt und von sich
selbst.  Einige Gefuehle (Freude, Trauer) und Haltungen (AErger,
Misstrauen) werden selbst zu Zeichen und koennen, einmal ausgedrueckt,
niedergeschrieben werden (in Briefen, Testamenten).  Auch die
Gedanken durchlaufen, um von anderen geteilt werden zu koennen, diesen
Prozess, wie ueberhaupt alles, was auf Leben, Tun, Veraenderung,
Krankheit, Liebe und Tod bezogen ist.

Dass Schrift und Sesshaftigkeit des Menschen zusammenzusehen sind,
haben wir schon festgestellt.  Dasselbe gilt fuer das Verhaeltnis der
Schrift zum Warentausch und zu dem, was spaeter Arbeitsteilung heisst.
Waehrend naemlich der muendliche Gebrauch von Sprache die
Differenzierung der Lebenspraxis ermoeglicht, bringt die Verwendung
der Schrift die Teilung zwischen koerperlicher und nichtkoerperlicher
Arbeit mit sich.  Das Schreiben erfordert bestimmte Fertigkeiten, zum
Beispiel fuer die Bedienung von Schneidnadel oder Griffel, spaeter fuer
die Kunst der Kalligraphie.  Zwischen der Faehigkeit zu schreiben und
der Faehigkeit, Felle zu gerben, Fleisch, landwirtschaftliche Produkte
und Rohstoffe zu verarbeiten, besteht ein grosser Unterschied.  Der
gesellschaftliche Status von Schreibern belegt, dass dieser
Unterschied genuegend anerkannt wurde.  Und wir sollten nicht
vergessen, dass die wenigen, die das Schreiben beherrschten, zugleich
diejenigen waren, die lesen konnten.  Dennoch belegen einige
historische Quellen eher das Gegenteil: im 13. Jahrhundert wurden
Schreiber bevorzugt, die des Lesens unkundig waren, weil das
ungestoerte Abschreiben genauer war.  Ganz aehnliches finden wir heute
bei den des Englischen unkundigen Operatoren, die angesammelte
Datenkorpora auf digitale Datentraeger uebertragen muessen.  Waehrend die
Zahl der Lesekundigen staendig anstieg, blieb die Zahl der
Schreibenden, die sich den wirklichen Schriftstellern als Schreiber
zur Verfuegung stellten, jahrhundertelang begrenzt.

Schriftlichkeit begann in primitiven Volkswirtschaften als
overhead-Aufwand einer Elite, entwickelte sich zu einer elitaeren
Beschaeftigung, die von Vorurteilen und Aberglauben umrankt war,
weitete sich aus, nachdem (rudimentaerer) technologischer Fortschritt
ihre Verbreitung ermoeglicht hatte, und erwies sich schliesslich im
Industriezeitalter als Voraussetzung fuer gesteigerte Effizienz.
Primitiver Tauschhandel kam ohne das geschriebene Wort aus, obgleich
er fortbestand, auch nachdem sich geschriebene Sprache ihren festen
Platz gesichert hatte.

Die vom Tauschhandel bedingte Form der Entfremdung unterscheidet sich
wesentlich von jener, die von einem auf der Vermittlung des
geschriebenen Wortes basierenden Markt ausgeht.  Mit anderen Worten:
Tausch ist etwas grundsaetzlich anderes als Kauf und Verkauf.  Die an
den Tauschhandel gebundenen Produkte tragen den persoenlichen Stempel
derer, die sie im Schweisse ihres Angesichts produziert haben.  Zum
Verkauf stehende Produkte werden unpersoenlich; ihre Identitaet ist
einzig das Beduerfnis, das sie stillen oder bisweilen hervorrufen.
Der Mythos als ein Satz von praktischen Programmen fuer eine kleinere
Zahl raeumlich begrenzter Erfahrungen wurde den Erfordernissen einer
Gemeinschaft, die ihre Erfahrungen ausweitete und mit fremden
Gemeinschaften interagierte, nicht mehr gerecht.  Dem Unterschied
zwischen den Marktformen, fuer die entweder Muendlichkeit oder eine
fruehe Form von Schriftlichkeit charakteristisch ist, entspricht der
Unterschied zwischen einem muendlich ueberlieferten Mythos und einer
ausgearbeiteten Mythologie, die an die Schrifterfahrung gebunden ist.
Sprache in schriftlicher Form erwies sich als soziales Gedaechtnis
sui generis, als potentielle Geschichte.

Das starke Interesse an genealogischen Abfolgen (in China, Indien,
AEgypten, bei den Hebraeern und in nahezu allen muendlichen Kulturen)
verraet ein Interesse am Zusammenhang und Ablauf menschlicher
Entwicklungen, die in einem Gedaechtnis mit sozialen Dimensionen zu
bewahren sind.  Auch drueckt sich darin ein Interesse an der Dimension
der Zeit aus, denn jede genealogische Abfolge ist ein historisches
Dokument ueber Menschen, Handlungen, Folgen und Veraenderungen.  In
muendlichen Kulturen dienten Genealogien auch als Erinnerungstechniken,
konnten neuen Lebensbedingungen angepasst und so neben einem Dokument
der Vergangenheit auch zu einer Anweisung fuer die Zukunft werden.
Anfaenglich griffen die genealogischen Aufzeichnungen noch stark auf
Bildmaterial (Stammbaum) und auf das gesprochene Wort zurueck und
hielten sich damit die Variabilitaet des Muendlichen offen.  Gleichwohl
boten die Strukturen der Schriftsprache neue Moeglichkeiten des
gesicherten Ausdrucks, der Aufbewahrung, Uniformitaet und des
logischen Zusammenhangs.  Sie entwickelten sich aus den ersten
Versuchen, Gedanken und Begriffe zu formulieren, was schliesslich zu
dem fuehrte, was wir unter theoria verstehen--die reflektierende
Betrachtung von Dingen und ihre Umsetzung in Sprache.  Diese wiederum
schufen die Grundlage fuer die Natur- und Geisteswissenschaften von
gestern, zum Teil auch noch von heute.  In gewisser Hinsicht sind
auch Theorien Genealogien, mit einer Wurzel und mit Zweigen, die die
Hypothesen und verschiedenen Schlussfolgerungen darstellen.  Die
geschriebene Sprache sicherte die Dauerhaftigkeit der historischen
Dokumente (Genealogien, Besitzverhaeltnisse, Theorien) und
erleichterte zugleich ueber relativ uniforme Kodes den Zugang dazu.

In den Stadtstaaten des antiken Griechenland wurden sich indes
diejenigen, die an die begrenzte Praxis der Muendlichkeit gebunden
blieben, der Gefahren bewusst, die ein neuer Ausdrucks- und
Kommunikationsmechanismus mit sich brachte.  Die Schrift wies ihre
eigenen Formen der Ungenauigkeit auf, sei es aufgrund eines bewussten
Verhaeltnisses gegenueber einer bestimmten Erfahrung, sei es durch den
Wunsch, Zusammenhanglosigkeit zu vermeiden: beides wirkte sich
jedenfalls auf die Darstellung der Tatsachen aus.  Tatsachen sind,
wie wir alle wissen, nicht zwangslaeufig zusammenhaengend.  Daher
wenden wir alle nur denkbaren Strategien auf, sie aufeinander
auszurichten, selbst dann, wenn sie zusammenhanglos sind.  In der
muendlichen Kommunikation wird Zusammenhang dadurch hergestellt, dass
man sich unaufhoerlich auf den Verlauf des Gespraechs einstellt.  Hier
gibt es eine direkte Form der Kritik, d. h. eine selbstregulierende
Funktion des Gespraechs.  Mithin bedeuten Vollstaendigkeit und
Zusammenhang im (offenen) Gespraech und im geschriebenen Text etwas
anderes, und im uebrigen etwas wiederum anderes in formalen Sprachen.

Auch das Gedaechtnis stand zur Debatte.  Als ein alternatives Medium
der Bewahrung und Tradierung liess auch die Schrift Auswirkungen auf
das kollektive Gedaechtnis befuerchten--auf jenen Speicher von
Tradition und Identitaet, ueber den ein Volk im Zeitalter der
Muendlichkeit verfuegte.  Schrift besitzt einen anderen Ausdruckswert
als das Muendliche und hinterlaesst einen anderen Eindruck.  Und dadurch,
dass die Schrift nur den Lesekundigen zugaenglich ist, wirkt sie sich
auf Aufbau und Verfuegbarkeit des gemeinsamen Wissensbestandes aus.
Gesprochene Worte sind die Worte dessen, der sie aeussert.  Ein
geschriebener Text nimmt ein Eigenleben an und erscheint als etwas
von aussen Kommendes, Fremdes.  Geschriebenes ist vorgegeben und
nivelliert Unterschiede zwischen den Individuen; Gesprochenes kann
der Situation angepasst oder veraendert werden, die Kohaerenz haengt vom
Dialogverlauf ab.  Noch heute gibt es Volks- oder
Stammesgemeinschaften (die Netsidik, Nuer oder Bassari, um nur einige
zu nennen), die das Gesprochene dem Geschriebenen vorziehen.  In
ihrer Lebenspraxis teilt der leibhaftige Ausdruck eines Menschen, der
seine Worte in Gegenwart anderer aeussert, mehr an Informationen mit,
als es dieselben Worte in schriftlicher Form tun koennten.

Das kollektive Gedaechtnis einer Schriftkultur verliert den Bezug zur
unmittelbaren Erfahrung und wird zu einem Speicher der vielfaeltigen
Vermittlungen im sozialen Leben einer Gemeinschaft.  Das, was gesagt
wird (legomena), unterscheidet sich von dem, was getan wird (dromena).
Das geschriebene Wort bezieht sich auf andere Woerter, nicht auf das,
was getan wird.  Das Gleiche gilt fuer den Satz, wenn er den Status
einer relativ vollstaendigen Spracheinheit besitzt.  Die wirkliche
Veraenderung vollzog sich durch das Geschriebene, auf Papyrus, Ton,
Pergament oder Schiefertafel, auf Stein oder Blei.  Eine solche Seite
ist auf andere Seiten bezogen und letztlich auf alles Geschriebene.
Das tatsaechliche Tun verschwindet aus der Geschichte; diese wird zu
einer Sammlung von Schriftstuecken, sauber auf Buchregalen
zusammengetragen.  Die Bedeutung der Geschichte drueckt sich aus in
der Variabilitaet der Beziehungen, die zwischen den einzelnen Texten
bestehen.  Wenn das Hier und Jetzt der dromena verloren ist, bleibt
uns nur das Bewusstsein von Abfolgen.  Das ist ein Gewinn, aber auch
ein Verlust: die holistische Bedeutung der Erfahrung ist verloren
gegangen.

Wie relevant der in dieser Kritik betonte Gegensatz zwischen
Muendlichkeit und Schriftlichkeit fuer die Phaenomene unserer Zeit ist,
bedarf einer ausfuehrlicheren Eroerterung.  Seit der Zeit, in der die
erwaehnte Kritik an der Schriftlichkeit geaeussert wurde, hat sich die
Sprache so sehr veraendert, dass wir die Texte jener Zeit nur in
kommentierten UEbersetzungen lesen koennen.  Einige davon mussten aus
Texten einer spaeteren Zeit (d. h. eines anderen pragmatischen
Lebenszusammenhangs) oder aus UEbersetzungen rekonstruiert werden.
Zwischen der Schriftkultur aus den Anfaengen der Schrift und der
automatischen Lektuere und Textverarbeitung besteht keine unmittelbare
Beziehung.  Fuer einige dieser Texte muessen wir einen Kontextbezug
erstellen, ohne den grosse Teile dieser Texte gar nicht verstaendlich
waeren.  Selbst das geschriebene Wort ist von dem Kontext abhaengig, in
dem es verwendet wurde.  Obwohl also die geschriebene Sprache
scheinbar weniger lebendig und weniger einem Wandel unterworfen ist
als das Gespraech, veraendert sie sich.  Heute schreiben wir mithilfe
von Textverarbeitungstechnologien, die sich von allen anderen Formen
des Schreibens unterscheiden.

Wir koennen die Kritik aus der Zeit Platons nicht voellig von der Hand
weisen.  Im Medium der Schrift wurde manch eine menschliche Erfahrung
verdinglicht.  Sie ermoeglichte eine bestimmte extreme Form der
Subjektivitaet: Ohne Gespraech und ohne die darin moegliche Kritik wurde
Vergangenheit immer aufs Neue erfunden gemaess den Zielen und Werten
der jeweiligen Gegenwart, in die der Verfasser eingebettet war.  Im
sozialen Leben einer auf muendlicher Kommunikation beruhenden
Gesellschaft war die Meinung (griechisch doxa) das Ergebnis der
Sprache; diese musste unvermittelt sein.  In der Schrift wird Wahrheit
gesucht und bewahrt.  Die Heftigkeit, mit der sich Sokrates gegen die
Schrift verwahrte (jedenfalls in Platons Dialogen), erklaert sich aus
seiner Einsicht, dass man sich damit zunehmend von der Quelle des
Denkens entfernte und somit der untreuen Auslegung Raum gab.
Sokrates fuerchtete wie Platon die Indirektheit und verliess sich
allein auf Gedaechtnis und Weisheit.

So sorgt sich Platon bezueglich der Folgen des Schreibens: "Bedenklich
naemlich, mein Phaidros, ist darin das Schreiben und sehr verwandt der
Malerei.  Denn auch ihre Schoepfungen stehen da wie lebend,--doch
fragst du sie etwas, herrscht wuerdevolles Schweigen."  Als einer der
ersten Philosophen, die sich mit dem Schreiben auseinandersetzten,
konnte Platon noch nicht erkennen, dass es sich dabei nicht einfach
nur um eine Transkription von Gedanken handelte (also der Worte,
durch die und in denen Menschen denken), dass sich die Gedanken beim
Schreiben anders formen als beim Sprechen und dass es sich bei der
Schrift um ein qualitativ neues Zeichensystem handelt, das in seinem
Realitaetsbezug noch staerker vermittelt ist als das Reden.

Mit Blick auf unsere Gegenwart nun ist leicht zu erkennen, dass auch
heute das Gedaechtnis von entscheidender Bedeutung ist.
Schriftlichkeit erweist sich dabei als grosse Herausforderung
bezueglich der Zuverlaessigkeit des Gedaechtnisses.  Einerseits ist das
Gedaechtnis der Speicher jener Fakten, mit denen sich die Menschen in
der Arbeitswelt einrichten.  AErzte, Juristen, militaerische
Fuehrungskraefte, Lehrer, Krankenschwestern und Bueroangestellte greifen
dabei in staerkerem Mass auf das Gedaechtnis zurueck als vielleicht
Fabrikarbeiter am Fliessband.  Andererseits aber verringert sich mit
erhoehter Berufsqualifikation die Notwendigkeit, auf Schriftlichkeit
zurueckzugreifen, abgesehen von den anfaenglichen
Bildungsvoraussetzungen, die ueber Buecher erworben werden.  Video,
Tonband und Diskette, digitale Speicherung und Netzwerke haben die
Bedeutung der Schriftlichkeit fuer die Wissensvermittlung
eingeschraenkt.

Die Faktoren, die die Sprache notwendig haben entstehen lassen,
erklaeren auch ihre Geschichte und Eigenschaften.  Die Sprache
entstand aus einem allgemeinen Entwicklungsprozess heraus, in dem sich
der Mensch in die Praxis seines Daseins hineinprojizierte, zu seiner
natuerlichen und sozialen Identitaet fand und den Weg des linearen
Wachstums einschlug.  Das Stadium der Muendlichkeit legt dabei Zeugnis
ab fuer begrenzte, zirkulaere Erfahrungen und entspricht einer noch
nicht zur Sesshaftigkeit gefundenen Lebensform, in der der Mensch nach
Wohlergehen und Sicherheit strebte.  Sie beruhte weitgehend auf dem
lebendigen Gedaechtnis und schlug sich im Ritual nieder.  Schrift und
Schreiben entwickelten sich im Zusammenhang verschiedener
weitreichender Veraenderungen: eine ausdifferenzierte Lebenspraxis,
Sesshaftigkeit und ein ueber den Tauschhandel hinausgehender Warenmarkt,
wobei diese Faktoren sich gegenseitig beeinflussten.  Am Ende dieses
Prozesses stand die Trennung von geistiger und koerperlicher Arbeit.
Sprechen, Schreiben und Lesen--jene Eigenschaften der Schriftkultur,
die uns aus der Sicht unserer heutigen Schriftkulturen gelaeufig und
selbsverstaendlich sind--wurden durch diese Entwicklung logisch
moeglich.  Tatsaechlich war das Schreiben nicht unbedingt der Anfang
von Schriftkultur und Bildung, sondern stellte die Moeglichkeit zu
ihrer Herausbildung dar.  Ein Verstaendnis der Mechanismen der Sprache
und jener Sprachfunktionen, die mit der Entwicklung der Schrift ein
neues Entwicklungsstadium des Menschen eingeleitet hatten, wird uns
auch zu verstehen helfen, wie die Schrift zum spaeteren Ideal der
Schriftkultur und Bildung beitrug.



Kapitel 3:

Muendlichkeit und Schrift in unserer Zeit:
Was verstehen wir, wenn wir Sprache verstehen?

Wir sitzen vor dem Computer und sind mit dem World Wide Web verbunden.
Was liegt heute an?  Wie waer’s mit Neurochirurgie?  Irgendwo auf
dieser Welt fuehrt ein Neurochirurg gerade eine Operation durch.  Wir
koennen einzelne Neuronen auf unserem Monitor sehen.  Oder wir koennen
mitverfolgen, wie der Chirurg die Faehigkeit des Patienten ueberprueft,
bestimmte Muster zu erkennen, damit er eine Karte von den kognitiven
Funktionen des Gehirns zeichnen kann, die fuer den Erfolg der
Operation entscheidend ist.  Ab und an wird das Gespraech zwischen
Chirurg und Assistenten durch die Einspielung von Daten auf
verschiedenen Monitoren ergaenzt.  Verstehen wir die Sprache, die sie
sprechen?  Koennte ein schriftlicher Bericht ueber den Ablauf der
Operation ersetzen, was wir leibhaftig vor Augen haben?  Fuer einen
Studenten der Neurochirurgie oder einen Wissenschaftler wird sich die
Frage des Verstehens anders stellen als fuer einen Laien.

Nehmen wir ein anderes Beispiel.  Unter einer anderen Internetadresse
findet ein Konzert statt.  Bands aus aller Welt schicken ihre Musik
live an diese Adresse.  Die Zuhoerer koennen zwischen den zahllosen
gleichzeitig spielenden Bands auswaehlen.  Man singt von
Allerweltsthemen--Liebe, Hoffnung, Verstaendnis.  Und dennoch: selbst
wenn wir jedes Wort verstehen koennten, verstehen wir wirklich, was
sich da abspielt?

Anstelle des Internet koennte man eine Fabrik besuchen, eine Boerse
oder ein Kaufhaus.  Man koennte sich in der U-Bahn irgendeiner Stadt
wiederfinden, eine Schulklasse besuchen oder in einem Regierungsbuero
seinen Geschaeften nachgehen.  Diese Szenarien verkoerpern die
vielfaeltigen Formen menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung durch Arbeit.
Auf den ersten Blick sprechen alle die gleiche Sprache.  Aber wer
versteht was?  Einfacher gefragt: Was verstehen wir, wenn wir eine
Anweisung lesen oder beilaeufig oder offiziell ein Gespraech verfolgen?
Der gegebene Kontext ist die heutige Zeit, die sich von jeder
vorausgegangenen Zeit, vor allem aber von einer Lebenspraxis
unterscheidet, die auf Schriftkultur und Bildung gruendete.  Die
Antworten auf unsere Fragen sind nicht einfach.  Und die Grundlage
fuer die Behandlung solcher Fragen muss breiter sein als die wenigen
angefuehrten Beispiele.


Bestaetigung als Feedback

Das Verstehen der Sprache ist weit mehr als die gruendliche Kenntnis
von Vokabular und Grammatik.  Ohne Teilhabe an der Erfahrung jenseits
der Sprachaeusserung ist sprachliches Verstehen nicht moeglich.  Das,
was nicht zum Ausdruck gebracht wird, muss im Hoerer, Leser oder
Schreiber praesent sein.  Sprache muss durch die Laut- und Wortfolge,
die gehoert, gelesen oder geschrieben wird, das entstehen lassen, was
durch die wiedererkannten Woerter und die verwendete Grammatik nicht
unmittelbar ausgedrueckt wird.  Hinter jedem Wort, das wir verstehen,
steht eine gemeinsame praktische Erfahrung, ein gemeinsamer
pragmatischer Handlungsrahmen oder irgendeine rudimentaere Form
gemeinsamen Verstehens als Hintergrundswissen.  "Die Grenzen der
Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt," hat Wittgenstein gesagt.
Ich wuerde diese Feststellung neu formulieren und Wissen an Erfahrung
binden: Die Grenzen meiner Erfahrung sind die Grenzen meiner Welt.
Die Selbstkonstituierung durch Sprache ist Teil dieser Erfahrung.

Die erste Ebene der direkten Beziehung zwischen jemandem, der etwas
sprachlich ausdrueckt, und jemandem, der das Gesagte verstehen moechte,
laesst sich in eine einfache semantische Annahme bringen: Ich weiss, dass
du weisst."  Aber reicht dieses Wissen, um ein Gespraech erfolgreich
fortzufuehren?  Reicht es etwa in einem Gespraech ueber ein zu jagendes
Tier aus, wenn der Gespraechspartner weiss, um welches Tier es geht?
Viele Semantiker wuerden sich damit zufrieden geben.  Sie teilen die
von Chomsky getroffene Unterscheidung zwischen Sprachkompetenz
(competence) und Sprachverwendung (performance) und fuehren
Kommunikationsprobleme auf die Inkongruenz unserer individuellen
Lexika, und nicht auf die unterschiedlichen praktischen Erfahrungen
der Sprachbenutzer zurueck.  Zumindest theoretisch waere demnach die
kulturelle Kongruenz einer Sprachgemeinschaft durch umfassende Lexika
usw. herzustellen.  Heute wissen wir, dass die entstehende
Industriegesellschaft zwar eine gewisse Phase relativer kultureller
Kongruenz aufgrund einheitsstiftender Faktoren durchlaufen hat, diese
Kongruenz aber mit der Erweiterung der Skala menschlicher Erfahrungen
aufgehoben wurde.  Die eingangs des Kapitels gegebenen Beispiele
haben dies verdeutlicht.

Sprache wird also nicht einfach nur auf die Erfahrungswelt der
Menschen bezogen, sie wird in ihr und durch sie geschaffen.  Das ist
eine der Haupthesen des vorliegenden Buches.  Sprachverwendung geht
der Sprachkompetenz voraus.  Das Erkennen einer AEusserung oder eines
Satzes an sich ist bereits eine Erfahrung, durch die sich Individuen
definieren.  Innerhalb einer begrenzten Erfahrungsskala bewirkte die
Homogenitaet der Lebensumstaende eine kohaerente Sprachverwendung.  Mit
steigender Bevoelkerungszahl und diversifizierter Erfahrung loeste sich
der homogene pragmatische Bezugsrahmen auf, folglich gab es auch
keine kohaerente Sprachpraxis.  Die fortlaufende Diversifizierung der
praktischen Erfahrung fuehrte schliesslich dazu, dass Woerter und Saetze
mehrere und unterschiedliche Dinge gleichzeitig bedeuten konnten.
Die Festsetzung und Zuweisung von Bedeutung liegt stets in der
Erfahrung, durch die Individuen ihre Identitaet bilden.

Wenn wir die verschiedenen Elemente untersuchen, die den Status der
Schriftkultur in der heutigen Welt fragmentierter praktischer
Erfahrungen beeinflussen, erscheint Sprache in einem anderen Licht.
Aus dieser Perspektive koennen wir beurteilen, wie und wann durch
gleichfoermige Erfahrungen ein einheitlicher Rahmen fuer die
Schriftkultur moeglich und notwendig gemacht wurde.  Wir koennen
gleichzeitig sehen, von welchem Entwicklungspunkt an diese
Schriftkultur durch andere Formen der Literalitaet ergaenzt wurde und
wodurch, wenn ueberhaupt, diese Vielfalt verbunden werden koennte.  Die
beiden zu untersuchenden Stadien sind die der unmittelbaren und der
vermittelten Erfahrung.  Dabei ist jener Sprachstand von besonderem
Interesse, in dem Gesten, Laute und erste Wortgebilde die
unmittelbare Erfahrung beeinflussten.

Indirektheit beinhaltet, dass man sich gemeinsamer
Bezeichnungen--Geste, Laut, Wort--bewusst ist.  Die Gemeinsamkeit
schliesst die Erfahrung mit ein.  Auf dieser Ebene gibt es noch keine
Verallgemeinerung.  Handlungsmuster sind zugleich Muster der
Selbstkonstituierung: beim Jagen projiziert der Jaeger physische
Faehigkeiten.  In der Beziehung zu anderen Jaegern uebertraegt er
Faehigkeiten der Koordination, Planung und gegenseitigen Verstaendigung.
Dadurch wird eine Ebene der Indirektheit erreicht: die der
Rueckbestaetigung fuer alle biologischen Ablaeufe, in der Kybernetik
feedback genannt.  Das (stillschweigend vorausgesetzte) anfaengliche
"Ich weiss, dass du weisst", wird nun zu, "Ich weiss, dass du weisst, dass
ich weiss."  Damit kommen Fragen der Koordination und Hierarchie ins
Spiel.  Wollen wir in dieser Erfahrung gar den Anfang von Bedeutung
in der Sprache sehen, wird die Folge der stillschweigenden Annahmen
noch laenger: "Ich weiss, dass du weisst, dass ich weiss, dass du weisst."
Wir befinden uns damit auf einer kognitiven Ebene, die sich von
derjenigen der unmittelbaren praktischen Erfahrung voellig
unterscheidet.

Wir sehen, wie sich in unserer dreiteiligen Annahmensequenz Syntax
und Semantik gegenseitig bedingen und wie beide eingebettet sind in
die sie bedingende Lebenspraxis.  UEbertragen auf unsere Jagdszene
heisst das soviel wie: "Ich weiss, dass du weisst, dass ich hier bin.  Wir
koennen unsere Handlungen so koordinieren, dass wir das Tier toeten,
ohne uns dabei gegenseitig zu gefaehrden."  Solange die Skala
menschlicher Erfahrung begrenzt war, vollzog sich diese UEbereinkunft
stillschweigend.  Sie drueckte sich in reibungslos ablaufenden
Handlungsmustern aus.  Innerhalb einer erweiterten Skala wurden
Zeichen durch Woerter ersetzt, die die Koordination leisteten.  Die
Schrift ermoeglichte sodann Bezugsrahmen und Medium fuer sehr viel
komplexere Taetigkeiten.  Der Internet Browser schliesslich verbindet
eine prinzipiell unbegrenzte Zahl simultan verlaufender
Informationserfahrungen, ohne dass die an diesem Prozess Teilhabenden
sich begruessen oder einander zur Kenntnis nehmen.  Hierdurch entsteht
eine virtuelle Gemeinschaft von Individuen, die an der Erfahrung z.
B. einer tatsaechlich verlaufenden neurochirurgischen Operation
teilhaben.  Solche neuartigen Arbeitsformen charakterisieren in einem
Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur unseren Arbeitsplatz, unsere
Schulen und die Regierungsarbeit; ihnen allen liegen die gleichen
Kommunikationsannahmen zugrunde.

Der Jaeger der Fruehzeit und diejenigen, die heutzutage ihre Praesenz
durch Namensschild, Mobiltelefon, Zugangskarte, Password anzeigen,
unterscheiden sich hinsichtlich der Formen und Mittel, mit denen man
sich der gegenseitigen Praesenz versichert.  Doch selbst die einfache
Begruessung eines Menschen, den wir zu kennen glauben, impliziert die
gesamte oben dargestellte FeedbackAbfolge.  Daraus folgt:
1. Sprache verstehen heisst, alle die zu verstehen, mit denen wir die
praktischen Erfahrungen unserer Selbstkonstituierung teilen. 2. Alle
Beteiligten muessen diese stillschweigend vorausgesetzte
Kommunikationserwartung mitbringen.
3. Jeder neue pragmatische Zusammenhang bringt neue Erfahrungen und
damit neue Formen des Kommunikationsverhaltens und ihrer
Bewusstwerdung mit sich.
Dieses Sprachverstehen vollzieht sich auf der Grundlage der
ausgefuehrten Annahme, "Ich weiss, dass du weisst, dass ich weiss, dass du
weisst...", z. B. um welche Jagdbeute es sich handelt, bzw. was eine
Operation ist, was eine bestimmte Taetigkeit in einem
Produktionsablauf fuer Folgen hat, welche Funktion eine bestimmte
Regierungsstelle hat.  Andernfalls wuerde das Gespraech versiegen, oder
es muesste ein anderes Ausdrucksmittel gefunden werden.

Bestaetigung durch Sprache, Gestik und Mimik signalisiert
erfolgreiches Verstehen.  Wo immer das Verstehen ausbleibt, ist dies
auf fehlende Bestaetigung zurueckzufuehren.  Und wenn diese Bestaetigung
nicht mehr ausschliesslich durch Mittel der Schriftkultur geleistet
werden kann--dazu brauchen wir uns nur die moderne Kriegsfuehrung, die
Kontrolltechnologie fuer Atomreaktoren oder die mannigfaltigen Formen
elektronischer Transaktionen vor Augen zu halten--, dann ist
letztendlich auch die Notwendigkeit der Schriftkultur in Zweifel
gestellt.  Mittlerweile besteht der ueberwiegende Teil der heutzutage
erteilten Anweisungen aus Bildern (Zeichnungen), einer
Ton-BildMischung (Videobaender) oder einer Kombination verschiedener
Medien: die zunehmende Skepsis gegenueber der Schriftkultur, wenn
nicht seitens der Lehrenden, so doch seitens der Lernenden, kommt
also gar nicht so ueberraschend.  Ihre Lebenspraxis und Erfahrung
liegt bereits jenseits der Schriftkultur und einer darauf beruhenden
Form des Verstehens.  Und das gilt nicht nur fuer den Umgang mit dem
Internet, sondern fuer Arbeitsplatz, Schule, Regierung und viele
andere Formen der Lebenspraxis.


Muendlichkeit und die Anfaenge der Schrift

Neben dem allgemeinen Verstehenshintergrund gibt es zahlreiche Ebenen
des Verstehens, die durch die im Sprechen, Schreiben oder anderen
Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsformen enthaltenen Hinweise
repraesentiert werden.  So kann z. B. eine Frage durch einen
bestimmten Tonfall als solche identifiziert werden.  Die Schrift hat
je nach Sprache dafuer ein bestimmtes Zeichen.  Andere Hinweise sind
tiefer verwurzelt, aber nicht weniger wichtig.  Sie beziehen sich auf
die Intention der Aussage, auf den Sprecher (Geschlecht, Beruf,
Alter), den Gespraechskontext oder Hierarchien (soziale, sexuelle,
moralische).  Viel aussersprachliches Hintergrundwissen lenkt das
Verstehen.  Ein Gespraech besteht aus weit mehr als zwei Personen, die
sich Saetze zuspielen.  Es ist eine pragmatische Situation, die neben
der Sprache ebensoviel Verstaendnis des Gespraechskontextes erfordert;
denn jeder Gespraechsteilnehmer konstituiert sich gegenueber dem
anderen.  Die Gespraechssituation macht deutlich, dass das
Sprachverstehen eine supra- (oder para-) linguistische Angelegenheit
ist.  Sie setzt voraus, dass die innerund aussersprachlichen Hinweise
erkannt und zueinander in Beziehung gesetzt werden.  Sie setzt vor
allem eine Rekonstruktion der Erfahrung voraus, die im
Hintergrundwissen verkoerpert ist.

Wenn wir Muendlichkeit und die Anfaenge der Schrift vergleichen,
erkennen wir, dass die Einrichtung von Konventionen sich aus der
Notwendigkeit ergab, die Konkretheit zu ueberwinden und Zugang zu
einem neuen, durch eine veraenderte Lebenspraxis bedingten, kognitiven
Bereich zu finden.  Interessanterweise wurden jedoch Elemente der
Muendlichkeit, die eigentlich einer begrenzteren Erfahrungsskala
entsprachen, in der Struktur der Schrift auf der neuen kognitiven
Ebene beibehalten.  Heute stellt sich die Beibehaltung von
Muendlichkeitselementen weniger dringlich.  Doch man koennte dem
entgegenhalten, dass die im Englischen gelaeufigen Bezeichnungen wie 4
Sale (For Sale) oder Toys ‘R’ Us in die gegenteilige Richtung deuten.
Derartige Versuche, Sprache zu komprimieren, lassen erkennen, wie
man visuelle Zeichen (Ikonen) schafft, um auf einer synthetischen
Ebene den Informationsaustausch zu beschleunigen.  Die interaktiven
Multimedien oder der rege Kommunikationsaustausch im Internet bieten
viele weitere solcher Beispiele.  Schriftkultur ist hierfuer weder
erforderlich noch gefragt.  Es gibt eine ausgepraegte neue Form der
Muendlichkeit, die an einige Merkmale der lange zurueckliegenden
Muendlichkeit erinnert.  Das beherrschende Element dieser neuen
Muendlichkeit ist das Visuelle, das neue ikonische Zeichen.  Beispiele
hierfuer sind das international gelaeufige Valentinsherz anstelle des
Wortes Liebe oder die in Europa verwendeten Zeichen fuer
Pflegehinweise in Kleidungsstuecken.

Die Bezeichnung von Zeitbezuegen in Texten erweist sich als besonders
problematisch aufgrund der fuer unsere Zeit charakteristischen Ablaeufe:
zahlreiche simultan laufende Transaktionen, differenzierte
Arbeitsteilung, Vernetzung, rasche Veraenderung von Regeln.  Das alles
kann in einem geschriebenen Text nicht mehr angemessen wiedergegeben
werden.  Jetzt bedeutet fuer die, die ueber viele Zeitzonen hinweg
miteinander verbunden sind und miteinander kommunizieren, jeweils
etwas ganz anderes.  Der Sonnenaufgang, den wir auf der Web Page von
Santa Monica miterleben, kann mit dem Anklicken einer Taste durch ein
entsprechendes Gedicht ergaenzt werden.  Die der Sprache eigene und in
der Schriftkultur instrumentalisierte Zeit- und Raumerfahrung wird
durch solche Phaenomene nicht unbedingt konsolidiert.

Die Menschheit brauchte einige tausend Jahre, bis sie sich die
Konventionen der Schriftlichkeit angeeignet hatte.  Moeglicherweise
wurden einige dieser Konventionen von der Hardware (Gehirn)
absorbiert und in neue Formen der Selbstkonstituierung umgesetzt.
Die Praxis des Schreibens und die Erkenntnis der Moeglichkeiten, die
sich dadurch oeffneten, fuehrten zu neuen Konventionen.  Praktische
Unternehmungen, die sich aus den neuen in der Schrift (und im Lesen)
angelegten Zeit- und Raumkonventionen ergaben, veraenderten die
Konventionen ebenfalls.  Die Entdeckung der Fragmentarisierbarkeit
von Raum und Zeit etwa, die sich in einer auf Muendlichkeit
basierenden Kultur vermutlich nicht einstellen konnte, liess neue
praktische Erfahrungen und neue Theorien von Raum und Zeit entstehen.

Nachdem sich Schriftlichkeit als praktische Erfahrung durchgesetzt
und eine allseits anerkannte Wirklichkeit auf einer entsprechend
hoeheren Ebene der Abstraktheit begruendet hatte, stellte sich auf
verschiedenen Textebenen eine Fuelle von Assoziationsmoeglichkeiten ein.
Einige davon waren so unerwartet und ungewoehnlich, dass ihr
Verstaendnis eine Herausforderung fuer den Leser darstellte.  Dieses
Verstehensproblem stellt sich offenbar immer dann ein, wenn neue
Ebenen ins Spiel kommen, wie zum Beispiel die der
Selbstreferentialitaet, die in der verkabelten Welt der Home Page
allgegenwaertig ist.  Sprache wird zunehmend zu einem Medium, an dem
wir die Beziehung zwischen dem Bewussten, dem Unbewussten oder
Unterbewussten und der Sprache beobachten koennen.  Bei der oben
erwaehnten Gehirnoperation wurden bestimmte Neuronen gehemmt und auf
diese Weise das Erkennen von Gegenstaenden und Taetigkeiten
eingeschraenkt.

Die unnatuerliche, nichtsprachliche Sprachverwendung wird heute von
Psychologie, Neurologie, Kognitionswissenschaft und kuenstlicher
Intelligenzforschung auf das Verhaeltnis zwischen Sprache und
Intelligenz hin untersucht.  Die Notwendigkeit, die biologischen
Aspekte der Sprech-, Schreibund Lesepraxis zu behandeln, ergibt sich
aus unserer Praemisse.  Die menschliche Selbstkonstituierung vollzieht
sich, waehrend und indem die biologischen Faehigkeiten in Erfahrung
umgesetzt werden.  Die Arbeit mit sogenannten splitbrain
Patienten--Menschen, bei denen die Verbindung zwischen den beiden
Gehirnhaelften unterbrochen wurde, um epileptische Anfaelle zu
verhindern--hat gezeigt, dass sogar die scharfe Trennung zwischen
linker und rechter Gehirnhaelfte (der linke Teil steuert das
Sprachvermoegen) fragwuerdig ist.  Es zeigte sich, dass bei jeder
einzelnen praktischen Erfahrung des Menschen die biologische
Ausruestung taetig, aber gleichzeitig zum Gegenstand der
Selbstreflexion wird.  Als man das Wort Lach! in den rechten Teil des
Blickfeldes projizierte, fingen die Patienten an zu lachen, obwohl
sie das Wort theoretisch gar nicht haetten aufnehmen koennen.  Auf
Befragung erklaerten sie ihr Lachen mit Gruenden, die nicht in
Beziehung zum sprachlichen Stimulus standen.  AEhnliches ergab sich
bei der Aufforderung, sich zu kratzen.  Diese und andere klinische
Beobachtungen werden in der Erfahrungswelt der virtuellen Realitaet
aufgegriffen und nutzbar gemacht.  In einem gegebenen Umfeld der
virtuellen Realitaet ist zum Beispiel das Nichtvorhandene bisweilen
ebenso wichtig wie das, was man vorfindet.  In den
Hintergrundskanaelen, die die Interaktionsmuster der virtuellen
Realitaet verarbeiten, koennen neben Woertern auch Reaktionsdaten der
Agierenden (Drehungen des Kopfes, Schliessen der Augen,
Handbewegungen) uebertragen werden.  Sie werden im Feedback wieder in
die virtuelle Realitaet als deren neuer Bestandteil eingegeben und der
Lage dessen angepasst, der sich dieser Wirklichkeit ueberlaesst.  Aus
diesem Grund bleiben die Merkmale der muendlichen Kommunikation--des
fruehen und des gegenwaertigen Entwicklungsstadiums--von besonderer
Bedeutung.

In der muendlichen Kommunikation ist Hintergrundwissen leichter
verfuegbar.  Die groessere Naehe zwischen Ding und Wort, die
Gegenwaertigkeit der Kommunizierenden und deren Bereitschaft, die
Beziehung zwischen Wort und Bezeichnetem aufzuzeigen, die allgemeine
Verfuegbarkeit der an das Wort geknuepften Erfahrung sowie die
Eins-zu-Eins-Relation zwischen Wort und Bezeichnetem erleichtern das
Lesen und UEbersetzen des Wortes.  In mancherlei Hinsicht macht die
Eltern-Kind-Beziehung dieses Kindheitsstadium der Menschheit
sinnfaellig.

In der jenseits der Schriftkultur sich abzeichnenden neuen
Muendlichkeit wird dieselbe Eins-zu-Eins-Relation durch
Segmentierungsstrategien erreicht.  Sprecher und Hoerer teilen Raum
und Zeit--und damit Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und bis zu einem
gewissen Grad Zukunft.  Selbst wenn der Gespraechsgegenstand nicht auf
den speziellen Ort und Augenblick bezogen ist, wird ein
Referenzmechanismus in Gang gesetzt dank der Tatsache, dass die
Gespraechsteilnehmer die Erfahrung der Selbstkonstituierung teilen.
Entfernt heisst entfernt vom Gespraechsort; vor langer Zeit heisst lange
vor dem Zeitpunkt des Gespraechs.  Das Erlernen von entfernt, vor
langer (kurzer) Zeit resultiert bereits aus lebenspraktischen
Umstaenden, die zu einem hoeheren Entwicklungsstadium fuehrten.  Heute
sind solche Unterschiede fuer uns selbstverstaendlich, und wir sind
ueberrascht, wenn Kinder um genauere Angaben bitten oder ein
Computerprogramm nicht funktioniert, weil die Eingaben keinen
ausreichenden Distinktionsgrad aufweisen.

Die Kategorisierung von Zeit und Raum entspricht einem relativ spaeten
Entwicklungsstadium.  Sie ergab sich aus einer Skala mit linearen
Beziehungen, als Ergebnis wiederholter entsprechender Erfahrungen von
Abfolgen, die sich zu Erfahrungsmustern verfestigten.  Als dieser
Referenzmechanismus fuer Raum und Zeit allgemein verbreitet und in
neue Erfahrungen integriert war, versetzte er den Menschen in die
Lage, die Sprache zu vereinfachen und ueber das tatsaechlich Gesagte
hinaus Annahmen und Vermutungen zu ergaenzen.  Heute ist unsere
Erfahrung von Raum und Zeit durch Relativitaet gekennzeichnet.
Entsprechend bedeutet der Rueckgriff auf Muendlichkeit jenseits der
Schriftkultur nicht die Rueckkehr zur primitiven Muendlichkeit, sondern
die Erstellung einer Referenzstruktur, die die Dynamik der heute
moeglichen Beziehungen besser verarbeitet.  Raum und Zeit in
virtuellen Erfahrungen sind Beispiele dafuer, dass wir uns von der
Sprache befreit haben, nicht aber von den Erfahrungen, durch die wir
unser Zeit- und Raumverstaendnis erworben haben.


Annahmen

Annahmen sind eine wichtige Komponente fuer das Funktionieren von
Zeichensystemen.  Ein zurueckgebliebener Abdruck kann Sinn ergeben,
wenn er bemerkt wird.  Die Annahme, dass etwas erkannt oder bemerkt
wird, ist die minimale Voraussetzung dafuer, dass etwas als Ausdruck
gilt.  Die mit dem Schreiben verbundenen Annahmen sind andere als die
der Muendlichkeit.  Sie umfassen strukturale Merkmale der praktischen
Erfahrungen, innerhalb derer die schreibenden Menschen ihre Identitaet
setzen.  Schriftkulturelle Annahmen sind im Gegensatz zu anderen der
Sprachlichkeit eigenen Annahmen Erweiterungen der linearen,
sequentiellen Erfahrung mit all ihren konstitutiven Teilen.  Sie
schlagen sich im Vokabular nieder, besonders aber in der Grammatik.
Die neue Muendlichkeit hingegen ist eine Erfahrung jenseits des
Bereichs, der durch die Mittel und Methoden der Schriftkultur
bestimmt ist.  Diese neue Kultur stellt die Notwendigkeit und
Berechtigung der schriftkulturellen Annahmen in Frage, und zwar
besonders mit Blick darauf, wie sie sich auf die Effizienz des
Menschen auswirken.

Die heute selbstverstaendlichen differenzierten Bezeichnungen fuer Zeit
und Raum haben sich nur allmaehlich und zunaechst in wenig
differenzierter Weise durchsetzen koennen.  Und trotz unseres
ungeheuren Fortschritts muessen wir auch heute noch im Umgang mit Zeit
und Raum auf das Repertoire zurueckgreifen, das in den fruehen Stadien
der Menschheit entwickelt wurde.  Bewegungen von Hand, Kopf oder
anderen Koerperteilen (Koerpersprache), Veraenderungen des
Gesichtsausdrucks und der Hautfarbe (Erroeten), Atemrhythmus und
Stimmvariation (Intonation, Pause, Sprachfluss)--all dies laesst
erkennen, dass im Gespraech eine Erfahrung wachgerufen wird, die von
der Sprache allein nicht getragen werden kann.  Und diese
paralinguistischen Elemente sind in den neuen
Erfahrungszusammenhaengen interaktiver virtueller Welten nicht weniger
bedeutungsvoll.

Die paralinguistischen Elemente, die in primitiven
Lebensgemeinschaften bewusst verwendet werden oder unbewusst vorhanden
sind, entziehen sich der naeheren Erforschung.  Innerhalb von
Lebensgemeinschaften, deren Angehoerige die gleichen genetischen
Voraussetzungen mitbringen, nehmen sie unterschiedliche Formen an.
Sie sind keineswegs auf Sprache beschraenkt, wenngleich sie an die
Erfahrung der Sprachverwendung geknuepft sind.  Das gilt zum Beispiel
fuer das ausgepraegte Rhythmusgefuehl der Schwarzen in Amerika und
Afrika oder die holistische Weltsicht der Chinesen und Japaner.  Wir
koennen lediglich aus Woertern in den von uns rekonstruierten
Protosprachen oder der vermuteten einheitlichen Muttersprache der
Menschheit (Proto-Welt) folgern, dass Woerter in Verbindung mit
nichtsprachlichen Einheiten verwendet wurden.  Ob es eine solche
Muttersprache der Menschheit, eine vorbabylonische Sprache je gegeben
hat, ist eine andere Frage.  In dieser Frage verbirgt sich die Suche
nach einem allen Menschen gemeinsamen Vorfahren und dessen
vermeintlicher Sprache.  Wichtiger ist jedoch, dass die praktische
Erfahrung der Herausbildung von Sprache keineswegs alles
Nichtsprachliche eliminiert.  Das paralinguistische Element bleibt
fuer die Effizienz menschlicher Aktivitaeten selbst dann wichtig, wenn
Sprachlichkeit eine so beherrschende Rolle spielt wie im Zeitalter
der Schriftkultur.  Ein Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur wird nun
nicht notwendig die paralinguistischen UEberreste zurueckliegender
Erfahrungsraeume ausgraben.  Vielmehr wird ein Rahmen geschaffen, der
ihre Einbindung in eine effektivere Lebenspraxis ermoeglicht, in einen
Prozess mit technologischen Moeglichkeiten, die alle erdenklichen
Hinweise verarbeiten kann.

In einem bestimmten Rahmen von Raum und Zeit werden paralinguistische
Zeichen stark konventionalisiert.  Die Entwicklung des englischen
Wortes I (im Gegensatz zu seinen Entsprechungen in anderen Sprachen:
ich, je, yo, eu, en, ani usw.) oder die Art, wie sich die auf das
Wort two bezogenen Woerter entwickelten (Haende, Beine, Augen, Ohren,
Eltern), geben hierfuer aufschlussreiche Hinweise.  Vermutlich trat zum
Beispiel das Paar zunaechst als grammatische Kategorie auf und wurde
durch nichtsprachliche Zeichen markiert (Klatschen, Wiederholung,
Aufzeigen).  Einige solcher Zeichen sind noch heute gebraeuchlich.
Grammatische Kategorie und die Unterscheidung zwischen eins und zwei
haengen zusammen.  Die Aranda in Australien verwenden die Woerter eins
und zwei als Grundlage ihrer Arithmetik.  Ebenso beginnt der Plural
mit zwei.  Das erscheint uns heute als selbstverstaendlich, aber
einige Sprachen (z. B. Japanisch) kennen keinen Plural.  Und
schliesslich koennen die gleiche Zeichen (das Zeigen mit dem Finger,
Signale der Hand) in verschiedenen Kulturen unterschiedliche
Bedeutungen haben.  Kopfnicken bedeutet bei den Bulgaren Ablehnung,
Kopfschuetteln Zustimmung.

Innerhalb einer Kultur wird jedes Zeichen zu einer bedeutenden
Hintergrundkomponente, denn es verkoerpert die gemeinsame Erfahrung,
die es hervorbrachte.  Im direkten Gespraech kennen sich entweder die
Gespraechsteilnehmer oder sie lernen sich kennen; was sich in der
skizzierten und weiter kumulierbaren Voraussetzung des "Ich weiss, dass
du weisst, dass ich weiss, dass du weisst" ausdrueckt.  Sprechen und
Zuhoeren werden so zu einer Erfahrung des gegenseitigen Verstehens,
vor allem wenn sich das Gespraech in einem nicht-linearen,
unbestimmten Kontext vollzieht, der in Form von Schriftlichkeit nicht
mehr nachgebildet werden kann.  Hierzu zaehlen die Kontakte in der
elektronisch vernetzten Welt und extrem schnelle Transaktionen
(Boersenhandel, Weltraumforschung, militaerische Operationen), die mit
den begrenzten Moeglichkeiten der Schriftkultur nicht zu leisten sind.

Muendlichkeit kann deklarativer, interrogativer oder imperativer Natur
sein.  Mit zunehmend vertiefter Erfahrung im Umgang mit Sprache und
aufgrund der dem muendlichen Sprachgebrauch impliziten Annahmen
entwickelte der Mensch allmaehlich seine interaktive Natur.  Diese
ergab sich aus veraenderten Lebensbedingungen: in der Natur war
Interaktion auf Aktion-Reaktion begrenzt; im menschlichen Leben
entwickelten sich aus diesem interaktiven Grundmuster
Interaktionsabfolgen, welche die Bereiche des gemeinsamen Interesses
definierten.  Die fortschreitende kognitive Erkenntnis, dass die
Ansprache an ein Gegenueber dessen Faehigkeit des Verstehens, bzw. bei
unvollstaendigem Verstehen die Verpflichtung zur Erlaeuterung
beinhaltet, ist eine weitere Quelle unserer interaktiven Veranlagung.
Fragen uebernehmen die Funktion der direkten paralinguistischen
Zeichen und ergaenzen die interaktive Qualitaet des Dialogs, solange
eine gemeinsame Grundlage besteht.  Diese gemeinsame Grundlage gilt
denen, die an der Schriftkultur festhalten, als notwendige
Voraussetzung jeglicher Interaktion, wird aber unterschiedlich
definiert: einmal beruht sie auf Vokabular und Grammatik, ein anderes
Mal auf Logik, Phonetik, Aussprache oder dem kulturellen Erbe.  Gewiss
ist eine gemeinsame Sprache die notwendige Voraussetzung fuer
Kommunikation; das heisst aber noch lange nicht, dass eine solche
Sprache ausreichend oder ausreichend effizient dafuer ist.  Die
Interaktivitaet, die sich jenseits des schriftkulturellen Modells
etabliert hat, laesst es moeglich, wenn nicht gar notwendig erscheinen,
dass die ueblichen Spracherwartungen abgelegt und durch variable Kodes
ersetzt werden, wie wir sie im Umgang mit den multimedialen
Einrichtungen oder den Interaktionsablaeufen im Internet entwickelt
haben.


Wie wichtig ist Literalitaet?

In den voraufgegangenen Kapiteln haben wir uns gefragt, was neben
einer gemeinsamen Sprache fuer ein sinnvolles Gespraech notwendig ist.
Skala ist hierfuer ein weiterer Faktor.  Die Skala, die einen Dialog
bestimmt, unterscheidet sich von der Skala, innerhalb derer sich die
menschliche Selbstkonstituierung einschliesslich des Spracherwerbs und
der Sprachverwendung vollzieht.  Skala allein reicht nicht aus, um
einen Dialog zu definieren oder die umfassendere sprachbezogene oder
sprachbegruendete praktische Taetigkeit, durch die der Mensch seine
biologische Anlage und seine spezifisch menschlichen Eigenschaften
realisiert.  Wir haben ausreichende Hinweise darauf, dass der Mensch
im fruehen Entwicklungsstadium nur homogene Aufgaben loesen konnte.
Innerhalb eines solchen Rahmens war der Dialog Traeger von Kooperation
und Bestaetigung oder von Konflikten.  Mit zunehmender Diversifikation
nahm er eine heuristische Dimension an--die Auswahl des Nuetzlichen
aus einer Reihe von Moeglichkeiten, selbst wenn dabei Zusammenhang und
Vollstaendigkeit aus dem Blick gerieten.  In einer verallgemeinerten,
auf Sprache gruendenden Lebenspraxis kam neben der Heuristik ("Wenn es
hilft, tu es") auch die Logik ins Spiel ("Wenn es richtig ist" /
"Wenn es sinnvoll ist"), und durch deren Vermittlung gehoerten
schliesslich auch Wahrheit und Unwahrheit zum Spektrum der
Spracherfahrung.  Damit wirkt Sprache integrativ.  Dieser integrative
Einfluss verstaerkt sich in dem Masse, in dem Muendlichkeit durch die
begrenzte Schriftkultur von Schreiben und Lesen ersetzt wird.

Die Schriftkultur der Industriegesellschaft stillte den Bedarf nach
einheitlichen und zentralisierten Rahmen fuer die Lebenspraxis
innerhalb einer Skala, der die Linearitaet der Sprache auf optimale
Weise gerecht wurde.  Heutzutage konstituieren wir uns und unsere
Sprache durch Erfahrungen, die es in einer solchen Vielfalt bislang
nicht gegeben hat.  Diese Erfahrungen sind kuerzer und relativ
partiell, sie stellen nur einen kurzen Moment dar in dem
umfassenderen Prozess, den sie ermoeglichen.  Das Ergebnis ist eine
soziale Aufsplitterung.  Sie vollzieht sich selbst innerhalb der
angenommenen Grenzen einer Sprachgemeinschaft, die angeblich eine
Nation ausmachen und die paradoxerweise ihr angekuendigtes Ende
ueberdauern.  In Wirklichkeit gibt es gar keine gemeinsame Sprache
einer Sprachgemeinschaft mehr, zumindest funktioniert sie nicht mehr
so wie gewohnt.  An ihre Stelle treten provisorische Bindungen, die
einen neuen Rahmen fuer Taetigkeiten bieten, die man nicht mehr als
eine durch Schriftkultur definierte Erfahrung ausueben kann.  Fuer jede
dieser schnellebigen und rasch sich veraendernden Bindungen entwickeln
sich Teilsprachen von begrenzter Dauer und begrenztem Wirkungskreis.
Sie wiederum sind begleitet von Subformen der Schrift und Bildung.
Eine derartige Erfahrung bietet eine neue Plattform fuer vermehrte
Muendlichkeit unter Bedingungen, die nicht mehr der Schriftkultur
eigen sind, sondern aus neuen Technologien jenseits der Praxis der
Schriftkultur hervorgehen und daher eine erhoehte Effizienz aufweisen.
Darueber hinaus koennen natuerliche Zeichen oder Hieroglyphen bestimmte
Anweisungen ebenso gut oder gar besser als die Schrift vermitteln.

Die Schriftkultur legt eine Reihe von stillschweigenden Annahmen nahe:
In der Schriftkultur gebildete Eltern erziehen ihre Kinder zu
entsprechender Bildung.  Gemeinschaftssinn setzt voraus, dass die
Mitglieder einer Gemeinschaft von der Zweckmaessigkeit dieser Bildung
ueberzeugt sind und an ihr teilhaben.  Religiositaet ist an Bildung
gebunden.  Nur gebildete Menschen koennen am gesellschaftlichen Leben
teilnehmen.  Wir sollten uns angesichts solcher Annahmen jedoch
vergegenwaertigen, dass der abstrakte Bildungsbegriff, der davon
ausgeht, dass eine gemeinsame Sprache automatisch zu gemeinsamen
Erfahrungen fuehrt, falsche Hoffnungen weckt.  Die Kinder gebildeter
Eltern sind keineswegs ebenfalls gebildet.  Es ist viel
wahrscheinlicher, dass sie wie die Kinder aus anderen Elternhaeusern
laengst in die jenseits der Schriftkultur angesiedelten Arbeits- und
Lebensstrukturen eingebunden sind.  Das ist weder eine Frage der
individuellen Entscheidung, noch der elterlichen Autoritaet.

Auf dem digitalen Highway, auf dem immer mehr Menschen ihre
Koordinaten setzen, etablieren sich Beziehungsgemeinschaften, die an
keine Lokalitaet gebunden sind.  Das allenthalben vorherrschende
Zeichen @ traegt dabei allein die noetige Identifikationsleistung.  Die
Teilhabe an solchen Gemeinschaften ist grundverschieden von allen
bisher gelaeufigen Formen der auf Schriftkultur beruhenden
Gemeinschaft, die von gegenseitigen Abhaengigkeiten getragen und durch
Schreibfaehigkeit ebenso wie durch Autoritaet und an industrielle
Produktionszyklen gebundene Arbeitsweisen gekennzeichnet sind.

In den Kommunikationsformen unserer Zeit ist die Bildungs- und
Schriftkulturkomponente nicht nur zurueckgedraengt, sie verzeichnet im
Vergleich zu anderen Kommunikationsformen den staerksten prozentualen
Rueckgang.  In diesem neuen Rahmen muessen Staatsgebilde und
Verwaltungsapparate um ihr UEberleben kaempfen.  Doch die dafuer
verwendeten Methoden und Instrumente der Schriftkultur haben sich
wiederholt als ineffizient erwiesen.  Solche Feststellungen eruebrigen
keineswegs Fragen nach dem Verstehen von Schrift, von welcher Bildung
und Schriftkultur staerker abhaengen als von gesprochener Sprache.
Doch zu den neuen Fragestellungen dieses Buches gehoert auch, wie sich
Sprachverstehen vollzieht in einem neuen pragmatischen Rahmen, in dem
Sprache von den Beschraenkungen der Schriftkultur befreit ist.


Was ist Verstehen?

Die Anfaenge der Schrift hatten piktographischen Charakter.  Der
Vorteil lag im direkten Zugang zur Welt, die unmittelbar und fuer alle
gleichermassen zu erkennen war; der Nachteil lag darin, dass der
Verallgemeinerungsgrad des Ausdrucks nur potentiell gegeben war.  Die
Notation blieb auf die Dinge, weniger auf die Sprache bezogen.  Diese
bildbezogene Sprache entwickelte sich analog zu einem relativ
einfachen Rahmen der Raum- und Zeitbezeichnung.

Die Alphabetschrift ueberwindet den auf AEhnlichkeit beruhenden
Erfahrungsrahmen.  Wenn Zeit nicht ausdruecklich angegeben ist oder
Raumkoordinaten nicht bewusst benannt werden, sind Zeit und Raum im
Text und in der Grammatik umgesetzt.  Damit veraendert sich die
Kommunikation, sie wird durch abstrakte Groessen vermittelt, deren
Bezug zur Erfahrung sich wiederum aus zahlreichen Substitutionen
ergibt, ueber die der Leser nicht verfuegt.

Hinweise in der Schrift sind zuallererst Hinweise auf Sprache, erst
in zweiter Linie auf menschliche Erfahrung.  Die Lektuere eines Textes
erfordert daher die aufwendige kognitive Rekonstruktion der
ausgedrueckten Erfahrung und ist stets mit der Unsicherheit darueber
verbunden, ob das Verstandene auch angemessen verstanden wurde.  Bei
der Lektuere eines Textes gibt es niemanden, den man fragen kann, der
unser Verstehen seinerseits aktiv nachvollzieht oder es bezweifelt.
Der Autor existiert als Projektion im Text nicht anders als der Autor
in den von uns gekauften und verwendeten Waren.  Jeder Text ist eine
Realitaet auf Papier oder anderen Speichern und Vermittlungstraegern.
Hinweise koennen aus Autorennamen oder aus historischen Kenntnissen
gewonnen werden.  Niemals aber kann es den gegenseitigen Austausch
eines muendlichen Gespraechs geben, das gemeinsame Bemuehen der
gegenwaertigen Kommunikationspartner.

Wie komplex Schrift auch immer sein mag, es fehlt ihr doch die
interaktive Komponente der Muendlichkeit.  Diese Einschraenkung ist
einer der Gruende dafuer, dass Schriftkultur unsere aus der Praxis der
Interaktivitaet hervorgehenden Erwartungen nicht mehr erfuellen kann.
Eine metaphorische Verwendung des Begriffs der Interaktivitaet, die
die "interaktive" Beziehung zwischen Leser und Text durch Lektuere,
Interpretation und Verstehen beschreibt, ist eine ganz andere
Angelegenheit.  Schwierigkeiten beim Sprachverstehen koennen natuerlich
ueberwunden werden, aber nicht mechanisch dadurch, dass ich die
Sprachfaehigkeit durch das Erlernen von fuenfzig weiteren Vokabeln oder
eines weiteren Grammatikkapitels verbessere, sondern nur ueber
verbessertes Hintergrundwissen durch Erweiterung der Erfahrung, auf
der dieses gemeinsame Wissen beruht.

Wenn wir indes diesen Weg einschlagen, verlassen wir den
einheitlichen Rahmen der Schriftkultur, innerhalb dessen die
Erfahrungsvielfalt auf Schreiben, Lesen und Sprechen beschraenkt ist.
Wenn diese Beschraenkung nicht mehr leistungsfaehig ist--was wir unter
den derzeitigen Existenzbedingungen zunehmend erfahren--, wird auch
das Verstehen von Sprache immer schwieriger.  Andererseits haengt
unsere Selbstkonstituierung von dem Ergebnis unseres Sprachverstehens
ab.  Als einfaches Beispiel koennen uns hier die zahlreichen
Handbuecher zur Computer-Software dienen.  Sie sind in einfacher
Sprache abgefasst, aber dennoch schwer zu verstehen.  Und sind sie
einmal verstanden, ist der Ertrag mager.  Daher ist man auch dazu
uebergegangen, anstelle der schriftlichen Anleitung die noetigen
Anweisungen online zu geben, und zwar durch graphische Darstellung
oder durch einfache bewegte Bilder.  Der vorliegende Rahmen der
Spezialisierung beschraenkt dabei die Anweisung auf das fuer die
Aufgabe notwendige Ausmass.  Im Rahmen einer derartigen
fortschreitenden Spezialisierung werden dann auch Lesen und Schreiben
zu einem Bereich der Spezialisierung unter anderen.  Schriftkultur
und darauf beruhende Bildung ist damit eine bestimmte, spezifische
Form menschlicher Praxis, und nicht mehr ihr gemeinsamer Nenner.

Das Schreiben als eine eigene spezifische Form der Praxis traegt in
diesem Zusammenhang zur Aufsplitterung der Gesellschaft, statt zu
ihrer Vereinigung bei.  Spezialisierte Formen des Schreibens foerdern
die allgemeine Tendenz zur Spezialisierung und rufen spezialisierte
Formen des Lesens hervor.  Das sei etwas naeher erlaeutert.

Selbst wenn Autoren versuchen, ihre Sprache auf ein bestimmtes
Lesepublikum auszurichten, sind sie nur teilweise erfolgreich, weil
die involvierten Erfahrungsbereiche nicht deckungsgleich sind.
Entweder wird der Autor zum Opfer der Sprache (jenem
hochspezialisierten Sprachregister, das auf einen spezifischen
Wissensbereich zugeschnitten ist) und ahmt in Grammatik und Rhetorik
das normale Gespraechsverhalten nach.  Oder aber er uebersetzt oder
erlaeutert, wie in populaerwissenschaftlichen Publikationen zu Physik,
Genetik, den Kuensten oder der Psychologie.  In diesem
interpretierenden Diskurs werden Einzelheiten ausgelassen oder
ergaenzt, um die Wissensgrundlage zu erweitern.  Bestimmte
Ausdrucksmittel wie Vergleiche und Metaphern sollen unterschiedliche
Hintergruende ueberbruecken und die Leser zu neuen Erfahrungsebenen
fuehren.  Und selbst wenn sich die Leser dieser Mittel bewusst sind,
kann das nicht den Mangel an Erfahrung ausgleichen, wodurch allein
ein Text Sinn ergibt.  Ein juristischer Schriftsatz, ein
militaerischer Text, eine Investmentanalyse, die Evaluierung eines
Computerprogramms sind Beispiele hierfuer.  Sie sind auf Englisch oder
Deutsch geschrieben, aber sie beziehen sich auf Erfahrungsbereiche,
die nur Juristen, Offizieren, Maklern oder Programmierern zugaenglich
sind.

Autoren, Redner, Leser und Zuhoerer sind sich der Anpassungen bewusst,
die zum Verstaendnis dieser und aehnlicher Texttypen noetig sind.  Ein
direktes Gespraech, fuer das man allerdings gemeinsame Zeit aufbringen
muss, kann einen solchen Anpassungsrahmen bieten, eine gedruckte
Textseite sehr viel weniger.  Bestenfalls kann ein Leser seine
Reaktion wiederum zu Papier bringen oder schriftlich um ergaenzende
Erlaeuterungen bitten, um auf diese Weise den Geist des Gespraechs zu
treffen.  Die Erfahrung des Schreibens und Lesens hat immer weniger
den Charakter einer allgemeinen Erfahrung und immer mehr den einer
hochspezialisierten Taetigkeit.  Schrift kann von Maschinen gelesen
werden.  Als Hilfsmittel fuer Blinde lesen solche Maschinen
Anleitungen, Zeitungsartikel und Untertitel von Videofilmen.
Synthetische Stimme, Auge und Nase, Beruehrungssensor oder
Geschmacksuebersetzer operieren in einem Bereich, der voellig losgeloest
ist von dem Leben, das in den entsprechenden Text (Bild, Geruch,
Textur, Geschmack) eingegangen ist und das der Leser (Zuschauer,
Riechende, Fuehlende, Schmeckende) von sich aus hinzuzufuegen haette.

Schriftkultur, verstanden als ein universelles und immerwaehrendes
Medium fuer Ausdruck, Kommunikation und Bezeichnung hat eine
romantische oder auch demokratische Haltung gegenueber Kunst, Politik
und Wissenschaft gepflegt.  Sie ging von folgenden Voraussetzungen
aus: da jeder reden, schreiben und lesen sollte, kann und soll ein
jeder reden, schreiben und lesen; kann und soll ein jeder Literatur
moegen, am politischen Leben teilhaben und die Wissenschaften
verstehen.  Das traf in gewissem Masse auch zu, solange Dichtung,
Politik und Wissenschaft mehr oder weniger unmittelbare Bestandteile
der Lebenspraxis waren und der Skala der menschlichen Taetigkeit
entsprachen, die sich in linearen, homogenen Erfahrungen
herausbildete.  Nun, da sich die Skala veraendert, die Dynamik
beschleunigt, die Vermittlung vermehrt und Nicht-Linearitaet etabliert
hat, stehen wir vor einer neuen Situation.  Dichter, Redenschreiber
und Wissenschaftsautor wenden sich laengst nicht mehr an die gesamte
Bevoelkerung; mehr noch, da sie selbst den Prozessen der
Arbeitsteilung unterworfen sind, tragen sie auf ihre Weise zur
Foerderung von Teilbildung und Aufsplitterung der Gesellschaft bei,
obwohl sie eigentlich das Gegenteil bewirken wollen.  Als Reaktion
auf die traditionellen Ansprueche der Schriftkultur stellt eine
allgemeine dekonstruktivistische Haltung gegenueber Texten die
Dauerhaftigkeit der philosophischen Abhandlung, wissenschaftlicher
Systeme, der Mathematik, des politischen Diskurses und vor allem der
Literatur in Frage.  Die Methode ist ueberall die gleiche: die
Mechanismen aufzuzeigen, die die Illusion von Dauerhaftigkeit und
Wahrheit schaffen.  Texte sind ploetzlich nur noch Mittel zu einem
Zweck, der nicht mehr unmittelbar zaehlt.  Daraus ergibt sich eine
Beschreibung der Ausdruckstechnologie, die von all jenen begruesst wird,
die gegenueber der Universalitaet von Wissenschaft, Politik und
Literatur skeptisch geworden sind.  Wenn jedes Zeichen (unabhaengig
vom Thema) nur sich selbst bezeichnet und die in ihm verkoerperte
Erfahrung diejenige seiner Hervorbringung ist, dann haette das Projekt
des Dekonstruktivismus seinen Hoehepunkt erreicht.


Worte ueber Bilder

Das geschriebene Wort trat fast immer, wie wir wissen, zusammen mit
anderen Bezeichnungssystemen auf, besonders mit Bildern.  Insofern
ist unsere Frage, was wir beim Verstehen von Sprache verstehen, auch
geknuepft an die Frage, ob Bilder beim Verstehen von Texten hilfreich
sein koennen.  Zweifellos tragen Bilder (zumindest manche) aufgrund
ihrer kognitiven Merkmale bessere Interpretationshinweise als Woerter
oder Schriftmittel.  Bilder koennen besser als Texte den abwesenden
Autor ersetzen.  Sofern sie den Konventionen der Realitaet folgen,
kann ein Individuum mit ihrer Hilfe den Raum- und Zeitrahmen oder
eines von beiden wachrufen.  Andererseits sind Bilder nicht unbedingt
die besseren Informationsvermittler, ihre Vorzuege gehen auf Kosten
des Verstehens, der Klarheit oder der Kontextabhaengigkeit.

Vor allem kann die Konkretheit des Bildes die Vorteile der
Abstraktion nicht ersetzen.  Das dichte Medium der Schrift steht in
deutlichem Kontrast zum diffusen Medium des Bildes.  Auch ist die
jeweilige Komplexitaet nicht vergleichbar.  Im Internet einen Text
herunterzuladen ist etwas ganz anderes, als Bilder darzubieten.  Wenn
allerdings die Komplexitaet eines Bildes hoch ist, wird seine
Dekodierung genauso kompliziert wie die eines Textes und das Ergebnis
entsprechend weniger genau.  Daher versucht man es am liebsten mit
einer Kombination aus Bild und Wort.  Wir koennen daraus auch etwas
ueber die Strategien fuer die Verknuepfung von Text und Bild lernen:
Redundanz richtet die Interpretation auf das Wesentliche;
Komplementaritaet erweitert den interpretatorischen Blickwinkel;
andere Strategien wie Kontrastierung von Text und Bild,
Paraphrasierung des Textes durch Bilder oder das Ersetzen des einen
durch das andere beeinflussen je auf ihre Weise durch die
Bereitstellung von Erklaerungszusammenhaengen die Interpretation.
Weite Bereiche unserer heutigen Kultur--von Comics und Bildromanen
ueber Werbung und Soap Operas im Internet--greifen auf solche und
aehnliche Strategien zurueck.

Im vorliegenden Zusammenhang stellt sich die Frage, ob die Erfahrung,
die wir fuer das Verstaendnis eines Textes benoetigen, durch Bilder
ersetzt werden kann.  Sollten wir sie bejahen koennen, wuerden Bilder
fast die Rolle eines Gespraechspartners uebernehmen.  Als Produkte der
menschlichen Erfahrung verkoerpern Bilder genauso wie die Sprache eben
diese Erfahrung.  Das Verstehen von Bildern ist also nicht
gleichzusetzen mit der blossen Anschauung von ihnen.  Das hat sich
bereits bei geschriebener Sprache gezeigt.  Woerter oder Saetze auf dem
Papier zu sehen geht deren Verstehen voraus.  Die Natuerlichkeit der
Bilder (jedenfalls solcher, die dem aeusserlichen Erscheinungsbild
unserer Welt entsprechen) macht den Zugang zu ihnen bisweilen
leichter als den zur geschriebenen Sprache.  Aber dieser Zugang
ergibt sich niemals automatisch und sollte nicht als
selbstverstaendlich angesehen werden.  Und waehrend das geschriebene
Wort nicht unmittelbar zur Nachahmung einlaedt, spielen Bilder hier
eine aktivere Rolle und loesen andere Reaktionen als Woerter aus.
Sprachkodes und visuelle Kodes sind nicht aufeinander reduzierbar;
sie besitzen unterschiedliche pragmatische Funktionen.

Vorliegende Forschungsergebnisse erweisen ziemlich eindeutig, dass ein
mithilfe von Bildern verbessertes Textverstaendnis nicht einfach auf
die Praesenz von Bildern zurueckzufuehren ist, sondern auf bestimmte
Lesermerkmale.  Das zeigt erneut, wie wichtig ein Hintergrundwissen
fuer das Verstaendnis von Texten, Bildern und anderen zur Sprache
verfestigten Ausdrucksformen ist.  Die Forschungsverfahren beruhten
dabei auf empirischen Messungen von sogenannten
Textverarbeitungsprozessen bei Lesern.  Bei den Untersuchungen wurden
die Augenbewegungen aufgezeichnet und mit dem Textverstaendnis
korreliert, was Aufschluss ueber die Interaktion von Text und Bild gab.
So sind Bilder fuer sogenannte schlechte Leser eindeutig hilfreich.
Fuer erfahrene Leser waren Bilder irrelevant, wenn die Information im
Mittelpunkt stand.  War die Information weniger wichtig,
beeintraechtigten Bilder die Lektuere.  Auch zeigte sich, dass der
Texttyp--expositorisch, erzaehlend--kein besonderer Faktor ist und dass
Bilder dabei helfen, Texteinzelheiten zu erinnern.  Das ist
allerdings schon seit mindestens 300 Jahren bekannt.  Im
elisabethanischen Theater lernten die Schauspieler ihre Texte
auswendig, indem sie bestimmte Passagen mit bestimmten
architektonischen Details des Theatergebaeudes verknuepften.
Letztendlich ergaben all diese Untersuchungen, dass die Auswirkung von
Bildern auf das Verstaendnis geschriebener Texte nicht leicht zu
erklaeren ist.  Das kann kaum ueberraschen, wenn man auf
Schriftlichkeit basierende Messverfahren verwendet, um die Grenzen der
Schriftlichkeit zu bestimmen.  Ob zufaellig auftretende oder dem Leser
aufgenoetigte Bilder, ob quasi-lineare oder komplizierte Texte (d. h.
solche, die auf komplexe praktische Erfahrungen zurueckgehen)--die
Beziehung zwischen Bild und Text scheint keinem klaren Muster zu
folgen.  Wenn wir die Ursachen und Eigenarten von Leseschwierigkeiten
ergruenden wollen, erweisen sich solche Experimente wie alle anderen,
die auf der Praemisse der Schriftlichkeit beruhen, als untauglich.

Derartige Untersuchungen bestaetigen eigentlich nur, dass es heutzutage
selbst unter Schuelern und Studenten viel weniger Gemeinsamkeiten gibt
als zu jener Zeit, in der sich das Schreiben und Lesen herausbildete.
Die Diversifikation unserer Erfahrung vor dem Hintergrund einer
relativ stabilen Sprache, die als allgemeiner Kulturstandard
vorausgesetzt wird, sollte uns veranlassen, eben diese Beziehung zur
Erklaerung der vorliegenden Daten und auch zur Erklaerung der
urspruenglichen Fragestellung heranzuziehen.  Warum in den
zurueckliegenden Jahren das Lesen, Verstehen und Erinnern von
geschriebener Sprache trotz der vermehrten Anstrengungen von Schule,
Elternhaeusern, Arbeitgebern und Ministerien immer mehr zum Problem
geworden ist, weiss niemand zu sagen.  Wie sehr wir uns auch immer
bemuehen, das Verstaendnis eines Textes durch die Verwendung von
Bildern zu erhoehen, die Notwendigkeit von Texten als Ausdruck einer
schriftkulturellen praktischen Erfahrung ist damit keineswegs
gesteigert.  Zu solchen Ergebnissen kommen wir nicht leichtfertig,
denn wir sind noch immer durch die Schriftkultur konditioniert.
Jenseits solcher Konditionierungszwaenge stellen sich andere
Erfahrungsinhalte ganz natuerlich ein.  So erklaert sich auch, warum im
Internet der Tenor des sozialen und politischen Dialogs viel
vorurteilsfreier ist als das, was wir in Buechern, Zeitungen und
Fernsehsendungen vermittelt bekommen.  Das ist nicht als eine neue
Form von technologischem Determinismus zu verstehen.  Mir geht es um
die neuen pragmatischen Umstaende, nicht um die darin eingebundenen
Mittel.

Vermutlich hat Korzybski recht, wenn er sagt, Sprache sei "eine Karte,
die das verzeichnet, was sich in uns und ausserhalb von uns abspielt."
Angesichts des Entwicklungsstandes, den unsere Zivilisation
erreicht hat, ist keine der bislang gezeichneten Karten genau genug.
Wenn wir die fuer die gegenwaertige und zukuenftige Entwicklung
wesentlichen Einzelheiten abbilden wollen, muessen wir die Veraenderung
in der Metrik (d. h. in der Skala der verzeichneten Einheit) und in
der Dynamik beruecksichtigen.  Die Welt veraendert sich, weil wir uns
veraendern, und damit eroeffnen wir der Welt neue Dimensionen.

Wenn wir AEhnlichkeiten mit vergangenen Stadien erkennen--also etwa
dem der Muendlichkeit--, gewinnen sie nur dann Bedeutung, wenn wir sie
im angemessenen Kontext betrachten.  Die moderne Technologie hat die
Probleme, die mit der langsamen Geschwindigkeit der Schallwellen
zusammenhingen, geloest und die muendliche Kommunikation ueber weite
Entfernungen hinweg (Telekommunikation) zu einer einfachen
Angelegenheit gemacht.  In frueheren Zeiten konnten Personen auf zwei
benachbarten Huegeln sich entweder besuchen, sich zurufen oder Feuer-
und Lichtsignale senden.  Heute koennen wir mit jemandem sprechen, der
gerade in einem Flugzeug sitzt, im Auto faehrt, spazierengeht oder den
Mount Everest besteigt.  Auf diese Weise sind wir ueber die
Telefontechnologie ueberall auf der Welt so genau zu orten wie durch
das in Satelliten installierte Global Positioning System (GPS).  Das
Telefon als neues Medium der Muendlichkeit eruebrigt jede Form der
physischen Praesenz und kann praktisch ueberall aktiviert werden.  Auf
diese Weise wurde die heutige Kommunikation revolutioniert und
Muendlichkeit in einem global wirkenden, komplexen und kontrollierten
Handlungsrahmen wiederbelebt und mit neuen Funktionen versehen.  Im
digitalen Netzwerk, das zunehmend zu unserem Medium der
Selbstkonstituierung geworden ist, sind wir gleichzeitig Absender und
Adresse.  Mit einem Tastendruck sind wir, wo immer wir sein wollen,
was wir sein wollen und was wir zu tun vermoegen.  Mit einem weiteren
Tastendruck werden wir zum Gegenstand der Interessen, Handlungen,
Nachfragen eines anderen.  Die Verwendung von Bildern gehoert in
diesen weiten Rahmen, ebenso das allgegenwaertige und, wie es manchmal
scheint, allmaechtige Fernsehen.  Das hat uns mit der gesamten Welt
verbunden; zugleich aber haben wir die Bindung an uns selbst verloren.
Die Bandbreite fuer Interaktionen durch eine Vielfalt von Kanaelen
hat sich vom Kupferdraht auf Glasfiber-Datenautobahnen ausgeweitet
und damit eine Struktur geschaffen, die unsere Koordinaten in einer
Welt der global ausgelegten Handlungsraeume neu definiert.  Wir setzen
die physikalischen Gesetze ausser Kraft und sind gleichzeitig an
mehreren Orten.  Wir koennen auch gleichzeitig mehr als nur eine
Person sein.  Das Verstehen von Sprache wird unter solchen
veraenderten Umstaenden zu einer gaenzlich neuen Erfahrung unserer
Selbstkonstituierung.

Dennoch bedeutet das Verstehen von Sprache immer noch, diejenigen zu
verstehen, die sich durch Sprache ausdruecken, gleich welches Medium
sie dafuer verwenden.  Die Schriftkultur ermoeglichte es, die Sprache
eines Zivilisationsstadiums zu verstehen, dessen Skala der linearen
Natur des Schreibens und Lesens und der in der Sprache angelegten
Wahrheitslogik entsprach.  Gleichwohl weist Schrift keine
heuristischen Dimensionen auf, ist langsam und ermoeglicht nur
begrenzt Interaktivitaet.  Das Irrationale unterwirft sie der
Rationalitaet und unser gesamtes Leben ihrer buerokratischen Sorge.
Eine allen gemeinsame Erfahrung in einem begrenzten Lebensrahmen, wie
sie fuer die Anfaenge der Sprachnotation charakteristisch war,
erleichtert die Interpretation.  Divergente Erfahrungen, die dem
Streben nach Nuetzlichkeit, Effizienz, Vermittlung entspringen und
weniger Gemeinsames aufweisen, bringen es mit sich, dass die Sprache
unserer Selbstkonstituierung in geringerem Masse entspricht und daher
auch schwerer zu verstehen ist.  So gesehen macht die Schriftkultur
alles, was sie umfasst, gleichfoermig; deshalb widersetzt man sich ihr.
Sie ist alles andere als eine blosse Fertigkeit; sie ist gemeinsame
Erfahrung, die sich in der Arbeit und im sozialen Leben einstellte.
Veraenderungen des pragmatischen Rahmens fuehrten zu der Einsicht, dass
Schriftkultur sehr wohl dazu dienen koennte, Bruecken zwischen den
verschiedenen fragmentarisierten Wissens- und Erfahrungsbereichen zu
schlagen, nicht aber, diese zu verkoerpern.  Sie koennte sich durchaus
noch darauf auswirken, wie wir Sondersprachen als Instrumente fuer
unsere verschiedenen Zugriffe auf die Welt, fuer unsere
Veraenderungsversuche und fuer die Darstellung der Ergebnisse solcher
Versuche verwenden.  Daraus folgt indes noch lange nicht, dass
Schriftkultur der einzig heilbringende Loesungsweg fuer Ausdruck,
Kommunikation und Bedeutung bleiben wird oder bleiben sollte.



Kapitel 4:


Die Funktionsweise der Sprache

Funktionieren ist ein Verb, das aus dem Umgang mit Maschinen
abgeleitet ist.  Von Maschinen erwarten wir eine gleichbleibende
Leistung in einem bestimmten Bereich.  Wenn wir diesen Begriff
metaphorisch auf die Sprache anwenden, sollte uns bewusst bleiben, dass
Sprache aus menschlicher Interaktion erwaechst, die mit
Zeichensystemen zu tun hat, besonders mit jenen, die schliesslich in
der Schriftkultur gipfelten.  Folgende Probleme sollen behandelt
werden: wir wollen die Sprachfunktionen benennen, die sich in
verschiedenen pragmatischen Zusammenhaengen abzeichnen; die Prozesse
vergleichen, in denen diese Funktionen ausgeuebt werden; und die
pragmatischen Umstaende beschreiben, unter denen bestimmte
Funktionsmechanismen die Praxis nicht mehr mit der Effizienz
unterstuetzen, die die Skala des pragmatischen Rahmens eigentlich
erfordert.


Ausdruck, Kommunikation, Bedeutung

UEblicherweise werden Sprachfunktionen entweder mit Gehirntaetigkeit
assoziiert oder ueber den Bereich menschlicher Interaktion definiert.
Im ersten Fall wird Sprachverstehen, Sprachproduktion, Lese-,
Aussprache- und Schreibfaehigkeit untersucht.  Durch nicht-invasive
Methoden versucht der Neuropsychologe aufzuzeigen, wie Erinnerung und
Sprachfunktionen mit dem Gehirn zusammenhaengen.  Im zweiten Fall
liegt das Augenmerk auf sozialen und kommunikativen Funktionen, mit
zunehmendem Interesse an unterliegenden Aspekten (die oft an
Computermodellen durchgespielt werden).  Mein Ansatz dagegen verlegt
die Sprachfunktionen in den Bereich der praktischen Erfahrung, in die
Pragmatik der menschlichen Spezies.  Sprachfunktionen werden
zuallererst durch Zeichenprozesse verkoerpert.

In einem vorsprachlichen Zustand funktionierten Zeichen auf der
Grundlage ihrer ontogenetischen Bedingungen.  Es waren
zurueckgelassene Markierungen--Fusseindruecke, Blut aus einer Wunde,
Bissabdruecke--, die nur in dem Mass Assoziationen erlaubten, in dem
Individuen ihre Entstehung erfuhren oder nachvollzogen.  Das Erkennen
solcher Zeichen fuehrte zu einfachen Assoziationsmustern wie Aktion
und Reaktion, Ursache und Wirkung.  Die Erfahrung, dass ein Biss einen
Abdruck hinterlaesst, ist ein Beispiel dafuer.  Hinweise auf Gegenstaende
(abgebrochene Zweige am Weg, Obsidiansplitter an Stellen, an denen
Steine bearbeitet worden waren, zurueckgebliebene Asche) und Symptome
(von Staerke oder Schwaeche) sind weniger unmittelbar, aber ebenfalls
noch ohne jegliche Intentionalitaet.  Die nichtintentionale
Zeichenerfahrung fand mit der Nachahmung ein Ende.  Bei nachahmenden
Zeichen, die dem Dargestellten aehnlich sein sollen, wird das Zeichen
nicht einfach zurueckgelassen, sondern gezielt geschaffen mit dem
Zweck, mit anderen geteilt zu werden, also mit-zu-teilen.

Die Funktion, die am besten das Zeichen als Hinweis auf seinen
Verursacher definiert, ist die Ausdrucksfunktion.  Die
Kommunikationsfunktion bringt Individuen ueber die Erfahrung zusammen,
an der sie teilnehmen.  Die Bedeutungsfunktion schliesslich entspricht
einer Erfahrung, die Zeichen zum Gegenstand hat und auf der
symbolischen Ebene operiert.  Diese Funktion versieht das Zeichen mit
dem Gedaechtnis, das den Prozess seiner Hervorbringung in der
Lebenspraxis einschliesst.  Die Bedeutungsfunktion verweist auf die
selbstreflexive Dimension von Zeichen.  Ausdruck und Kommunikation,
vor allem aber Bedeutung unterscheiden sich in unterschiedlichen
pragmatischen Handlungsrahmen erheblich.

Ausdrucksformen sind gewissermassen Gleichnisse fuer individuelle
Eigenschaften und persoenliche Erfahrung, sie koennen als UEbersetzung
dieser Eigenschaften und der Erfahrung, die sie hervorbringt,
betrachtet werden.  Ein grosser Fussabdruck verweist auf einen grossen
Fuss und bestimmt innerhalb einer begrenzten Erfahrungsskala das
lebenswichtige Resultat einer Handlung.  Die Ausdrucksformen der
gesprochenen Sprache sind durch die Gegenwaertigkeit der
Kommunikationspartner gekennzeichnet, deren gemeinsame Raum- und
Zeiterfahrung durch Versicherungen wie hier und jetzt ausgedrueckt
wird.  In der Schrift ist die Ausdrucksform an die aeusseren Merkmale
des Schreiben-Koennens gebunden.  Daher schliesst die Graphologie auch
von den aeusseren Erscheinungsmustern auf psychologische Eigenschaften
des Schreibers.  Die Schriftkultur ist jedoch an derartigen
Ausdrucksformen wenig interessiert, wenngleich sie dazu beitraegt und
natuerlich der Graphologie als Medium dient.  Die Schriftkultur
foerdert Normen und Erwartungen bezueglich des korrekten Schreibens.
Diejenigen, die diese Normen verinnerlichen, wissen, dass innerhalb
einer auf Schriftkultur beruhenden Praxis die Effizienz der
Selbstkonstituierung ganz wesentlich durch eine gleichfoermige
Arbeits- und Lebenspraxis erhoeht wird.

Fuer die Kommunikations- und Bedeutungsfunktion gilt das gleiche.
Gemeinsam ist ihnen eine aufsteigende Skala: Bezeichnungen fuer
Verwandtschaft, fuer groessere Gruppen, Kollektivbezeichnungen,
schliesslich kraftvolle Ausdruecke, wenn sich der Aktionsradius
erweitert und Individuen allmaehlich mit ihren individualisierenden
Merkmalen negiert werden.  Bei der Kommunikation wird das noch
deutlicher.  Familienmitglieder zusammenzubringen ist leichter, als
Staemme, Gemeinden, Staedte, Laender usw. oder gar die ganze Welt
zusammenzufuehren.  Da aber verfuegbare Ressourcen nicht
notwendigerweise mit erhoehten Bevoelkerungszahlen und schon gar nicht
mit wachsenden Beduerfnissen und Erwartungen Schritt halten, ist es
entscheidend, kognitive Ressourcen in die Erfahrungen der
Selbstkonstituierung zu integrieren.  Die an Zeichensysteme gebundene
Kommunikationsfunktion erreichte mit den Mitteln der Schriftkultur
ihre bis dahin hoechste Entwicklung.  Neue Erweiterungen der Skala
werden neue Effizienzerwartungen mit sich bringen und damit indirekt
einen Bedarf an neuen Mitteln, die diesen Erwartungen gerecht werden.
Veraenderungen--wie der Schritt von vorsprachlichen zu sprachlichen
Zeichensystemen, von Muendlichkeit zu Schriftlichkeit, von der
Schriftkultur zu einem Stadium jenseits davon--finden immer nur dann
statt, wenn die praktischen Erfahrungen komplexer werden und neue
kognitive Ressourcen erschliessen.  Mit anderen Worten: Wenn die
Sprache die Lebenspraxis nicht mehr so traegt, dass die der gegebenen
Skala entsprechende Effizienz erreicht wird, werden neue Formen des
Ausdrucks, der Kommunikation und des Bedeutens notwendig.

Unser Thema, die zeitliche Bedingtheit eines jeden Zeichensystems,
besonders das der Muendlichkeit und der Schriftkultur, ist von diesen
UEberlegungen in zweifacher Hinsicht betroffen:
1. Sie zeigen, dass die grundlegenden Sprachfunktionen (Ausdruck,
Kommunikation, Bedeutung) von pragmatischen Lebenszusammenhaengen
abhaengig sind;
2. Sie zeigen Bedingungen auf, unter denen neue Mittel und Methoden
mit groesserer Effizienz diejenigen ergaenzen oder uebertreffen, die in
zurueckliegenden Praxiszusammenhaengen entstanden waren.
Wir haben im einzelnen zeigen koennen, wie Lebenspraxis,
Selbstkonstituierung und Identitaetsbildung in der
Menschheitsentwicklung einhergingen mit der Entwicklung von immer
differenzierteren und abstrakteren Zeichensystemen, die schliesslich
in der Schriftkultur und den aus ihr hervorgehenden Errungenschaften
im Produktionsbereich, im sozialen, politischen und kuenstlerischen
Leben sowie in Bildung und Freizeit gipfelten.

Die Entwicklung von Sprachen auf noch hoeheren Ebenen und von Mitteln
zur Visualisierung, Animation, Simulation und Modellierung bringt
heutzutage weitere Veraenderungen mit sich.  Wir werden ihre Bedeutung
fuer unser Leben jedoch nicht verstehen koennen, wenn wir uns nicht
vergegenwaertigen, was sie notwendig gemacht hat.  Das heisst, wir
muessen uns wieder mit dem Menschen und seiner dynamischen Entfaltung
befassen.  Dazu muessen wir zuallererst die Beziehung zwischen der
Struktur der Kultur, innerhalb derer Zeichensysteme, Schriftkultur
und Bildung und darueber hinausgehende Mittel zu identifizieren sind,
und der Struktur der Gesellschaft, innerhalb derer sich die
Interaktion zwischen den einzelnen Mitgliedern dieser Gesellschaft
vollzieht, verstehen.  Ansonsten geben Erklaerungsmodelle jedweder Art
keinen Sinn.  Wir gehen von folgender Voraussetzung aus: Da nicht
einmal die Vaeter des behavioristischen Modells davon ausgingen, dass
die Urspruenge unseres Verhaltens in uns selbst liegen (Skinner hat
das in einem Interview kurz vor seinem Tod noch einmal dargelegt),
duerfen wir die zu einer Gemeinschaft findenden Individuen als Ort
menschlicher Interaktion definieren.  Dabei wirkt Sprache lediglich
als eine Integrationskraft unter anderen.  Wir haben gesehen, wie der
UEbergang vom Natur- zum Kulturzustand, der seinen Hoehepunkt in der
Schriftkultur erreichte, einen Wechsel in der Welterfahrung und im
Verhaeltnis des Menschen zur Welt bewirkte.  Heute sehen wir uns einem
Umbruch ausgesetzt, der auf eine Lebensform jenseits der
Schriftkultur hinsteuert--gekennzeichnet durch vielfaeltige Schichten
der Vermittlung und Vermitteltheit, Konfiguration, Nichtlinearitaet,
Aufgabenverteilung und durch Meta-Sprache.  In diesem Prozess
veraendert sich die Funktionsweise der Sprache ebenso wie der Mensch,
der sich in grundlegend neuen Erfahrungszusammenhaengen und
Praxisformen neu konstituiert.


Die Gedankenmaschine

Das Funktionieren der Sprache kann weder in Rotationen pro Sekunde
oder in verarbeiteten Rohstoffmengen noch mit unseren neuen
Masseinheiten von Bits, Bytes, Flops und dergleichen ausgedrueckt
werden.  Die Produkte der Sprache (um in der Maschinenmetapher zu
bleiben) sind Ausdrucksformen, Informationsaustausch und Wertungen.
Noch wichtiger aber ist ein anderes Produkt, das den kognitiven
Aspekt menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung bestimmt: Gedanken und
Vorstellungen.

Wir haben gezeigt, wie sich Sprache von ihrer Bindung an individuelle
Erfahrung losloeste, wie diese Entwicklung Interaktionsformen und
Handlungsmuster beeinflusste und wie sich schliesslich die
verschiedenen Notationsformen aus einer erweiterten Erfahrungs- und
Interaktionsskala heraus zur Schrift hin entwickelten, die ihrerseits
einen ganzen Satz von linearen Konventionen bewirkte.

Die Umstaende, die das Entwickeln und Verstehen von Gedanken
ermoeglicht haben, liessen den Menschen als einzigartige Spezies unter
allen Lebewesen hervortreten.  Gedanken, wie komplex sie auch
ausfallen, beziehen sich auf Weltzustaende: auf die physische,
biologische oder raeumliche Wirklichkeit, die in der
Selbstkonstituierung des Individuums verkoerpert ist.  Sie beziehen
sich ferner auf die Geisteszustaende derer, die die Gedanken
formulieren.  Gedanken sind Symptome der menschlichen
Selbstkonstituierung und damit zugleich der Sprachen, die die
Menschen in der Praxis entwickelt haben.  Wir wollen der Frage
nachgehen, ob zwischen Schriftkultur und dem Entwickeln und Verstehen
von Gedanken ein innerer Zusammenhang besteht oder ob Gedanken auch
auf andere als schriftsprachliche Weise, etwa in Zeichnungen oder den
heutigen multimedialen Systemen formuliert und verstanden werden
koennen.

Die Menschen druecken sich durch ihre Zeichensysteme nicht nur anderen
gegenueber aus, sie hoeren sich auch zu und blicken sich an.  Sie sind
gleichzeitig Sender und Empfaenger.  Beim Sprechen folgen die Zeichen
in einer Serie von selbstkontrollierten Abfolgen aufeinander.  Neue
Ausdrucksformen entstehen (Synthese), indem das verfuegbare Wissen auf
eine neue, den neuen lebenspraktischen Erfahrungen angemessene Weise
geordnet wird; dieser Prozess unterliegt der bestaendigen
Selbstkontrolle.

Praeverbale und subverbale unartikulierte Sprachen (auf der
Signalebene von Geruch, Beruehrung, Geschmack oder die kinetischen und
proxemischen Sprachtypen) definieren Empfindungen unmittelbar bzw.
ueber rudimentaere Kontexte.  Das Verhaeltnis von artikulierter Sprache
zu unartikulierten subverbalen Sprachen zeigt sich auf der Ebene der
natuerlichen wie auch der soziokulturellen Taetigkeiten.  Hierfuer ein
Beispiel: Unter den Bedingungen, die allmaehlich zur Sprache
hinfuehrten, war das Olfaktorische als Geschmackskontrolle in seiner
Bedeutung Sehen und Gehoer vergleichbar.  Dies aenderte sich, als an
die Stelle der unmittelbaren Erfahrung die sprachlich vermittelte
Erfahrung trat.  Im lebenspraktischen Zusammenhang der Schriftkultur
verlor der Geruchssinn gaenzlich an Bedeutung.  Biologische
Kommunikationsformen wurden eingeschraenkt, immaterielle, nicht an
Substanzen gebundene Kommunikation nahm im gleichen Masse zu.  Gewiss
koennen Gedanken im strengen Wortsinn nicht durch Geruch ausgedrueckt
werden.  Dennoch beeinflussen Geruchs-, Geschmacks- und andere
Sinneserfahrungen Bereiche der Lebenspraxis, die jenseits von
Schriftlichkeit liegen.


Schrift und der Ausdruck von Gedanken

Als das Sprechzeichen ein Sprachzeichen (Alphabet, Woerter, Saetze)
wurde, gewann der oben skizzierte Prozess an Tiefe.  Das konkrete
(geschriebene, stabilisierte) Zeichen leistete seinen Beitrag bei der
Verallgemeinerung von Erfahrung--mittels der Abstraktheit seiner
Linien, Formen und Verknuepfungen, Ton, Wachs und Pergament oder
irgend einem anderen Traeger.  Die Abfolge individueller Zeichen
(Buchstaben, Woerter) verwandelte sich in das Zeichen fuer das
Allgemeine.  Jahrhundertelang war die Schrift nur ein Behaelter fuer
Sprache, nicht operationelle Sprache.  Damit widersprechen wir nicht
der noch immer umstrittenen Sapir-Whorf-Hypothese von der
Beeinflussung des Denkens durch die Sprache.  Wir wollen lediglich
klarstellen, dass der aktive Einfluss auf das Denken nicht unmittelbar
von der Sprache, sondern von einer Abfolge von praktischen
Erfahrungen ausging.  Haette es ein Geraet gegeben, die muendliche
Sprache aufzuzeichnen, dann haette die Verwendung von Schrift und die
Notwendigkeit von Schriftkultur ziemlich sicher andere Formen
angenommen.

Die Menschen gehen mit Zeichensystemen nicht um wie mit Maschinen
oder mit irgendwelchen Teilen, die man ansammelt und weglegt.  Sie
waren stets ihre eigenen Skripte und vollzogen in Form von Notationen
tatsaechliche oder moegliche Erfahrungen.  Das hebraeische Alphabet
begann als Kurzschrift aus Konsonanten, die die Schreiber als
Wortwurzeln auf Pergament brachten.  Fuer die begrenzte Skala und
gemeinsame Lebenspraxis reichte diese Kurzschrift voellig aus.  Die
Hieroglyphen der Maya, die mesopotamischen Ideogramme und alle
anderen uns bekannten Notationen verfolgten denselben Zweck: Hinweise
zu geben, damit andere die Sprache wiederaufleben lassen konnten.
Eine erweiterte Skala und weniger homogene Erfahrungen veranlassten
die hebraeischen Schreiber, diakritische Zeichen zur Andeutung von
Vokalen zu ergaenzen.  Ebenso veraenderte sich die Schrift der
Mesopotamier und Sumerer mit veraenderten pragmatischen Rahmen.

Dass das Schreiben zu den Erfahrungen menschlicher
Selbstkonstituierung gehoert, die sich in der Struktur der Gedanken
widerspiegelt, koennte ohne einen Blick auf die biologische Komponente
vielleicht nicht ueberzeugen.  Derrick de Kerkhove hat darauf
hingewiesen, dass alle von rechts nach links geschriebenen Sprachen
nur Konsonanten verwenden.  Die kognitiven Lesemechanismen, die man
zu ihrer Entzifferung braucht, unterscheiden sich also von denen, die
man zur Entzifferung von Sprachen mit Vokalen benoetigt, die von links
nach rechts geschrieben werden.  Als die Griechen die urspruenglich
konsonantischen Alphabete der Phoenizier und Hebraeer uebernahmen,
ergaenzten sie diese um Vokale und veraenderten die
Schriftrichtung--zunaechst in Form des pflugartig in beide Richtungen
verlaufenden Bustrophedon.  Spaeter dann bekam die Schrift ihre
gleichfoermige Richtung, die einer auf Sequentialitaet ausgerichteten
kognitiven Struktur entsprach.  Dementsprechend veraenderte sich die
Funktionsweise der griechischen Sprache.  Die im Kontext der
vorsokratischen und sokratischen Dialoge stehenden Gedanken haben
einen deutlich deduktiven, spekulativen Charakter im Gegensatz zum
analytischen Diskurs der schriftlich verfassten spaeteren griechischen
Philosophie.

Der Zusammenhang von Denkstruktur und Schriftstruktur laesst sich auch
an den Vorurteilen gegenueber der Linkshaendigkeit ablesen, die in
vielen Sprachen und den von ihnen geformten Denkweisen verbreitet
sind.  Rechts (Hand und Richtung) scheint eindeutig bevorzugt zu sein:
Wir bezeichnen Dinge als richtig (englisch right), im Deutschen sind
Recht und Richter etymologisch damit verwandt; wir erledigen Dinge
mit der rechten Hand und bevorzugen die rechte Seite.  Vorstellungen
von dem, was richtig oder gerecht ist, die Menschenrechte und vieles
andere stehen in diesem etymologischen Zusammenhang.  In unseren von
Rechts beherrschten Denk- und Handlungsweisen ist dementsprechend die
linke Hand negativ konnotiert mit Schwaeche, Unfaehigkeit und sogar
Suende.  (Beim Juengsten Gericht muessen die Suender zur Linken Gottes
stehen.) Der in diesen Verhaeltnissen zum Ausdruck kommende
Symbolismus wuerde eine naehere Untersuchung verdienen; in unserem
Zusammenhang ist es indes interessant zu vermerken, dass die Dominanz
des Rechten in Schrift, Schriftkultur und Bildung verblasst.  Die
Effizienz einer auf dieser Norm gruendenden Praxis reicht nicht mehr
aus, um den an globale Handlungsraeume gerichteten
Effizienzerwartungen zu genuegen.  Dieser Prozess steht im Zusammenhang
mit allgemeinen Erfahrungen, in denen Schrift zunehmend durch viele
Teilschriften ersetzt wird, die ein Stadium jenseits der
Schriftkultur kennzeichnen.

Da Gedanken im Akt des Sprechens entstehen, haengt ihre Verbreitung
und Bewertung von der Tragbarkeit des Mediums ab, in dem sie
ausgedrueckt werden.  Mit dem Aufkommen der Schrift war die
Verbreitung der Sprache nicht mehr an die Mobilitaet ihrer Sprecher
gebunden.  Die in der Schrift ausgedrueckten Gedanken konnten
ausserhalb ihres Entstehungszusammenhangs geprueft werden.  Damit
fallen die Funktion der Verbreitung durch Sprache und der Bewertung
in der Lebenspraxis zusammen.  Einer Tafel, einer Papyrusrolle, einem
Kodex, einem Buch oder einem digitalen Vergleich ist gemeinsam, dass
sie praktische Erfahrungen aufzeichnen; aber nicht das, was ihnen
gemein ist, erklaert ihre Effizienz, sondern die in den gegebenen
Zusammenhaengen gefundene Verbreitungsform, die in der alles
durchdringenden und global praesenten Form der digitalen Aufzeichnung
ihren vorlaeufigen Hoehepunkt gefunden hat.  Fuer den Zugang zum in den
elektronischen Netzwerken gespeicherten Wissen benoetigen wir nichts
weiter als ein Password.  Damit loesen wir uns von den bekannten
Raumund Zeitkoordinaten.  In diesen erweiterten Parametern kann die
Schiftkultur nicht mehr alle Erwartungen erfuellen.  Der Bereich, in
dem sich die Alternativen zur Schriftkultur herausbilden, begruendet
das Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur.


Zukunft und Vergangenheit

Muessen wir schriftkulturell gebildet sein, um die Zukunft behandeln
zu koennen?  Und umgekehrt, ist Geschichte und Geschichtsverstaendnis
das Ergebnis von Schriftlichkeit?  Und ist beides Voraussetzung fuer
das Verstaendnis der Gegenwart?  Diese Fragen beschaeftigen uns heute
mehr denn je.  Wir wollen uns zunaechst der Zukunft zuwenden, denn an
dieser Frage koennen wir ablesen, welche Voraussetzungen fuer die
Auseinandersetzung mit ihr gegeben sein muessen.

Vorahnung ist die natuerliche Form einer diffusen Zeiterfahrung.
Diese Erfahrung kann mehr oder weniger unmittelbar sein.  Sie richtet
sich nicht vom Jetzt auf das Gewesene (wie es vielleicht im
Gedaechtnis gespeichert ist), sondern auf das Moegliche (etwas ein
Zeichen bevorstehender Gefahr in der natuerlichen Umwelt).
Hinweisende Zeichen, d. h. indexikalische Zeichen, solcher Art sind
Fussabdruecke, Federn, Blutflecken.  Sprache macht Vorahnung und Gefuehl
explizit, wenn auch nicht vollkommen.  Sie uebertraegt akkumulierte
Zeichen (Vergangenheit) in eine Sprache des Moeglichen (Zukunft).
Wenn wir die Vergangenheit rekonstruieren, erkennen wir, dass jedes
Vergangenheitsstadium einmal eine Zukunft gewesen ist.

Wenn wir bedenken, wie sich unsere Gegenwart in die Zukunft hinein
entfaltet, dann sehen wir schnell, dass mit zunehmenden Moeglichkeiten
die Zukunft in ihren Einzelheiten immer weniger bestimmt und
bestimmbar wird.  Weder die unkritischen Befuerworter der neuen
Technologien, noch die ausschliesslich in der Schriftkultur
verhafteten Politiker und Paedagogen haben das begriffen.  Beide
Gruppen verstehen offenbar nicht, wie sich Zukunft in unserer
Sprache--oder einem anderen Zeichensystem--in Form von Plaenen,
Vorhersagen oder Antizipationen artikuliert.

Jeder Gedanke drueckt eine praktische Erfahrung und die kognitive
Leistung aus, den direkten Eindruck zu verallgemeinern.  Einmalige
Artikulationen auf der Signalebene und ideographische Schrift
erwachsen aus Erfahrungen, die auf der pragmatisch-affektiven
Existenzebene liegen.  Rufe und Schreie oder in Bildern ausgedrueckte
AEhnlichkeiten tragen keine Gedanken und gehen kaum ueber die
unmittelbare Empfindung hinaus.  Gedanken ergeben sich aus der
Erfahrung auf der pragmatisch-rationalen Ebene.  Sprache kann dabei
als Medium dienen, Plaene explizit zu machen.  Zeichnungen, Diagramme,
Modelle und Simulationen koennen durch Sprache beschrieben werden.
Bevor die Menschen ihre Zukunft verschriftlicht haben, haben sie sie
versprachlicht, und zwar auch mithilfe anderer Zeichen: mit
Koerperbewegungen, Gegenstaenden, die Gefahr und damit Furcht andeuten,
und erfolgreichen Handlungen, die Zufriedenheit signalisieren.  Mit
der UEbertragung auf Tontafeln und Papyrus erhielt die auf die Zukunft
gerichtete Sprache einen anderen Status--sie verlor die Fluechtigkeit
der urspruenglichen Laute und Gesten.  Schrift begleitet Handlung und
ueberdauert die darin gemachte Erfahrung.  Damit umgab das
geschriebene Wort eine Aura, die Laute, Gesten oder auch Kunstgebilde
nie erlangen konnten.  Auch Wiederholungsmuster, das wesentliche
Strukturmerkmal von Ritualen, vermochten nicht in dem Masse wie die
Schrift die Empfindung von Dauerhaftigkeit zu vermitteln.  Gordon
Childe stellt in diesem Zusammenhang fest: "Die Verewigung des Wortes
in der Schrift muss als uebernatuerlicher Prozess empfunden worden sein;
es musste magisch anmuten, dass ein laengst Verstorbener noch immer von
einer Tontafel oder einer Papyrusrolle sprechen konnte."

Im religioesen Zusammenhang verlagert sich die Aura vom
Magisch-Mythischen (uebermittelte Hinweise fuer erfolgreiches Handeln)
zum Mystischen (eine uebernatuerliche Autoritaet als Hinweisquelle).
Auch die Organisation des gesellschaftlichen Lebens erwies sich ohne
Dokumente mit Vorschriftscharakter als wenig effektiv.  Die ersten
ueberlieferten Dokumente aus dem alten China tragen dieser Einsicht
Rechnung, gleiches gilt fuer Hindu, Hebraeer und Griechen sowie fuer
viele nachfolgende, oft am Roemischen Imperium orientierten
Zivilisationen.

Natuerlich setzt die Verwendung von Sprache fuer die Regelung des
Gemeinwesens nicht zwangslaeufig Schriftlichkeit voraus.  Dies gilt
fuer Vergangenheit und Gegenwart.  Es gab Zeiten, in denen man nur von
Fremden den Erwerb von Schreib- und Lesekenntnissen erwartete.  Dem
lag eine praktische Einsicht zugrunde: der Fremde fand auf diese
Weise Zugang zu den ihm ungewohnten Sitten der einheimischen
Bevoelkerung.  Mit der Abgabe von Versprechen--die sich ja stets auf
Zukuenftiges richten--wurde das soziale Leben zunehmend
verschriftlicht, wenngleich auch dann die Besiegelung oft muendlich
erfolgte, wie die Eidesformeln und -gesten bis in die heutige Zeit
zeigen.  Mit all dem wurden lineare Beziehungen von Ursache und
Wirkung festgehalten und als Massstab (der Rationalitaet) in die
Zukunft projiziert.

In unserer heutigen Gesellschaft wird die fuer die Vergangenheit
charakteristische Sprache als Dekorum verwendet.  Eine globale Skala
und die gesellschaftliche Komplexitaet finden in linearen Beziehungen
nicht mehr ihren angemessenen Ausdruck.  Infolgedessen ist die
Schriftlichkeit der Schriftkultur zukuenftig nicht nur eine unter
vielen anderen Sprachen, sondern vielleicht sogar ungeeignet fuer die
effiziente Artikulation von Zukunftsplanungen.  Fast alle, die sich
heute mit solchen Planungen befassen, arbeiten mit mathematischen
Modellierungen und Computersimulation.  Die Arbeitsergebnisse
beanspruchen immer weniger Text und werden in dynamischen Modellen
abgebildet, die global verfuegbar sind.  An die Stelle von Linearitaet
treten nicht-lineare Beschreibungen der zahlreichen miteinander
verknuepften Faktoren.  Selbstkonfiguration, Parallelismus und
verteilte Strategien kommen zum Ausdruck bei Simulationen der Zukunft.

Die Geschichte allerdings hat ihren Ursprung eindeutig in der Schrift.
Sie ergibt sich aus der Beschaeftigung mit universell verfuegbaren
Aufzeichnungen, mithin innerhalb des Universums der Schriftkultur.
Wir wissen nicht, ob eine Grammatik die Sprache in ihrem
geschichtlichen Werden zusammenfassend darstellt oder das Programm
fuer ihre zukuenftige Verwendung entwirft.  Grammatiken gibt es in
verschiedenen Kontexten, offenbar weil der Mensch die einzelnen
Stimmen innerhalb einer Sprache verifizieren moechte.  Aus dem
gleichen Anlass gibt es Geschichtsdarstellungen: weniger um
irgendeiner historischen Groesse Gerechtigkeit widerfahren zu lassen,
als vielmehr um einen Zusammenhang aus den Quellen herzustellen, um
sie in einer Stimme sprechen zu lassen und den Zusammenhang zu
erschliessen, aus dem sie entstanden sind.

Die Zukunft und die Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen in neuen
pragmatischen Zusammenhaengen stehen in direkter Verbindung; die
Vergangenheit haengt indirekt mit der praktischen Erfahrung zusammen.
Das verbindende Element fuer die verschiedenen auf die Zukunft
gerichteten Perspektiven liegt in der neuen Erfahrung.  In
Ermangelung einer solchen verbindenden Perspektive wird
Geschichtsschreibung zum Selbstzweck, ungeachtet der Kraft, die von
Beispielen ausgeht.  Seit dem fruehen Mittelalter reichten
schriftliche Aufzeichnungen und die analytische Kraft der Sprache fuer
die Geschichtsschreibung und die Schaerfung des Geschichtsbewusstseins
aus.  Als sich die Methoden der Geschichtsforschung differenzierten,
moeglicherweise im Zusammenhang mit der Lebenspraxis, ergaben sich
neue Perspektiven.  Einige waren ganz praktisch ausgerichtet: Welche
Pflanzen wurden in primitiven Gesellschaftsformen verwendet?  Wie war
die Wasserversorgung geregelt?  Wie ging man mit den Toten um?
Andere hatten politische, ideologische oder kulturelle Grundlagen.
Aber in allen diesen aus der Lebenspraxis hervorgehenden Faellen
entzog sich die Geschichte mehr oder weniger den Beengungen der
Schriftkultur.

Spracharchaeologie, Anthropologie und besonders Palaeoanthropologie
sowie Computergeschichte sind nur einige Beispiele fuer neue Bereiche
der Geschichte und Geschichtsschreibung, die neue Formen jenseits der
Schriftkultur annehmen.  Sie sind gekennzeichnet durch neue
Arbeitsmittel wie Elektronenmikroskop, Computersimulation,
Modellierung kuenstlichen Lebens und Forschungsergebnisse zur
kuenstlichen Intelligenz oder Genetik.  Die Memetik untersucht die
Seinsform von Gedanken und deren Bewusstwerdung, sie bezieht sich auf
Vergangenheit und Zukunft.  Sie entwickelte sich aus der Genetik und
traegt die Kennzeichen eines Darwinschen Mechanismus.  Sie wurde zum
Schluesselbegriff fuer eine Generation, die ohne jeglichen
Geschichtsbezug war und sich nicht minder von einer Zukunft bedroht
sah, die allzu schnell auf sie hereinbrach.  Technologische
Umsetzungen der Memetik (das sogenannte memetic engineering oder die
Memetiktechnologie) bezeugen Effizienzerwartungen, die die Geschichte
des Zeitalters der Schriftkultur niemals beschaeftigte oder auch nur
anerkennen wollte.

Es sieht also ganz so aus, dass die relativierte Bedeutung der
Schriftkultur und der an sie geknuepften Ideale von Universalitaet,
Dauerhaftigkeit, Hierarchie und Determinismus und das gleichzeitig zu
verzeichnende Aufkommen vieler Schriftlichkeiten, mit den wiederum an
sie geknuepften Haltungen der Begrenztheit, Fluechtigkeit,
Dezentralisierung und des Indeterminismus parallel verlaufen zu der
abnehmenden Bedeutung von Geschichte und dem Aufkommen vieler
Spezial-(oder Teil-)geschichten.  Der Hypertext ersetzt den
diskursiven Text und ruft eine neue Welt von Verbindungen ins Leben.
Diese neuen Verknuepfungen zwischen genau definierten Bereichen der
historischen Aufzeichnung verweisen auf eine Realitaet, die sich der
fortlaufenden, zusammenhaengenden Darstellung einer einheitlichen
Geschichte entzieht; sie sind aber fuer die Gegenwart relevant.  Der
spezialisierte Historiker berichtet nicht einfach ueber die
Vergangenheit, sondern ueber jene spezifischen Aspekte der
menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung in der Vergangenheit, die fuer den
heutigen Erfahrungsrahmen bedeutsam sind.  Bisweilen scheint es, als
erfaenden wir die Vergangenheit stueckweise aufs Neue, nur um die
gegenwaertige Lebenspraxis zu unterstuetzen und das Bewusstsein von der
Gegenwart zu staerken.  Die Sequentialitaet und Linearitaet jenes
pragmatischen Rahmens, der Sprachen erst entstehen liess und zu einem
spaeteren Zeitpunkt Schriftkultur und Geschichtsbewusstsein notwendig
erforderte, sind nun durch Nicht-Sequentialitaet und nichtlineare
Beziehungen ersetzt, die auf die heutige Skala des menschlichen
Daseins besser zugeschnitten sind.  Sie erweisen sich zudem fuer die
komplexen Formen heutiger menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung als
besser geeignet.

Als Eintrag in einer Datenbank (von enormem Umfang) verbreitet die
Vergangenheit noch immer ihre romantische Aura, aber sie richtet sich
auf Gegenwart und Zukunft.  Eine Position ausserhalb der Schriftkultur,
wie sie sich zum Beispiel in der Unkenntnis der einen grossen
Erzaehlung (story) von der Geschichte (history) aeussert, resultiert
nicht aus Unkenntnis im Lesen und Schreiben.  Sie ist auch nicht auf
schlechte Geschichtslehrer oder Geschichtsbuecher zurueckzufuehren, wie
manche glauben.  Sie ergibt sich daraus, dass unsere neuen praktischen
Erfahrung der Selbstkonstituierung von den Erfahrungen der
Vergangenheit abgetrennt sind.


Wissen und Verstehen

Das Verhaeltnis von Wissen und Verstehen ist vermutlich einer der
wichtigsten Aspekte unserer gegenwaertigen Lebenspraxis.  Wir sind in
viele Taetigkeiten eingebunden, ohne die Ablaeufe wirklich zu verstehen.
Die e-mail erreicht uns und diejenigen, an die wir unsere
Nachrichten versenden, und die wenigsten verstehen, was sich dabei im
einzelnen abspielt.  Unser Postsystem war leichter zu verstehen.  Den
Weg einer e-mail-Nachricht zu bestimmen, ist fuer eine programmierte
Maschine trivial, fuer einen Menschen fast unmoeglich.  Mit zunehmender
Komplexitaet unserer Taetigkeiten nimmt die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass die
darin eingebundenen Menschen sie und die wirkenden Mechanismen
verstehen, rapide ab.  Dadurch wird die Effektivitaet der Taetigkeit
keineswegs geschmaelert.

Das gilt mittlerweile fuer eine ganze Reihe von Taetigkeiten in der
ausserhalb der Schriftkultur stehenden Lebenspraxis.  Trotz komplexer
diagnostischer Hilfsmittel ist--aufgrund spezifischer Eigenschaften
der zu vollziehenden Taetigkeit--der eine Arzt besser als der andere;
trotz Automatisierung vieler Bereiche des Berufslebens--Buchfuehrung,
Steuererklaerung, Design und Architektur--fuehren irgendwelche Merkmale
der zu verrichtenden Taetigkeiten dazu, dass die Leistung bestimmter
Menschen besser ist als die fortschrittlichste Technologie.  Obwohl
manche Manager nahezu nichts von den Produkten ihrer Firma verstehen,
kennen sie die Marktgesetze so gut, dass ihre Arbeit stets mit Erfolg
gekroent ist, was immer sie auch vermarkten.  Diese Manager bewegen
sich im Erfahrungsraum einer Sprache--der Sprache des Marktes, nicht
des Produktes.  Wir wollen uns daher die Evolution von Wissen und
Verstehen im Rahmen verschiedener aufeinander folgender pragmatischer
Handlungsrahmen etwas naeher anschauen, insbesondere die Rolle, die
die Sprache als vermittelndes Element in jedem dieser Rahmen gespielt
hat.

Das Sprachzeichen besteht aus der kontradiktorischen Einheit von
phonetischen und semantischen Elementen.  Innerhalb einer begrenzten
Erfahrungsskala war Schriftkultur und Bildung gleichbedeutend mit dem
Wissen davon, was sich hinter einem Wort verbarg, mit der Faehigkeit,
es aufleben zu lassen oder gar, dem Wort neues Leben zu verleihen.
Mit der Erweiterung der Skala nahm man das, was sich hinter einem
Wort verbarg, als selbstverstaendlich und vorgegeben.  Das setzt
voraus, dass Woerterbuecher als Bestandsverzeichnisse unserer Sprache,
also auch die persoenlichen Woerterbuecher, kongruent sind.  Das
Erlernen einer Sprache beschraenkt sich nicht darauf, deren Ausdruecke
auswendig zu lernen.  Der einzig erfolgreiche Weg liegt darin, eine
Sprache zu leben.  Mit dem durch die Sprache erworbenen und
ausgedrueckten Wissen stellt sich Verstehen ein.

Der Mensch kommt nicht ohne Erfahrung auf die Welt.  Wichtige
Bestandteile der Erfahrung sind biologisch veranlagt.  Andere werden
durch bestaendige Interaktion vermittelt, besonders durch
gegenseitiges Verstehen.  Wir haben an der abnehmenden Bedeutung des
olfaktorischen Elements zeigen koennen, dass die Menschen durch die
evolutionaeren Zyklen bestimmt sind.  Mit dem Rueckgang der sinnlichen
Erfahrung verringerten sich auch die an die sinnliche Wahrnehmung
gebundenen Kenntnisse.  AEhnlich gilt, dass Sprachleistungen aus dem
Leben und Ausueben einer Sprache hervorgehen.  Das Existieren als
Sprache, die Anbindung des einzelnen an die Welt durch Sprache, ist
Voraussetzung dafuer, sie zu kennen und zu verstehen.  Die Sprache
unserer natuerlichen Umwelt ist nicht-verbal; sie artikuliert sich auf
der Ebene der elementaren, von aussen veranlassten Empfindungen, die
sich einstellen, wenn der Mensch seine Umwelt zu beherrschen oder
veraendern versucht.  Nach derartigen Erfahrungen erlebt der Mensch
die Welt als stabilisierte Bedeutung: Wolken koennen Regen ankuendigen,
Donner Feuer verursachen; fliehendes Wild verraet die Jaeger, Eier in
einem Nest deuten auf Voegel hin.  Die Komplexitaet unserer Bemuehungen,
die Welt zu meistern, nahm im Lauf unserer Entwicklung staendig zu.
So sind die Taetigkeiten in einem Lebensrahmen, der die Schriftkultur
entstehen liess, von einem anderen Komplexitaetsgrad als die der
Industriegesellschaft und die unserer heutigen Zeit.

Zwischen den Sinnen und der Sprache--und daher auch zwischen
nichtverbalen und verbalen Sprachen--sind zahlreiche Einfluesse
wirksam.  Woerter bringen kognitive Bedingungen mit sich, die sich von
Sinneseindruecken unterscheiden und die anders verarbeitet werden.
Die Sprache fuegt der Sinnesinformation eine intellektuelle
Information hinzu, und zwar hauptsaechlich in Form von Assoziationen,
die das Gegenwaertige und das Nicht-Gegenwaertige umfassen koennen.
Interessanterweise wissen wir nicht alles, was wir verstehen; und
ebenso verstehen wir nicht alles, was wir wissen.  Wir koennen zum
Beispiel wissen, dass sich in der nichteuklidischen Geometrie
Parallelen treffen.  Oder wir wissen, dass Wasser, eine Fluessigkeit,
aus Wasserstoff und Sauerstoff, also aus zwei Gasen, besteht.  Oder
auch, dass der Gebrauch von Drogen zu Abhaengigkeit fuehren kann.  Und
dennoch verstehen wir nicht unbedingt die naeheren Umstaende, Ablaeufe
und Zusammenhaenge.

In der Schriftkultur gehen wir davon aus, dass wir, wenn wir etwas
schreiben koennen, es automatisch kennen und verstehen.  Und sollte
sich zeigen, dass unser Wissen unvollstaendig, zusammenhanglos oder
nicht dauerhaft, dass es in irgendeiner Weise gestoert ist, koennen wir
es durch Lektuere vervollstaendigen oder durch Vergleich mit dem Wissen
anderer zusammenhaengender gestalten.  Die Dauerhaftigkeit und
Stabilitaet von Schrift und Schriftkultur kann sich allerdings auch
als Hemmschuh erweisen, den wir in relativ stabilen Kontexten
zunaechst nicht oder nur selten als Nachteil erfahren.  Mit
gesteigerten Effizienzerwartungen verkuerzen sich indes die Zyklen
unserer Taetigkeit.  Die groessere Intensitaet, die Variabilitaet unserer
Interaktionsstrukturen und die extrem arbeitsteilige Natur unserer
Einbindungen in die Praxis erfordern variable Bezugsrahmen fuer Wissen
und Verstehen.  In diesen veraenderten Merkmalen unserer Lebenspraxis
zeichnet sich vermehrt ein Hang zu Zweioder Mehrdeutigkeit im
Sprachgebrauch ab.  In Literatur und Theater akzeptabel und
angemessen, im politischen und diplomatischen Leben zweifelhaft,
beeinflusst ein solcher Sprachgebrauch nunmehr die schriftliche
Abfassung von Gedanken und Plaenen, die sich auf moralische Werte,
politische Progamme und wissenschaftliche oder technologische Ziele
beziehen.

Die oben erwaehnten veraenderten Umstaende unserer Lebenspraxis
erfordern auch, dass wir fuer den Erwerb und die Verbreitung von Wissen
andere als nur sprachliche Mittel und deren schriftliche
Funktionsweise einbeziehen.  Ein Wissen, das sich schnell veraendert,
kann besser mit Mitteln erworben werden, die dieser Dynamik
entsprechen.  Auch diese Mittel--interaktive Multimedien, Programme
zur virtuellen Realitaet oder genetische
Computermodellierung--veraendern sich; damit aber impliziert die
Erfahrung des Wissenserwerbs die Einsicht in den transitorischen
Charakter jener Mittel, die das Wissen speichern und darbieten.  Es
gibt heute viele Taetigkeiten, deren Wissensgrundlage nicht mehr die
traditionellen Mittel einschliesslich der schriftkulturellen
Vermittlung und Bildung sind.  Moderne Gehirnchirurgie auf neuronaler
Ebene, Entwicklung immenser weltweiter Netzwerke als Grundlage fuer
e-mail, Weltraumforschung und memetic engineering, hochspezialisierte
Kanaele des Verstehens und eine Unmenge weiterer hocheffizienter
Taetigkeiten auf einer bis vor kurzem noch nicht verfuegbaren
Wissensgrundlage kennzeichnen den Handlungsrahmen eines
Entwicklungsstadiums jenseits der Schriftkultur.


Eindeutig, zweideutig, mehrdeutig

Es gibt mindestens 700 kuenstliche Sprachen.  Hinter jeder von ihnen
steht eine praktische Erfahrung, deren Anforderungen die natuerliche
Sprache nicht ausreichend genuegen konnte.  Eine dieser Sprachen setzt
sich mit den Vorurteilen bezueglich Links- und Rechtshaendigkeit
auseinander, eine andere versucht, die geschlechtsspezifischen
Vorurteile umzukehren, wieder eine andere ist nach aesthetischen
Prinzipien konstruiert.  Es gibt literarische Kunstsprachen: Tolkiens
Elfisch, die Sprache der Klingons in Star Trek oder das Nadsat in
Burgess’ Uhrwerk Orange.  Oder es gibt wissenschaftlich begruendete
Ansaetze: logische Sprachen, an wissenschaftlichen Klassifikationen
orientierte Sprachen.  Auch die in der Vergangenheit entwickelten
kuenstlichen Sprachen orientierten sich offenkundig an pragmatischen
Funktionen: die von Ramon Llul fuer Missionare entwickelte Ars Magna
oder Hildegard von Bingens aus dem kloesterlichen Leben erwachsene,
aber weit ueber rein liturgische Funktionen hinausgehende Lingua
Ignota.

Sie alle versuchen auf ihre Art, die Leistung der Sprachfunktionen zu
verbessern.  Einige verfolgen das Ziel, die Grenzen zwischen den
Sprachen zu ueberwinden; andere sollen eine bessere Beschreibung und
damit eine bessere Beherrschung der Welt ermoeglichen.  Ihnen allen
liegt die Erkenntnis zugrunde, dass die Sprache nicht ein neutrales
Ausdrucks-, Kommunikations- und Bedeutungsmittel, sondern mit allen
Eigenschaften unserer Lebenspraxis einschliesslich ihrer Vorurteile
aufgeladen ist.  Deshalb beanspruchen sie, allgemein oder in
speziellen Bereichen ein besseres Bild von der Welt zu bieten.
Ungeachtet ihrer Ziele und ihres Erfolgs erlauben uns diese Sprachen,
die kognitiven Bedingungen und ihren Beitrag zur Effizienzsteigerung
in unserer Lebenspraxis genauer zu untersuchen.

Die erhoehte expressive Kraft in den erwaehnten literarischen
Kunstsprachen ist dabei noch relativ leicht nachzuvollziehen.  Sie
gelten als literarische Konventionen, sind Teil der aesthetischen
Erfahrung und Bestandteil der Schriftkultur.  Sie erstreben keine
Praezision, sondern Ausdrucksdichte und sind auf eine sublime Art
mehrdeutig.  Praezision wird man eher in logischen Sprachen oder in
den Programmiersprachen fuer Computer finden.  Programmiersprachen wie
Cobol, Fortran, C, C++, Lisp oder Java werden auf Wegen verbreitet,
die sich den Anspruechen von Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur
widersetzen; sie erfuellen hoechste Effizienzerwartungen und sind wegen
ihrer Funktionalitaet anerkannt.  Sie eignen sich zum Abfassen von
Gedichten ebensowenig, wie sich die literarischen Kunstsprachen fuer
das Betreiben eines Computers eignen.  Sie zeichnen sich aus durch
ihre konsequente Eindeutigkeit.  In solchen Sprachen koennen wir die
Funktion und die Logik kontrollieren.  Sie sind modulartig konzipiert
und auf die optimale Erfuellung ihrer Aufgaben angelegt.  Zu ihren
Funktionen gehoeren Beweisbarkeit, Optimierung und Praezision.  Zu den
verwendbaren logischen Formen gehoeren u. a. die klassische
propositionale Logik, die intuitionistische propositionale Logik, die
modale Logik und die temporale Logik.

Daneben zeichnet sich noch eine Kategorie von sogenannten
kontrollierten Sprachen ab.  Eine kontrollierte Sprache ist die
Teilmenge einer natuerlichen Sprache (begrenzt in Vokabular, Grammatik
und Stil), die auf eine bestimmte Taetigkeit hin entworfen ist.  Alle
erwaehnten kuenstlichen Sprachen orientieren sich an der Funktionsweise
der sogenannten natuerlichen Sprache mit dem Ziel, die Leistung der
Sprachmaschine in irgendeiner Weise zu optimieren.  Um diesen Ansatz
noch besser zu verstehen, muessen wir genauer darlegen, wie die
Sprache die in ihr konstituierten Menschen zur Welt, in der sie leben,
in Beziehung bringt.  Wir wollen beginnen mit der Entwicklung des
Wortes und seiner Beziehung zum Ausdruecken von Gedanken, d. h. mit
der Entwicklung vom Eindeutigen (Einszu-Eins-Entsprechung) zum
Mehrdeutigen (Eins-zu-Viele-Relation).

Systeme aus eindeutigen Zeichen haben an der Hervorbringung von
Gedanken nur geringen Anteil.  Als Weiterentwicklung von Signalen
sind urspruengliche Zeichen eindeutig.  Federn stammen definitiv nicht
von Fischen oder Saeugetieren, Blutflecken ruehren von Wunden her,
Vierfuesser hinterlassen andere Spuren als Zweifuesser.  Polysemie
(Mehrdeutigkeit eines Zeichens) hat sich erst allmaehlich entwickelt
und zeugt von der Rueckwirkung der Bedeutung auf den Bedeutungstraeger:
Woerter, Zeichnungen, Geraeusche usw.  Eine Tierzeichnung verweist auf
das dargestellte Tier oder auf daran geknuepfte Assoziationen:
Fellqualitaet, Gefahr, Fleisch.

Philosophie und Literatur (und die Kuenste allgemein) wurden erst auf
einer bestimmten Ebene der Sprachentwicklung als Ausdruck einer hoeher
entwickelten Lebenspraxis moeglich.  Der Philosoph greift zum Beispiel
auf die gewoehnliche Sprache (Verbalsprache) zurueck, verwendet sie
aber auf ungewoehnliche Weise: metasemisch, metaphorisch, metaphysisch.
Die antike Philosophie, die wir als Zeugnis fuer Sprache und
Schriftkultur heranziehen, ist noch so metaphorisch, dass man sie als
Literatur lesen kann und tatsaechlich auch als solche aufgenommen
wurde.  Die moderne Philosophie (nach Heidegger) hat aufgezeigt, wie
die Beziehungen (die sie hervorhebt und behandelt) die
Bezugsgegenstaende in sich aufgenommen haben.  Als formalisierte
Argumentation, frei von den Beschraenkungen der Schriftkultur und
freilich auch weniger expressiv als die im Wort ausformulierte
Philosophie und ihre endlosen Interpretationen, hat Philosophie
nunmehr ihre eigene Veranlassung und Rechtfertigung entwickelt.  Die
praktischen Auswirkungen im Rahmen einer Lebenspraxis, die auf
anderen als schriftkulturellen semiotischen Funktionsweisen beruht,
werden indes zunehmend geringer.

Die Distanz zwischen der Wortform und der Bedeutsamkeit eines
Gedankens wird als solche zum Parameter fuer die Weiterentwicklung vom
Natur- zum Kulturzustand.  Woerter wie Raum, Zeit, Materie, Bewegung
wurden erst moeglich durch die Schrifterfahrung.  Sobald man sie aber
niedergeschrieben hatte, war nichts mehr uebrig von der unmittelbaren,
vermutlich intuitiven Erfahrung von Raum und Zeit, von Materie in
ihren verschiedenen Erscheinungsformen oder von Bewegung.  Visuelle
Darstellungen--andere Formen des Schreibens also--sind dem von ihnen
Dargestellten naeher: die cartesianischen Koordinaten als Darstellung
des Raumes, die Uhr als zyklische Zeitauffassung und aehnliches.  Sie
bringen spezifische Beziehungen in Raum und Zeit oder spezifische
Aspekte von Materie oder Bewegung zum Ausdruck.

Das Wort ist im Vergleich zum darin ausgedrueckten Gedanken
willkuerlich.  Der Gedanke, geboren aus dem Tun des Menschen, ist in
der Naturordnung oder im Denken praktisch offenbartes Wissen.  Im
Ausdruck des Gedankens treffen rationale Strenge und Expressivitaet
aufeinander.  Dieses synthetisierende Herausbilden von Gedanken ist
ein wichtiger Fall menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung.  Gedanken
druecken auch den impliziten Wunsch des Menschen aus, sie zu
veraeusserlichen (Marcuse sprach von der "imperativen Qualitaet" des
Denkens).  In schriftlicher Fassung legen die Woerter indes nicht nur
die Fluechtigkeit der Sprachlaute ab, sie werden gleichzeitig offen
fuer potentiell konfligierende Interpretationen.  Diese ergeben sich
daraus, dass wir Woerter in unterschiedlichen pragmatischen Situationen
unterschiedlich verwenden.

In der Schriftkultur gebildet zu sein heisst, die Sprache zu
beherrschen, heisst aber auch, in den Erfahrungen der Vergangenheit
verhaftet und ihren Regeln unterworfen zu bleiben.  Jeder Gedanke ist
das Resultat einer Entscheidung zwischen mehreren Moeglichkeiten in
einem gegebenen Existenzparadigma.  Er findet seine genaue Bestimmung,
d. h. seinen Niederschlag als Bedeutung, dadurch, dass er einem
pragmatischen Kontext zugeordnet wird.  Veraendert sich der Kontext,
kann der Gedanke bestaetigt werden, auf Widerspruch treffen (er wird
zweideutig) oder sich vielen Interpretationen oeffnen (er wird
mehrdeutig).  Ein Beispiel: Der Begriff der Demokratie durchlief alle
Stadien von seinen ersten Erwaehnungen in der griechischen Kultur bis
zur liberalen Ausdeutung--und Selbstverleugnung--im Stadium jenseits
der Schriftkultur.  Er bedeutet eines--die Macht des Volkes--, ist
aber kontextabhaengig, je nachdem, was man unter Volk verstand und wie
man Macht ausuebte.  In seinen neuen Kontexten bedeutet er so viel
Verschiedenes, dass sich manche fragen, ob er ueberhaupt noch etwas
bedeutet.

Schriftkultur bot den geeigneten Rahmen und die angemessenen Mittel
zur Kommunikation von Ideen.  Wenn aber Ideen in immer schnellerem
Rhythmus zum Ausdruck kommen und in immer kuerzeren Zyklen von
Eindeutigkeit zu Mehrdeutigkeit uebergehen, dann wird Schriftkultur
und Schriftlichkeit entweder nicht mehr deren praktischer Funktion
oder der Dynamik individueller Selbstsetzung gerecht.  Es sieht sogar
so aus, als wuerden Ideen als solche, in ihrer Leistung als Mittel
menschlicher Projektion, immer weniger wichtig.  Was wir einstmals
als den Hoehepunkt menschlicher Leistungsfaehigkeit angesehen haben,
betrifft die heutige Gesellschaft immer weniger.  Unsere Welt ist
beherscht von Methoden und Produkten, und Ideen haben allenfalls
kulturelle Bedeutung.  Wissen ist heute auf Information reduziert;
Verstehen ist lediglich operational.  Immer mehr kuenstliche Sprachen
werden entwickelt und zunehmend auf Methoden und Produkte
ausgerichtet.  In der vernetzten Welt der digitalen
Informationsverbreitung brauchen wir kein Esperanto, sondern Sprachen,
die die grenzenlose Vielfalt der Geraete und Programme vereinen, mit
denen wir unsere neuen Erfahrungen im World Wide Web machen.  Auch
Effizienz bezieht sich in dieser Welt auf Transaktionen, in die nicht
mehr unbedingt Menschen als handelnde Personen eingebunden sind.
Innerhalb dessen, was sich als Netconomy etabliert, betreiben
unabhaengige Agenten, d. h. autonome Programme, die geschaeftlichen
Transaktionen und maximieren den Profit (weil es jeder wuenscht).
Diese Agenten sind mit Regeln fuer Reproduktion, Bewegung und Fairness
versehen und koennen auch kulturell identifiziert werden.  Netconomy
ist bislang allerdings mehr Verheissung als Wirklichkeit.  Das
Funktionieren solcher Agenten zeigt uns allerdings, wie die Metapher
vom Funktionieren der Sprache in unserer Welt jenseits der
Schriftkultur zu ihrer woertlichen Bedeutung zurueckfindet.  Die
Visualisierung von Gedanken Das mindeste, wofuer das geschriebene
Zeichen--Wort, Satz oder Text--steht, ist das Sprachzeichen.
Allerdings musste die Schrift eine laengere Entwicklungsphase
durchlaufen, bevor sie diesen Stand erreicht hatte.  In ihren
vorsprachlichen Formen hatte die graphische Darstellung ihren
Bezugsgegenstand in der Wirklichkeit--sie re-praesentierte das, was
nicht praesent war.  Das Praesente braucht nicht repraesentiert zu
werden.  Die Richtung, die der visuellen Repraesentation eingepraegt
ist, weist von der Vergangenheit zur Gegenwart.  Das, was aufgehoben
werden muss, liegt dem Akt der Entfremdung von der Unmittelbarkeit als
urspruengliche Motivation zugrunde.  Die fruehen Formen der
Repraesentation, insgesamt Teil eines recht primitiven Repertoires,
besitzen nur Ausdrucksfunktion.  Sie bewahren vom Nicht-Praesenten
(was nicht gesehen, gehoert, gefuehlt, gerochen werden kann) die
relevante Information fuer die zukuenftigen Beziehungen zwischen
Menschen und deren Umwelt auf.  Das Bild gehoert zur Natur.
Mitgeteilt wird die Art des Sehens oder Erkennens, nicht das
tatsaechlich Gesehene.  Der Vollzug des geschriebenen Zeichens
hingegen ist nicht Informationsvergabe, die dann zur Verfertigung von
Gegenstaenden fuehren kann, sondern das, was es bedeutet.  Eine relativ
geringe Zahl von Zeichen--das Alphabet, Zeichensetzung und
diakritische Zeichen--ist an der immanenten Unbegrenztheit der
Kompetenz des Schreibens beteiligt.

Wie immer wir menschliches Denken definieren, seine Festlegung hat es
erst in der Schrift gefunden.  Die in der Schrift festgehaltene
Gegenwart verliert ihren Charakter als unmittelbarer Vorgang.  Kein
geschriebenes Wort ist je zum Vorschein gekommen, das nicht auch
geaeussert und gehoert, d. h. empfunden worden ist.  Die Bedeutung
(intendierte und zugewiesene) ergibt sich aus der Einrichtung der
Sprache in der Lebenspraxis.  Nicht zufaellig haben sich die raeumliche
Einrichtung des Menschen (in doerflichen Siedlungsformen) und die
Einrichtung der Sprache als Schrift (ihrer Natur nach ebenfalls
raeumlich) gleichzeitig vollzogen (vgl.  Leroi-Gourhan).  Eine dritte
Komponente gehoert allerdings auch in diesen Zusammenhang, naemlich die
Sprache von Zeichnungen, die, so primitiv sie auch gewesen sein moegen,
bei der Anfertigung von Schutz- und Arbeitsvorrichtungen dienlich
waren.

Dieser allgemeine Kontext fuehrte schliesslich hin zum grossen
historischen Moment der griechischen Philosophie, die wir im
zeitlichen Zusammenhang sehen muessen mit der Alphabetisierung und im
allgemeineren kulturellen Zusammenhang mit der Entwicklung mancherlei
handwerklicher Kuenste, allen voran die Architektur.  Sokrates, der
das Denken und die Wahrheit im Gespraech suchte, verfocht die
Muendlichkeit.  Das ist zumindest das Bild, das uns Platon von ihm
vermittelt.  Die grossen Handwerker seiner Zeit teilten diese
Einstellung.  Zum Bau von Tempeln und der Herstellung von Werkzeugen
und anderen nuetzlichen Geraeten war nicht unbedingt Schrift vonnoeten.
Die heuristischen und maeeutischen Methoden, mit deren Hilfe der
Mensch seine Handlungsalternativen und neuen Optionen ueberprueft und
ueberdenkt, sind im wesentlichen muendlich.  Sie setzen die physische
Praesenz des Philosophen oder des Architekten voraus.  Eigentlich hat
sich bis heute nicht viel daran geaendert, wenn wir uns vor Augen
halten, wie Design oder Ingenieurwissenschaften auch heute noch
unterrichtet werden.  Aber das aendert sich: gerade diese Bereiche
beziehen immer mehr die digitale Verarbeitung mit ein.
Computationale praktische Erfahrungen, die diese digitale
Datenverarbeitung einbeziehen, genetic engineering, d. h. die
Gestaltung und Erzeugung neuer genetischer Produkte, oder Memetik
sind nicht mehr nur Fortentwicklungen jener Erfahrungen, die auf
Schriftkultur gruenden, sondern ganz anderer Natur.


Buchstabenkulturen und Aphasie

In der Kulturgeschichte hat es wiederholt kritische
Auseinandersetzungen mit der Schriftkultur und Schriftbildung gegeben,
deren bekannteste nach Platon wohl die von Marshall McLuhan ist.
Buchstabenkulturen, so seine Position in Gutenberg’s Galaxy (1964),
haben die Welt uniformisiert, fragmentarisiert und auf logische
Abfolgen hin ausgerichtet, was ueberzogenen Rationalismus,
Nationalismus und Individualismus gezuechtet habe.  Vernunft sei mit
Schriftkultur und Rationalismus mit einer einzigen Technologie
gleichgesetzt worden.  Solche Attacken haben nun allerdings--soweit
wir das aus unserer heutigen Sicht beurteilen koennen--nicht dazu
gefuehrt, dass die Schriftlichkeit und ihr Einfluss abgenommen haben.
Aus anderer Perspektive hat im uebrigen Roland Barthes (1970) die
Notwendigkeit einer muendlich-visuellen Kultur hervorgehoben.

Ohne Frage gehoeren alle Plaene, die je von Architekten, Handwerkern
oder Designern entworfen worden sind, einer Praxis an, die muendliche
(Anweisungen zur Umsetzung des Plans in ein Produkt) und visuelle
Kulturformen verbindet.  Viele solcher Plaene mit Gedanken und
Konzepten, die vielleicht genauso kuehn sind wie die, die in
Manuskripten und spaeter in Buechern aufgezeichnet wurden, sind
verloren gegangen.  Einige Werke haben die Zeiten ueberdauert.  Die
Tatsache, dass die Dominanz des geschriebenen Wortes die immense
Bedeutung von Zeichnungen in den Hintergrund unserer Wahrnehmung
verdraengt hat, kann jedoch nicht darueber hinwegtaeuschen, dass durch
sie unsere Erfahrung nachhaltig gepraegt und wichtiges Wissen
uebermittelt wurde.  Zeichnungen sind holistische Einheiten, deren
Komplexitaet nur schwer mit der eines Textes verglichen werden kann.

Die Bedeutung, die durch die Schrift vermittelt wird, vollzieht sich
in einem Prozess der Verallgemeinerung und Reindividualisierung.  Was
bedeutet es fuer ein Individuum, sie zu lesen und zu verstehen?  Es
durchlaeuft den Weg, der vom Sprechen zum Schreiben, vom Konkreten zum
Abstrakten und von der analytischen zur synthetischen Funktion der
Sprache fuehrte, in umgekehrter Richtung.  Zu jedem beliebigen
Zeitpunkt verfuegen wir einerseits ueber die begrenzte Wirklichkeit der
Zeichen (Alphabet, Woerter, Idiome), und andererseits die praktisch
unbegrenzte Wirklichkeit, die in den zum Ausdruck gebrachten
Sprachsequenzen und Begriffen verkoerpert ist.  Daraus ergibt sich die
Frage nach dem Ursprung der Gedanken, bzw. der Begriffe und dem
Verhaeltnis zwischen Zeichen (vor allem Woertern) und der ihnen
zugewiesenen Bedeutung, bzw. dem Inhalt, der durch Sprache
weitervermittelt werden kann.  In westlichen Kulturen wird Bedeutung
durch additive Mechanismen hervorgerufen, vergleichbar mit dem
Anmischen von Pigmenten.  In oestlichen Kulturen beruht Bedeutung auf
substraktiven Mechanismen, vergleichbar mit der Mischung von Licht.

Obwohl Buchstabenschrift einfacher und stabiler als ideographische
Schrift erscheint, ist sie doch schwieriger.  Das liegt am hoeheren
Abstraktionsgrad.  Daher muss der Leser eines Buchstabentextes die
grosse Kluft zwischen dem graphischen Zeichen und dem Bezeichneten mit
seiner eigenen Erfahrung ueberbruecken.  Die praktische
schriftkulturelle Erfahrung geht von der Annahme aus, dass die Bildung
in Form von geschichtlichem und kulturellem Bewusstsein diesen
Referenzbezug ersetzt.  Die Leser von ideographischen Texten haben
den Vorteil einer groesseren Konkretheit der Darstellung.  Da also jede
Sprache ihre eigene Geschichte in sich traegt, gewissermassen als
Zusammenfassung der sie hervorbringenden Lebenspraxis, impliziert das
Lesen in einer anderen Sprache zugleich die Konfrontation mit einer
fremden Erfahrung und damit die Notwendigkeit, diese Schrift Schritt
fuer Schritt fuer sich neu zu erfinden.

Die Aphasieforschung der letzten 15 Jahre hat gezeigt, dass ab einem
bestimmten Stadium eine Regression von der Schrift- zur Bildlektuere
(piktographisches, ikonisches Lesen) zu verzeichnen ist.  Buchstaben
verlieren ihre sprachliche Identitaet.  Der aphasische Leser sieht nur
Linien, Unterbrechungen, Formen.  Begriffe und Gedanken brechen im
wahrsten Sinn des Wortes zusammen.  Erkennbar bleibt einzig die
AEhnlichkeit zwischen konkreten Formen.  Der Niedergang vom Abstrakten
zum Konkreten kann als soziokultureller Unfall vor dem Hintergrund
eines natuerlichen (biologischen) Unfalls gedeutet werden.

Heutzutage verzeichnen wir aehnliche Symptome, die auf eine Art
kollektiver Aphasie in gegenteiliger Richtung hindeuten.  Schrift
wird dekonstruiert und zur Graffiti-Notation, zu kurzschriftartigen,
von Sprache und Schriftkultur befreiten Statements.  Eine Zeitlang
waren Graffiti kriminalisiert.  Spaeter wurden sie zur Kunstgattung
erhoben und vom Markt absorbiert.  Dabei sind wir uns vermutlich nie
des Ausmasses bewusst geworden, in dem gerade auch Graffiti durch eine
Form von Alphabetismus gekennzeichnet ist, haben wir uns kaum
Klarheit verschafft ueber deren Urspruenge, ihre Verbreitung und die
"aphasischen" Implikationen ihrer Ausuebung.  Nicht nur die New Yorker
U-Bahn wurde in eine bewegliche Zeitung verwandelt, die so oft
erschien, wie man die Aufsicht taeuschen konnte.  Ein grosser Teil der
OEffentlichkeit lehnte Graffiti ab, denn es widersetzte sich der
legitimierten Kommunikation und zugleich der Aura von Ordnung und
Korrektheit, die der Schriftkultur zugrunde liegt.  Viele andere
fanden ihre Freude daran.  Die Rap-Musik ist das musikalische
Gegenstueck zum Graffiti.  Die Botschaften, die heute auf den
Datenautobahnen ausgetauscht werden, weisen oft Merkmale der Aphasie
auf.  Konkretheit steht an erster Stelle. :-) (der smiley im
Internet) z. B. eruebrigt jeden anderen Ausdruck von Freude.  Fuer den
stupenden Informationsaustausch in den digitalen Netzwerken ist
solche kollektive Aphasie symptomatisch fuer Veraenderungen der
kognitiven Voraussetzungen derer, die in diese Erfahrungen
eingebunden sind.  Weder opportunistische Begeisterung noch
dogmatische Ablehnung koennen uns helfen, die Notwendigkeit dieser
Entwicklung und ihre Nutzanwendung zu verstehen.  Viele private
Sprachen und unzaehlige Kodes zirkulieren als Kilo- und Megabytes
zwischen den Kommunikationspartnern und entziehen sich jeglicher
Regulierung.

Die digitalen Netzwerke haben sich als ein Handlungsrahmen erwiesen,
der die heutigen Erwartungen angemessen erfuellt; die traditionelle
Form der Schriftkultur sieht sich dabei herausgefordert durch
fluechtigere, auf Teilbereiche beschraenkte Sondersprachen.  Der
Allgemeinheitsanspruch der Schriftkultur ist unhaltbar, wenngleich
sie als ein Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsmittel bestehen bleibt.
Aber manch einer hat erfahren, dass sie fuer den praktischen und
geistigen Erfahrungshorizont einer Menschheit, die aus allen ihren
alten Kleidern, Spielzeugen, Buechern, Geschichten, Werkzeugen und
sogar Konflikten herausgewachsen ist, nicht mehr ausreicht.

Es draengt sich als Anschlussfrage auf, ob die schriftkulturelle
Erfahrung des Wortes zu dessen stetig abnehmender Bestimmtheit
beigetragen hat oder ob die Kontextveraenderungen dessen
Interpretation, will sagen: die semantische Verschiebung von bestimmt
zu vage, verursacht.  Vermutlich spielen beide Faktoren dabei eine
Rolle.  Einerseits erschoepft die Schriftkultur ihre eigenen
Moeglichkeiten.  Andererseits beschraenken neue Kontexte ihre
Leistungsfaehigkeit als das beherrschende Medium fuer den Ausdruck, die
Kommunikation und die Bezeichnung von Gedanken.

Wir alle kennen Versuche, Sprache so kontextfrei wie moeglich zu
verwenden--die Verallgemeinerungen jeglicher Demagogie (liberaler,
konservativer, linker oder rechter, religioeser oder emanzipierter)
koennen als Beispiel dienen; aber auch die vielen Formen des Lesens
der Zukunft aus Glaskugeln, Handflaechen, Tarotkarten, die in den
vergangenen Jahren vor dem Hintergrund zunehmender Illiteralitaet
entstanden sind.  Nichts davon ist neu; neu ist nur, dass dieser Markt
voller Unbestimmtheit und Ambiguitaet, der abweichende Funktionsweisen
der Sprache erkennen laesst, in voller Bluete steht.  Dies alles sind
Symptome fuer eine Veraenderung unserer Lebenspraxis, wie sie im
vorliegenden Buch dargelegt ist.

Wir muessen allerdings die Veraenderungen der Sprachfunktionen noch
genauer erlaeutern.  Wir wissen heute, dass die aeltesten ueberlieferten
Hoehlenzeichnungen indexikalische Hinweiszeichen aus einem muendlichen
Kontext, und weniger Darstellungen von Jagdszenen sind (wenn sie auch
oft so interpretiert werden).  Sie zeugen mehr von denen, die sie
gezeichnet haben, als von dem, was gezeichnet ist.  Die ueberholte
Schriftlichkeit mystifizierter Botschaften fungiert auf aehnliche
Weise.  Sie sagt mehr aus ueber ihre Verfasser als ueber ihren
Gegenstand, ob dieser nun Geschichte, Soziologie oder Anthropologie
ist.  Die gestiegene muendliche und visuelle, technologisch optimierte
Kommunikation nun definiert die jenseits der Schriftkultur liegende
neue kognitive Dimension des Menschen.  Der UEbergang vom Sprechen zum
Schreiben entspricht dem UEbergang von einer pragmatisch-affektiven
Lebenspraxis zu einer pragmatisch-rationalen Ebene mit linearen
Beziehungen zwischen den Menschen und ihrer Umwelt.  Sie vollzieht
sich im Zusammenhang der Evolution vom Synkretistischen zum
Analytischen.  Der neuerliche UEbergang von Schriftkultur zu einer
Vielzahl von Alphabetismen wiederum entspricht einer Lebenspraxis,
die sich durch nicht-lineare Beziehungen auszeichnet und die einer
fortschreitenden Entwicklung vom Analytischen zum Synkretistischen
entspringt.  Diese Bemerkungen beziehen sich auf die europaeischen
Kulturen und ihre Ableger.  Die ostasiatischen Sprachen weisen eine
Tendenz zum Aufzeigen statt zum Erklaeren auf.  Die analytische
Struktur des logischen Denkens (die wir spaeter eingehender eroertern)
wird in der Satzstruktur der Sprache gebildet, die in diesen beiden
Kulturbereichen grundlegend anders ist.  Die imperative Energie des
Ausdrucksvorgangs verleiht z. B. der chinesischen Sprache einen
permanenten Hervorbringungscharakter (Sprechen im Vollzug, im
Entstehen).  Die hervorgehobene Rolle dieses Vorgangs in der
asiatischen Kultur spiegelt sich in der zentralen Position des Verbs.
Die Anordnung der Satzteile um das Verb herum lenkt das Denken auf
die Beziehung zwischen Bedingung und Bedingtem.

Die fuer den europaeischen Kulturkreis charakteristische Form der Logik
(unter dem deutlichen Einfluss der klassischen griechischen
Philosophie) spiegelt sich in der hervorgehobenen Position des
Substantivs.  Es ist freier und stabiler als das Verb und kann
Identitaet, Invarianz und das Allgemeine wiedergeben.  Die auf dieser
Voraussetzung gruendende Logik sucht die Einheit zwischen Spezies und
Genus.  Die Schrift der europaeischen Kulturen und die ideographische
Schrift des Orients haben beide auf ihre Weise Logik, Rhetorik,
Heuristik und Dialektik zu definieren versucht.  Aus historischer
Sicht sind sie komplementaer.  Mit Blick auf die Geschichte des Wissen
und auf die Geschichte als solche koennte man sagen, dass das
europaeische Abendland Wissen und Weltkontrolle, der Orient
Selbsterkenntnis und Selbstkontrolle erlangt haben.  Es waere utopisch
(und mit vielfaeltigen historischen, sozialen, ideologischen und
politischen Implikationen verbunden), sich eine Welt vorzustellen,
die beides harmonisch vereinigt.  Voraussetzung hierfuer waere im
uebrigen, dass sich der jeweilige Status der Schriftkultur in beiden
Kulturkreisen veraenderte.  Eben solche Veraenderungen in Richtung auf
eine Konvergenz der Sprachen in den erwaehnten Kulturkreisen koennen
wir indes derzeit beobachten.

Schriftlichkeit ist nicht nur ein Instrument der Vermittlung zwischen
Kulturen, sie zieht auch Grenzen.  Das gilt fuer westliche und
fernoestliche Kulturen (und alle anderen) gleichermassen.  So haelt
Japan zum Beispiel trotz der spektakulaeren Leistungen bei der
Aneignung und Fortentwicklung neuer Technologien innerhalb seiner
Grenzen an einem Rahmen fest, der seiner traditionellen Schriftkultur
und Bildung entspricht.  Ausserhalb seiner Grenzen kann es sich auf
andere Schriftkulturen und Bildungsformen hervorragend einstellen.
Auf andere Weise trifft dies auch auf China zu.  Innerhalb seiner
Grenzen baut es ein internes Netzwerk auf (Intranet), ohne dies
jedoch an das allumfassende Netz (Internet) ganz anzubinden, das uns
in einigen Bereichen die Erfahrung der Globalitaet eroeffnet.

Die hierarchische Organisation, mit der man sich im Westen den
ehemaligen wirtschaftlichen Erfolg Japans zu erklaeren versuchte, ist
letztlich auf die Einheit semmai-kohai, d. h. senior-junior,
zurueckzufuehren.  Diese Unterscheidung entspricht einer spezifischen
Logik und Ethik, die vom Vorrang des Alten ueber das Junge ausgehen
und die pragmatischer Natur sind.  Anerkannt werden damit Erfahrung
und Leistung, die im Japanischen in den Kategorien kyu, d. i.
Tuechtigkeit und Geuebtheit, und dau, etwa Erfahrung, ausgedrueckt
werden.  Diese Systematik wirkt sich auf das Wirtschaftsleben, auf
Kalligraphie, japanischen Ringkampf (sumo), Blumenschmuck (ikebana)
und die gesellschaftliche Ordnung aus.  Auch dieses System ist von
der Dynamik der gegenwaertigen Veraenderungen nicht unberuehrt geblieben.

Mit Blick auf die Leistungen der Sprache muessen wir feststellen, dass
Nationalsprachen zur Abkapselung fuehren, angenommene Sprachen
hingegen--hier besonders Englisch--als Bindeglied zur uebrigen Welt
dienen koennen.  Auch die japanische Gesellschaft sieht sich einer
zunehmend global organisierten Welt gegenueber und damit der
Notwendigkeit ausgesetzt, neue, dieser globalen Welt angemessene
Ausdrucks-, Kommunikations- und Bedeutungsmittel zu entwickeln.
Einerseits zeigt sich Japan als eine an den Vorurteilen der
Schriftkultur und traditionellen Bildung ausgerichtete Gesellschaft,
streng hierarchisch organisiert, frauen- und fremdenfeindlich,
dogmatisch; andererseits, trotz der gegenwaertigen Krise in Japan,
beweist es eine erstaunliche Faehigkeit, sich auf die veraenderten
Bedingungen der Lebenspraxis und der Selbstsetzung als Japaner und
zugleich als integrierte Mitglieder der Weltgemeinschaft einzurichten.
Folglich entwickeln sich auch in dieser so homogenen Kultur neue
Formen der Schriftlichkeit und Bildung, die wir im uebrigen auch in
China, Korea, Indonesien und den arabischen Laendern feststellen
koennen.  Und dieser Prozess weitet sich allmaehlich, wenn auch
langsamer als von einigen erwartet, auf die afrikanischen und
suedamerikanischen Laender aus.

Die globale Wirtschaft erfordert neue Beziehungsformen zwischen den
Staaten und Kulturen, und diese Beziehungsformen muessen der Dynamik
der neuen Lebenspraxis angemessen sein.  Die zwanghafte Suche nach
Identitaet, die sich in den multikulturellen Tendenzen unserer Tage
ausdrueckt, wird in der Vergangenheit keine hinreichenden Argumente
finden.  Den besten Beleg hierfuer liefern die Aktivisten dieser
Bewegung mit ihren Fehldarstellungen von historischen Ereignissen,
Fakten und Zahlen.  Multikulturalitaet entspricht der Dynamik, die
sich jenseits der Schriftkultur entwickelt: sie verlagert den Akzent
von der Einmaligkeit und Universalitaet einer einzig vorherrschenden
Kultur und Kulturform auf eine Pluralitaet, die keine ethnische Gruppe,
keinen Lebensstil, keine Kultur ausgrenzt.  Wer Multikulturalitaet
heute als eine Frage der Rasse oder Feminismus als eine Frage des
Geschlechts (vor dem Hintergrund der Geschichte) behandelt, wird
keine wirksame Strategie fuer diejenigen entwickeln koennen, deren
Andersartigkeit heute anerkannt ist.  Andersartigkeit bringt andere
Faehigkeiten mit sich und andere Wege, die jeweilige Identitaet zur
Geltung zu bringen.  Die Vergangenheit ist unbedeutend geworden; die
Zukunft hat uns zu beschaeftigen.



Kapitel 5:


Sprache und Logik

Etwa zu der Zeit, in der Computer zum alltaeglichen Bestandteil
unseres Lebens wurden, entwarf ein relativ unbekannter
Science-Fiction-Autor eine utopische Welt, die er non A (A) nennt.
Sie ist auf unserem Planeten im Jahr 2560 angesiedelt, und non A
bezeichnet eine Form der nicht-aristotelischen Logik, die in ein
Computerspiel eingebettet ist, das die Welt beherrscht.  Gilbert
Gosseyn (im Englischen Go Sane ausgesprochen, was im Deutschen soviel
wie "werde gesund", "werde vernuenftig" heisst), der Protagonist dieser
Welt, entdeckt ploetzlich, dass er mehr ist als nur eine Person.

Jeder, der ein wenig mit der Geschichte der Logik vertraut ist, wird
hier an Levy-Bruhls umstrittenes Gesetz der Mitbeteiligung denken,
das von der folgenden Annahme ausgeht: "In den kollektiven
Darstellungen einer primitiven Mentalitaet koennen Gegenstaende,
Lebewesen und Phaenomene auf eine Weise, die wir nicht begreifen
koennen, gleichzeitig sie selbst und etwas anderes sein."  Die relativ
undifferenzierte, synkretistische Erfahrung, die den Anfangsstadien
Notation und Schrift zugrunde lag, kannte offenbar vielfaeltige, uns
ungewoehnlich erscheinende Verbindungen.  Bei der Erforschung der von
primitiven Staemmen hervorgebrachten Produkte hat sich gezeigt, dass
einerseits das visuelle Denken vorherrscht, und andererseits die
Funktionsweise des Menschen in einem Zusammenhang gedacht wird, den
wir heute multivalente Logik nennen wuerden.

Obwohl die Welt von non A in ferner Zukunft liegt, beschreibt sie
doch eine Logik, die wir mit einem lange zurueckliegenden Stadium der
menschlichen Entwicklung verbinden.  Aus der Anthropologie wissen wir,
dass es noch heute in den Regenwaeldern des Amazonas und in entlegenen
Eskimo-Gebieten Staemme gibt, deren Angehoerige sich nicht nur als sie
selbst begreifen, sondern zugleich als etwas anderes, als Vogel,
Pflanze oder als vergangenes Ereignis.  Hierbei handelt es sich nicht
nur um eine andere Sprachverwendung, sondern um eine andere Form der
Identitaetsbildung.  In diesem pragmatischen Zusammenhang uebersteigt
der logische Schluss die Grenzen, die ihm die aristotelische Logik mit
ihrem Dualismus von wahr und falsch setzt.  Moeglicherweise ist der
Begriff der multivalenten Logik eine gute Bezeichnung fuer diese Art
von Schlussfolgerung; er liefert indes keine Erklaerung dafuer, warum
die Selbstkonstituierung auf solche Mechanismen zurueckgreift und wie
sie funktionieren.  Selbst wenn wir eine Antwort darauf finden wuerden,
muessten wir uns doch fragen--da sich unsere Selbstsetzung nach einer
anderen Logik vollzieht--, welche Beziehung zwischen der
Spracherfahrung und dem logischen Rahmen jener Menschen besteht, die
in der non-A-Welt vergangener Zeiten lebten.  Der in solchen Staemmen
vorherrschende Umgang mit Bildern erklaert, warum es ein logisches
Kontinuum anstelle der scharfen Trennung zwischen wahr und falsch,
gegenwaertig und abwesend gibt.  Mehrwertige Logik in den
verschiedensten Auspraegungen und pragmatischen Zusammenhaengen wurde
zurueckgedraengt, als Sprache ihre schriftliche, auf einem Alphabet
basierende Form annahm und das Denken sich in schriftlichen
Ausdruecken stabilisierte.  Die Bewusstmachung von Verbindungen, die
dezidiert in die Erfahrung eingebunden sind und in einem Korpus
intelligiblen Wissens quantifiziert werden, klaeren den logischen
Horizont.  Mit der Unterdrueckung einer multivalenten Logik wurden
Einheiten nur als das konstituiert, als das sie die Erfahrung
erscheinen liess, und nicht mehr als viele Dinge gleichzeitig.

Der Wechsel von der Muendlichkeit zur praktischen Erfahrung der
geschriebenen Sprache wirkte sich auf viele Aspekte der menschlichen
Interaktion aus.  Die Schrift brachte einen Referenzrahmen mit sich,
Moeglichkeiten des Vergleichs und der Bewertung, und damit ueberhaupt
eine Vorstellung von Wert, als Ergebnis einer Wahl unter einer
begrenzten Anzahl von Optionen.  Muendlichkeit wurde von denen
kontrolliert, die sie ausuebten.  Die durch Zeichen auf einer
beschriebenen Oberflaeche stabilisierte Schrift ermoeglichte eine neue,
analytische Form des Fragens.  Im Verlauf der Zeit ergaben sich in
der geschriebenen Sprache eine Reihe von Assoziationen, einige aus
dem visuellen Aspekt der Schrift, andere aus bestimmten
Schriftmustern, Wiederholungsformen und aehnlichem.  Schrift regte zum
Vergleich von Erfahrungen der Selbstkonstituierung an, indem sie den
Vergleich verschiedener Aufzeichnungen ermoeglichte.  Die Erwartung,
dass alles Aufgezeichnete akkurat aufgezeichnet ist, ist der
Schrifterfahrung implizit.  Die skeletthafte Form der Anfaenge der
Schrift bot sichtbare Verbindungen, die innerhalb der Muendlichkeit
verblassten.

Logik ist, sehr allgemein definiert, die Disziplin der
Zusammenhaenge--"Wenn das eine, dann das andere."  Diese Denkfigur
kann auf vielfaeltige Weise ausgedrueckt werden, formale Ausdruecke
eingeschlossen.  Die in der Muendlichkeit gegebenen Zusammenhaenge
waren spontan.  Mit der Schrift gingen die Stabilisierung der
Erfahrung und ein methodisches Versprechen einher.  Die Methode
besteht in den Schlussfolgerungen, die sich aus den Verknuepfungen
ergeben.  Das besagt nichts anderes, als dass die der Muendlichkeit
innewohnende Logik eine natuerliche Logik ist, die natuerliche
Zusammenhaenge wiedergibt, welche von den sich in der Schrift
niederschlagenden Verknuepfungen unterschieden sind.  Die Schrift
liefert gewissermassen das Roentgenbild eines nur schwer fassbaren
Erfahrungsschatzes, in dessen Tiefen sich Verknuepfungen und ihre
praktischen Implikationen abzuzeichnen begannen.

Das Bewusstsein von Zeit und Raum wird relativ langsam gewonnen.
Dementsprechend drueckt es sich aus als ein allmaehlich sich
einstellendes Bewusstsein davon, wie Zeit und Raum das Ergebnis
praktischer Taetigkeiten beeinflussen.  Wie die Zeichen ist auch die
Logik in der Praxis menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung verwurzelt und
entwickelt sich sehr wahrscheinlich gemeinsam mit ihnen.  Gemeinsame
Gegenwaertigkeit, d. h.  Ko-Praesenz dessen, was unterschiedlich oder
aehnlich ist, Inkompatibilitaeten, Ausschliessungen und aehnliche Zeit-
oder Raumsituationen werden von Handlungen, Gegenstaenden und Personen
losgeloest und bilden eine wohl definierte Erfahrungsschicht.  Aus
einfacheren Konfigurationen oder Verknuepfungssequenzen ergeben sich
Mechanismen der Schlussfolgerung, die man aus Gegenstaenden, Handlungen,
Personen, Situationen usw. ableitet.  Zur Festmachung solcher
Schlussfolgerungen eignet sich die Schrift sehr viel besser als
Rituale oder muendliche Ausdruecke, womit allerdings nicht gesagt ist,
dass sie damit auch die gemeinsame Teilhabe an diesen
Schlussfolgerungen erleichtert.  Was an Breite gewonnen wird, geht an
Tiefe verloren.

Die Lebenspraxis wird damit nicht nur effektiver, sondern auch
komplexer.  An die Stelle physischer Leistungen treten zunehmend
kognitive Leistungen.  Komplexere Erkenntnis und Erfahrung ergeben
sich aus erweiterten Handlungsradien und koennen nur noch in der
skeletthaften, abstrakten Form der Verschriftlichung vermittelt
werden; damit verliert die Erfahrung die reichhaltigen individuellen
Merkmale derer, die sich in ihr identifizieren.  Aus dem
Verknuepfungsreichtum ergibt sich Handlungslogik.  Der Akzent liegt
dabei auf Zeit und Raum, bzw. auf dem, was wir rueckblickend Bezuege,
bzw.  Referenz nennen.  In dem Masse, in dem die Schrift die in der
Zeit verlaufenden Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsmittel (vor allem
Rituale) ersetzt, verliert auch die zeitliche Logik an Bedeutung.
Mit der Veraenderung des pragmatischen Horizonts knuepft die
Schriftkultur in Verbindung mit der ihr innewohnenden Logik ihr
unsichtbares Netz, ihre eigene Metrik.  Alles, was nicht in
irgendeiner Weise auf diese schriftkulturelle Selbsterzeugung des
Menschen bezogen ist, bleibt ausserhalb unserer
Verstehensmoeglichkeiten.  Die Sprache der Schriftkultur erweist sich
als eine reduktionistische Maschine, mittels derer wir der Welt aus
der Perspektive unserer eigenen Erfahrungen begegnen.  Sobald wir uns
bewusst werden, dass es andere Erfahrungen gibt oder dass sie doch
moeglich sind, versuchen wir, sie zu verstehen; wir wissen aber, dass
wir dadurch, dass wir sie in unsere eigene Spracherfahrung einbinden,
die Bedingungen ignorieren, unter denen sie gewonnen wurden.
Muendliche Erziehung beruhte auf der zusammenhaengenden Einheit von
Eltern und Kind, und Erinnerung, d. h.  Erfahrung, wurde auf
unmittelbarem Wege uebertragen.  Die Schriftkultur setzte an die
Stelle dieser zusammenhaengenden Einheit die Mittel, Diskontinuitaeten
und Unterschiede zu erkennen und festzumachen.  In irgendeiner Form
der Aufzeichnung speicherte sie alles, was sich auf die gesamte
menschliche Erfahrung bezog.  Aber mit der Aufzeichnung stellte sie
auch eine neue Form der Erfahrung mit eigenen Werten dar.

Wir haben behauptet, Schriftlichkeit sei eine reduktionistische
Maschine; sie reduziert Sprache auf einen Korpus von allgemein
akzeptierten Weisen des Redens, Aufzeichnens und Lesens, die zwei
Arten von Regeln entsprechen mussten: solchen der Zusammenhaenge
(Logik) und solchen der Grammatik.  Im Rueckblick auf diese
Entwicklung koennen wir verstehen, inwiefern die Schrift die Erfahrung
menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung durch Sprache beeinflusst hat.
Insofern teilen wir auch nicht die Meinung derer, die in der
Nachfolge des jungen Wittgenstein eine der Sprache immanente Logik
fuer gegeben halten und ihre Aufgabe darin sehen, das ans Licht zu
bringen, was die Sprachzeichen verbergen.  Sprache besitzt keine
innere Logik; jede praktische Erfahrung bezieht Logik und
kontaminiert alle menschlichen Ausdrucksmittel durch die
Schlussfolgerung aus dem, was moeglich ist, auf das, was noetig ist.


Logiken hinter der Logik

Die im Sprachgebrauch angelegte Koordinationsleistung hat sich im
Verlauf der Sprachverwendung fortentwickelt.  Unveraendert blieb
allerdings die Struktur der Koordinationsmechanismen.  Logik, wie wir
sie heute kennen, also eine Disziplin, die durch den schriftlichen
Gebrauch der Sprache legitimiert ist, beschaeftigt sich mit den
strukturalen Aspekten verschiedener Sprachen.  Wenn wir den
Koordinationsmechanismus von Schrift und Schriftkultur, der die Logik
mit einbezieht, auf diese aber nicht allein reduzierbar ist,
begreifen, koennen wir auch besser verstehen, wie und warum sich jene
Bedingungen herausgebildet haben, die zur Schriftkultur fuehrten.
Dieser Koordinationsmechanismus bestand aus Regeln fuer den korrekten
Sprachgebrauch (Grammatik), aus der Bewusstwerdung der fuer die
Lebenspraxis spezifischen Zusammenhaenge (Logik), aus
UEberredungsmitteln (Rhetorik), der Wahlmoeglichkeit zwischen
verschiedenen Optionen, Erfindungskunst (Heuristik) und der
Argumentation (Dialektik).  In ihrer Gesamtheit lassen sie erkennen,
wie komplex der Vorgang der Selbstkonstituierung ist; einzeln
betrachtet erhellen sie die fragmentierten Erfahrungsbereiche des
Sprachgebrauchs, naemlich Rationalitaet, UEberzeugung, Auswahl, Handeln
und Glauben.  Jedem (relativ) normalen Geschehensablauf liegt eine
Logik zugrunde, ebenso jeder Krise, wenn wir den Begriff der Logik so
weit fassen wollen, dass er die rationale Beschreibung und Erklaerung
der Faktoren, die zu einer Krise gefuehrt haben, mit einschliesst.  Und
dieser Logik wiederum liegen andere Formen der Logik zugrunde.  Die
Logik der Religion, die Logik der Kunst, der Moral, der Wissenschaft,
der Logik selbst, die Logik der Schriftkultur: allesamt Beispiele fuer
die vielfaeltigen Interessensgegenstaende des Menschen, anhand derer er
die jeweilige Logik dem Test der Vollstaendigkeit (bezieht sie sich
auf alles?), der Folgerichtigkeit (ist sie widerspruechlich?) und
bisweilen der Transitivitaet unterzieht.

Unabhaengig vom Gegenstand (Religion, Kunst, Ethik, eine exakte
Wissenschaft, Schriftkultur usw.) richten die Menschen die jeweilige
Logik als Netzwerk gegenseitiger Beziehungen und funktionaler
Abhaengigkeiten ein, anhand dessen man die (religioese, kuenstlerische,
ethische usw.) Wahrheit zu ergruenden sucht.  Diese Logik, die ihren
Ursprung in der anfaenglichen Bewusstheit von Zusammenhaengen hatte,
entwickelte sich zu einem formalen System, von dem manche Philosophen
und Psychologen noch immer glauben, dass es in irgendeiner Weise dem
Gehirn (oder dem Geist) zugehoerig ist und dessen korrekte
Funktionsweise garantiert.  Erfolgreiches Handeln wurde in diesem
Zusammenhang als Ergebnis der Logik interpretiert, hard-wired, d. h.
fest verdrahtet, als Bestandteil der biologischen Anlage.  Andere
Forscher begreifen Logik als Produkt unserer Erfahrung, besonders
unseres Denkens, das sich auf unsere Selbstsetzung in der natuerlichen
und der von uns geschaffenen Welt bezieht.  Als Regelwerk und
Kriterienraster bezieht sich Logik auf Sprache, aber es gibt auch
eine Logik der menschlichen Handlungen, eine Logik der Kunst, der
Moral usw., die jeweils durch Regeln beschrieben werden, mit deren
Hilfe wir Unwiderspruechlichkeit erzielen, Integritaet bewahren,
Kausalzusammenhaenge erkennen und andere wichtige kognitive
Operationen wie Hypothesenbildung und Schlussfolgerungen durchfuehren
koennen.

In diesem Zusammenhang draengt sich eine alte Frage auf: Gibt es eine
universelle Logik jenseits der Unterschiede in den Sprachen und in
den biologischen Merkmalen, jenseits aller Unterschiede zwischen den
Menschen?  Die Antwort haengt davon ab, wen man fragt.  Aus unserer
Perspektive ist sie eindeutig zu verneinen.  Wir heben ja gerade
Unterschiede hervor, eben weil sie sich auf unterschiedliche Formen
der Logik erstrecken, welche sich wiederum aus unterschiedlichen
praktischen Erfahrungen ergeben.  Aber die Antwort faellt
moeglicherweise angemessener aus, wenn wir uns vor Augen halten, dass
die Hauptsprachsysteme unserer Welt unterschiedliche logische
Mechanismen verkoerpern, die sich auf die Koordinierungsfunktion der
Sprache auswirken.

Wir muessen diese logischen Systeme kurz betrachten, weil sie auch die
Bedingungen erhellen, die die Schriftkultur notwendig gemacht hat und
unter neuen pragmatischen Bedingungen weniger notwendig, wenn nicht
gar ueberfluessig, macht.  Vor allem muessen wir fragen, ob in einer
globalen Welt vereinheitlichende Kraefte oder heterogene und
diversifizierende Kraefte, wie sie in den verschiedenen
Schriftkulturen und den daran gebundenen logischen Formen verkoerpert
sind, wirksam werden.  Aristoteles gilt gemeinhin als Begruender der
im westlichen Sprachsystem angelegten Logik.  Die griechische Schrift
bot das geeignete Medium fuer seine Logik der richtigen
Schlussfolgerung aus in Saetzen ausgedrueckten Praemissen.  Die
Schriftkultur wurde das Haus dieser Logik und verlieh ihr zugleich
eine Gueltigkeit und eine Dauerhaftigkeit, die sie noch heute
unantastbar macht.  In den oestlichen Sprachsystemen finden sich
aehnlich bedeutende Beitraege in den philosophischen Hauptschriften des
alten China und des alten Japan sowie in Hindu-Texten.  Anstelle
eines zwangslaeufig oberflaechlichen UEberblicks moechte ich ein Zitat
des Fung Yu Lan zum Wesen der chinesischen Philosophie (das zugleich
repraesentativ fuer den gesamten Fernen Osten ist) heranziehen:
"Philosophie darf nicht nur Gegenstand der Erkenntnis sein, sondern
muss auch Gegenstand der Erfahrung werden."  Aus der Begruendung der
chinesischen Philosophie in der Erfahrung ergeben sich nicht nur die
Unterschiede zur indischen Philosophie, sondern auch zu den
philosophischen Prinzipien der westlichen Welt.

Die in den indoeuropaeischen Sprachen zum Ausdruck kommende Logik
gruendet auf einer Unterscheidung zwischen Gegenstand und Handlung,
die sich sprachsystematisch in den Kategorien von Substantiv und Verb
ausdrueckt.  UEber 2000 Jahre lang hat diese Logik die Struktur der
Gesellschaft bzw., wie Aristoteles sagen wuerde, der Polis beherrscht
und gestuetzt.  Aristoteles definierte den Menschen als
gesellschaftliches Wesen, als zoon politikon, und seine Logik ist der
Versuch, jene kognitive Struktur herauszuarbeiten, die den richtigen
Schluss aus in Saetzen ausgedrueckten Praemissen erlaubt.  Er versuchte
dabei, die Logik so unabhaengig wie moeglich von der verwendeten bzw.
von der jeweiligen in anderen Lebensgemeinschaften gesprochenen
Sprache zu sehen.  Ganz aehnliche Ziele verfolgen diejenigen, die
heute formale Sprachen entwerfen.

Neben der sprachlichen Behausung der aristotelischen Logik gab es ein
anderes Sprachsystem, in dem das Verb (das sich auf die Handlung
bezieht) im Objekt assimiliert war, naemlich Chinesisch und Japanisch.
Jede Handlung wurde substantivisch ausgedrueckt (das Jagen, Rennen,
Sprechen), so dass auf diese Weise ein nicht-praedikativer Sprachmodus
entstand.  Eine aristotelische Konstruktion sieht folgendermassen aus:
Falls a gleich b ist (der Himmel ist bedeckt), und falls b gleich c
ist (das, was ihn bedeckt, sind Wolken), dann ist auch a gleich c
(ein bewoelkter Himmel).  Nicht-praedikative Konstruktionen kommen
nicht zu derartigen Schlussfolgerungen, sondern gehen von einer
Bedingung in die andere ueber wie etwa in der folgenden Weise: bedeckt
sein, Bedeckung in Wolkenform, Bewoelkung assoziiert Regen, Regen...
Es handelt sich hierbei also um nach hinten offene Verknuepfungen im
status nascendi.  Wir sehen, dass die aristotelische Logik die
Wahrheit des Schlusses aus der Wahrheit ihrer Praemissen entwickelt
und dies auf eine formale Relation gruendet, die von beiden unabhaengig
ist.  In einer nicht-praedikativen Logik verweist die Sprache
lediglich auf moegliche Relationsketten, wobei sie implizit anerkennt,
dass gleichzeitig auch andere moeglich waeren.  Direktes Wissen wird
hier nicht abgeleitet, und ebenso wenig werden die Schlussfolgerungen
einem formalen Test auf ihre Wahrheit oder Unwahrheit unterzogen.
Der abstrakten und formalen Darstellung der Schlussfolgerung auf
Wissen stellt dieses Logikmodell eine konkrete und natuerliche Form
der Darstellung gegenueber, in welcher Unterschiede bezueglich der
Qualitaet wichtiger sind als Quantitaetsunterschiede.

Aus unseren Ausfuehrungen ueber die Natur der ideographischen Schrift
duerfte hervorgehen, dass sich eine derartige Schrift nicht fuer jene
Art des logischen Denkens eignet, wie es von Aristoteles und seinen
Nachfolgern entwickelt wurde und das seinen Hoehepunkt im westlichen
Wissenschaftsverstaendnis und im westlichen Wertesystem fand.  Die
Entdeckung fernoestlicher Darstellungsformen und der aus den ganz
anderen Denkweisen hervorgehenden Philosophie sowie das zunehmende
Interesse an den diesen Kulturen eigenen und unserer Kultur fremden
Subtilitaeten hat zu mancherlei Versuchen gefuehrt, die Grenzen
zwischen diesen beiden fundamental verschiedenen Sprachkulturen zu
ueberwinden.  Sollte dies gelingen, so wuerde unsere Sprache und damit
unser intellektuelles und emotionales Leben um Dimensionen
angereichert, die den Strukturen unseres westlichen Existenzrahmens
diametral entgegengesetzt sind.

Wir waehlen hierfuer als Beispiel die Logik des
Abhaengigkeitsverhaeltnisses.  Ausgedrueckt im japanischen Konzept des
ame umfasst es ein ganzes Beziehungsgefuege und eine daraus abgeleitete
Logik des Handels, unterschiedliche Denkmodi und unterschiedliche
Wertesysteme.  Die uns bekannten, immer wiederkehrenden
Missverstaendnisse zwischen der westlichen Welt und Japan (aber auch
anderen, in gleicher Weise gepraegten asiatischen Laendern) lassen sich
teilweise darauf zurueckfuehren.  Grob vereinfacht koennte man z. B.
sagen, dass es sich auch im Verhaeltnis zwischen einem Unternehmen und
seinen Angestellten ausdrueckt: Wenn beide Seiten dieses Prinzip
akzeptieren (was sie auch tun, weil das Prinzip des ame im Leben
dieser Menschen struktural verankert ist), ergibt sich fuer beide
Vertragspartner daraus die Verpflichtung zur bedingungslosen Treue.
Ame kann sich allerdings auch auf die gegenseitigen Beziehungen
innerhalb einer Familie (einschliesslich aller Vorurteile) oder auf
die Beziehungen zwischen Freunden beziehen.  Dieser Begriff
bezeichnet eine praktische Erfahrung, die weit ueber die genannten
Beispiele hinausgeht: Sie konstituiert einen Handlungsrahmen, der
nicht nur bestimmte (logisch gerechtfertigte) Entscheidungen
ermoeglicht, sondern den Kontext fuer das Denken, Fuehlen, Handeln und
Bewerten der in diesen Rahmen eingebundenen Menschen abgibt.  Er
betrifft das Verhaeltnis zur Sprache ebenso wie das Bildungssystem,
die diese Form der Abhaengigkeit als eine logische Form verinnerlicht
hat, die ueber jegliche Individualitaet Prioritaet gewinnt.  Die einzige
Moeglichkeit, die Logik des ame in unsere Logik zu integrieren--sofern
wir dies fuer richtig und fuer moeglich hielten--laege darin, die in
diesem Prinzip zum Ausdruck gebrachte praktische Erfahrung
nachzuvollziehen.  So scheint ame auf Grenzen in unserer Sprache
hinzuweisen, tatsaechlich aber offenbart sie Grenzen in unseren Formen
der Selbstkonstituierung, Grenzen bezueglich der Formen, mit denen wir
unsere gegenseitigen Beziehungen als Teil unserer Erfahrung
definieren.

Im uebrigen gilt natuerlich in umgekehrter Richtung genau das Gleiche.
Auch hier ergab sich aus der Erkenntnis dieser Grenzen ein stark
gewachsenes Interesse an der westlichen Kultur und der Wunsch, sich
einiges davon in Vokabular und Verhalten anzueignen.  Eine wiederum
andere Faszination uebte die indische Welt ueber den in den vedischen
Texten ausgedrueckten Mystizismus und allgemein ueber die
nachdrueckliche Beschaeftigung mit den Daseinsbedingungen des Menschen
aus.  Das hat bekanntlich dazu gefuehrt, dass viele Menschen unseres
Kulturkreises in jener Kultur eine Alternative suchen zu dem, was sie
als ueberkonditionierte Existenzform, als Leistungs- und
Konkurrenzdruck empfinden.  Der bewusste Ausstieg aus der
Schriftkultur und ueberhaupt aus der Kultur, die Suche nach Befreiung
(mukti), der Ausstieg aus einer auf Nuetzlichkeit und Logik
ausgerichteten Welt ist auch heute fuer viele "Aussteiger" ein
erstrebenswertes Ziel.  (Dieser Aussteiger muss dabei die von ihm
bewunderte alternative Existenzform keineswegs wirklich verstanden
und vollkommen angenommen haben; in vielen Faellen kopiert man
lediglich einen Lebensstil und gibt sich einem exotischen Eskapismus
hin; junge Israeli duerften hierfuer ein geeignetes Beispiel sein).

Kurz: Aus der Entwicklung von Sprache und Logik innerhalb der vielen
uns bekannten Kulturen koennen wir die sehr komplexe Beziehung ablesen
zwischen dem, wer wir sind und was wir sind: zwischen unserer Sprache
und der Logik, die die Sprache ermoeglicht und spaeter verkoerpert.
Jaeger in europaeischen Laendern und Jaeger in fernoestlichen Laendern, in
Afrika, Indien und Papua, Sammler, Fischer, Landwirte--sie alle
entwickeln eine je unterschiedliche Beziehung zu ihrer Umwelt und zu
den Fuehrungsgestalten in ihrer jeweiligen Lebensgemeinschaft.  Die
Art und Weise, in der ihre relativ einfachen Erfahrungen in Sprache
und andere Ausdrucksformen gekleidet sind, spielt eine wichtige Rolle
fuer die Art und Weise, wie gemeinschaftliche Erfahrung, Religion,
Kunst, die Errichtung eines Wertesystems, spaeter Erziehung und
Identitaetswahrung organisiert sind.  Es gibt allerdings auch etwas
ihnen allen Gemeinsames, und das bezieht sich in aller Regel auf jene
Beziehungen, die sich im Arbeitsprozess abspielen und die sich auf die
Effizienz auswirken.  Diese Gemeinsamkeiten sind entscheidend fuer
unser Verstaendnis der Rolle, die die Sprache und die Logik in den
verschiedenen Stadien der gesellschaftlichen und wirtschaftlichen
Entwicklung gespielt haben und heute spielen.


Die Pluralitaet intellektueller Strukturen

Angesichts der Bedeutung, die die Skala bei der Selbstkonstituierung
des Menschen durch Sprache spielt, liegt es nahe zu fragen, inwieweit
auch die Logik durch die Skala beeinflusst ist.  Auf den ersten Blick
hat Logik mit Skala nichts zu tun.  Schluesse bleiben gueltig
unabhaengig davon, wie viele Menschen sie gezogen bzw. nachvollzogen
haben.  Das ist aber nur die universalistische Sehweise.  Wenn wir
die Herausbildung von Logik betrachten und sie auf die praktische
menschliche Erfahrung zurueckfuehren, welche sich aus dem Bewusstsein
von Verknuepfungen ergibt, dann ist es nicht mehr so sicher, ob Logik
wirklich von Skala unabhaengig ist.  Einige Erfahrungen waeren
tatsaechlich ohne das Erreichen einer kritischen Masse gar nicht
moeglich gewesen, und die Beziehung zwischen einfach und komplex ist
nicht nur rein progressiver Art.  Sie ist eine multivalente Relation,
natuerlich auch mit zuwachsenden Elementen.

Die praktische Erfahrung einer Stammesgemeinschaft, z. B. in Afrika,
Nordamerika oder Suedamerika, ist definiert durch die Skala der
Beziehungen innerhalb dieses Stammes sowie der Beziehungen zwischen
diesem Stamm und einem relativ begrenzten Daseinsumfeld.  Die dieser
Skala eigene Logik (im Sprachgebrauch einiger Anthropologen sollten
wir von Prae-Logik sprechen) ergibt sich dabei aus der Vorherrschaft
der Instinkte und Intuitionen und drueckt sich hauptsaechlich in
visuellen Mitteln aus, wie wir sie als fuer primitive
Mentalitaetsstadien typische Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsmittel
erkannt haben.  Die Erinnerung scheint dabei eine wichtige Rolle zu
spielen.  Die unterscheidende Kraft der Sinne (Sehen, Hoeren, Riechen
usw.) ist besonders stark ausgebildet; die Anpassungsfaehigkeit ist
sehr viel groesser als bei den Angehoerigen moderner Gesellschaften.
Die Staemme leben in getrennten, voneinander abgeschlossenen Gruppen,
sind sich der biologischen Gemeinsamkeiten untereinander nicht bewusst
und in ihren UEberlebensstrategien auf sich selbst beschraenkt.  Wenn
solche Gruppen zueinander in Beziehungen treten, diversifiziert sich
ihre Lebenspraxis, Zusammenarbeit und Austausch jeglicher Art nehmen
zu, die Sprache in ihren vielfaeltigen Ausdrucksformen wird wichtiger
Teil der Selbstsetzung.

Wir haben gesehen, dass Sprache an die fruehen Zentren
landwirtschaftlicher Lebensformen gebunden war.  Hier konnte sich die
Bevoelkerung vermehren, weil die an diesen Orten gefundene
Lebenspraxis effektiv genug war, um eine groessere Anzahl von Menschen
zu unterhalten.  Moeglicherweise waren es diese fruehen Formen der
Landwirtschaft, in denen die Skala ein Schwellenstadium erreicht
hatte und sich unter dem Einfluss der neuen praktischen Erfahrungen
der Sprache eine neue Qualitaet des pragmatischen Handelns
herausbilden konnte.  Diese Taetigkeit hatte dann auch eine sehr
praezise Logik aufzuweisen, das Bewusstsein von einer Vielfalt von
Ebenen, deren Verknuepfungen sich entscheidend auf die Ergebnisse
dieses Handelns, also auf das Wohlergehen der Handelnden, auswirkte.
Die Logik gestaltet vor allem die Beziehungen zwischen den
praktischen Taetigkeiten des Menschen und dem Ort, auf den sich diese
Taetigkeiten beziehen und dessen Sakralitaet im lateinischen Wortstamm
(Agrikultur--Kultur--cultus) zum Ausdruck kommt.  Logik ist auf
vielfache Weise kulturgebunden und kulturgestaltend--von der
Sequenzierung eines Handlungsablaufes ueber die Verwendung der
verfuegbaren Ressourcen bis hin zum Entwurf von Plaenen, Werkzeugen usw.
Logik und Kultur bedingen sich gegenseitig: diese Abhaengigkeit nahm
im Verlauf der Zeit zu und resultierte in den heute entwickelten
logischen Maschinen, die eine Kultur definieren, welche sich von der
Kultur mechanischer Geraete deutlich unterscheidet.  Wir sollten
Unterschiede im Bereich der Intelligenztypen anerkennen, und wir
sollten Unterschiede in Betracht ziehen, die sich aus der Vielfalt
der natuerlichen Zusammenhaenge des praktischen Lebens ergeben.
Gemeinsamkeiten in der UEberlebenserfahrung und die Weiterentwicklung
sollten auch in die Dynamik der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung mit
einbezogen werden.

Allerdings zeigt sich aus heutiger Sicht, dass in den
lebenspraktischen Zusammenhaengen des postindustriellen Zeitalters die
Logik, die aus den praktischen Erfahrungen der Selbstkonstituierung
in der Welt bezogen wird, und die Logik, die sich bei unseren
Versuchen, die menschliche Welt zu definieren, einstellt, zunehmend
unterschiedlicher Art sind.  Wir lesen nicht laenger die Logik der
Sprache und schliessen von da auf die Erfahrung, sondern projizieren
unsere eigene Logik (selbst ein praktisches Ergebnis unserer
Selbstkonstituierung) in die Erfahrung in dieser Welt.  Booles
Algebra des Denkens ist hierfuer ein Beispiel, aber keineswegs das
einzige.  Allenthalben werden heute Sprachen geschaffen, die eine
Vielfalt logischer Systeme unterstuetzen, unter anderem
autoepistemische, zeitliche, modale und intuitionistische Systeme.

Man koennte fast so etwas wie eine universale Logik und eine
Universalsprache erwarten--in der Vergangenheit und in der Gegenwart
gibt es ausreichende Versuche fuer einen derartigen Universalismus.
Leibniz verfolgte Visionen einer idealen Sprache, einer
characteristica universalis und eines calculus ratiocinator.  Viele
aehnliche Versuche folgten, aber alle uebersahen, dass mit zunehmender
Diversifikation der menschlichen Erfahrungen solche Visionen immer
utopischer wurden.  Parallel hierzu trennen wir uns von solchen
Formen der Logik, die wir als geistiges Erbe tradiert haben.  Die
Logik, die in zahlreichen autarken, primitiven Erfahrungen
verschiedenster Bevoelkerungsgruppen Asiens, Afrikas und Europas
eingebettet ist, verkoerpert heute wenig mehr als kulturelle
Erinnerung.  Die Skala, die in solchen Erfahrungen zum Ausdruck kommt,
und die dieser Skala angemessene Logik wird in der sehr viel
umfassenderen Skala der global agierenden Wirtschaft aufgehoben.  Die
Logik magischer Erfahrungen koennen wir nicht mehr aufdecken und
nachvollziehen, nicht einmal jene rationalen oder rationalisierbaren
Aspekte, die sich auf Pflanzen, Tiere und Mineralien beziehen, die
den uns vorhergegangenen Voelkern als Heilmittel gedient haben.

In unserer heutigen Zeit ruecken die Kulturen, die fast allesamt das
Heilige durch das Profane, das Primitive durch das UEberentwickelte
ersetzen, dichter zusammen.  Dies geschieht nicht etwa, weil jeder es
so moechte, und nicht einmal, weil alle davon profitieren (viele geben
dafuer ihre Identitaet preis).  Nein, hinter diesem Prozess steht die
Notwendigkeit, solche Effizienzebenen zu erreichen, die der neuen
Skala der Menschheit angemessener sind.  Innerhalb dieser Skala
werden die verschiedenen Menschengruppen zuallererst als menschliche
Wesen (nicht als Staemme, Nationen oder Religionsangehoerige)
integriert; daraus erwaechst allmaehlich ein pragmatischer Rahmen,
dessen Kennzeichen die erhoehte Integration der Menschen ist.

Die eurozentrische Vorstellung, dass alle Typen der Intelligenz sich
auf den westlichen Typ (und damit auf die westlichen Formen der
Sprachpraxis, die in der Schriftkultur kulminierten) entwickeln, hat
sich als Irrtum erwiesen.  Statt dessen machte sich eine Vielfalt
intellektueller Strukturen geltend, leider fast immer auf
demagogische Weise oder als Lippenbekenntnis gegenueber der
Vergangenheit, niemals jedoch als eine OEffnung auf die Zukunft hin.
Die Schriftkultur hat aus guten Gruenden--jenen der industriellen
Revolution--Heterogenitaet und damit die Vielfalt der menschlichen
Erfahrungen und Formen der Identitaetsfindung ausgeloescht.  Wenn sich
die Gruende hierfuer erschoepft haben, weil neue Lebens- und
Arbeitsbedingungen eine neue Logik erfordern, erweist sich
Schriftkultur als ein Hemmschuh, ohne dass sich dies allerdings auf
die ihr eigene Logik auswirken muss.

Die Skala des menschlichen Lebens und der menschlichen Handlungen und
die damit verbundene Projektion von Erwartungen jenseits des blossen
UEberlebens der Selbsterhaltung fuehrt nicht zu einer universalen
Schriftkultur, sondern zu zahlreichen unterschiedlichen Alphabetismen
und zu einer Vielfalt logischer Horizonte.  Da die
Koordinationsmechanismen aus Logik, Rhetorik, Heuristik und Dialektik
bestehen, foerdert die neue Skala u. a. auch neue rhetorische Mittel.
Wir brauchen uns nur zu vergegenwaertigen, wie sich UEberredung auf der
Ebene des globalen Dorfes aeussern koennte oder auf der Ebene des
Individuums, das in diesem globalen Dorf durch die Mechanismen der
Netzwerke und der multimedialen Interaktivitaet beeinflusst ist.  Die
logischen Mechanismen der Massenkommunikation werden ersetzt durch
UEberlegungen darueber, wie die individuelle Kommunikation intensiviert
werden kann.  Man halte sich nur die neuen heuristischen Verfahren im
World Wide Web oder in der Marktforschung oder den elektronischen
Transaktionen der Netconomy vor Augen.  Faszinierende Forschung im
Bereich der multivalenten Logik, der Fuzzy Logic (der Alternative zur
Logik der scharf definierten Mengen), der temporalen Logik und in
vielen anderen logischen Ansaetzen, die sich auf Computer, kuenstliche
Intelligenz, Memetik und Vernetzung beziehen, eroeffnen einen Weg in
die Zukunft, der weit ueber das hinausgeht, was in der
Science-fiction-Welt von non A entworfen wurde.  Die Logik von
Handlungen Zwischen den relativ monolithischen und uniformen Idealen
einer schriftkulturell gebildeten Gesellschaft, die von den Tugenden
der Logik ueberzeugt ist, und der pluralistischen und heterogenen
Wirklichkeit partieller Schriftkulturen, die die Logik auf Maschinen
uebertragen, kann man leicht einen Richtungsunterschied ausmachen.
Personen mit angemessener schriftkultureller Bildung, die im Geist
der Rationalitaet und klassischer oder formaler Logik erzogen worden
sind, stehen den Sub-Alphabetismen spezialisierter Arbeitsprozesse
oder den unlogischen Schlussfolgerungen, die innerhalb der neuen
Bereiche der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung getroffen werden,
hilflos gegenueber.  Wir wollen uns deren Haltung etwas genauer
betrachten.  Beim UEbergang von einem Entwicklungsstadium in das
andere erfuhren die Menschen, dass tradierte Verhaltenskodes erodieren,
und sie projizieren ihre neuen Lebensumstaende in neue
Verhaltensmuster.  Der in dem ueberholten Verhaltenskode zum Ausdruck
kommende Typus der Kohaesion wurde durch einen anderen und die eine
sich diesem Kode unterwerfende Logik durch eine andere ersetzt.  Wann
immer sich eine Interaktion zwischen Gruppen mit verschiedenen
Kohaesionstypen ergab, war auch die Logik ernsthaft auf die Probe
gestellt.  Manchmal setzte sich eine Form der Logik durch; in anderen
Faellen wurde ein Kompromiss gefunden.  Primitive Entwicklungsstadien
erweisen sich als erstaunlich anpassungsfaehig.

Unser heutiges Entwicklungsstadium, das in mancherlei Hinsicht vom
Ursprung weit entfernt ist, zeichnet sich durch ein Umfeld aus,
innerhalb dessen ein auf hohe Effizienz ausgerichteter pragmatischer
Rahmen geschaffen werden soll.  Logik, Rhetorik, Heuristik und
Dialektik sind innerhalb dieses Rahmens eng aufeinander bezogen.  Mit
anderen Worten: Der Mensch hat eine Entwicklung vollzogen von der
sinnlichen Verankerung in der natuerlichen Welt hin zur artifiziellen
(d. h. vom Menschen geschaffenen und gestalteten) Welt, die der
konkreten Wirklichkeit uebergelegt wurde--und die sich im uebrigen
ausweitet auf ein kuenstliches Leben hin, wie man eine der juengsten
Forschungsrichtungen bezeichnet (ALife).  Innerhalb dieser neuen Welt
beschraenken die Menschen die Projektion ihrer natuerlichen und
geistigen Bedingungen nicht mehr auf ein umfassendes Zeichensystem
(oder nur wenige).  Im Gegenteil, alles zielt auf Segmentierung ab,
das Ziel liegt nicht in einer globalen Kohaesion, sondern in einer auf
den Einzelfall bezogenen Kohaesionskraft, die zur Optimierung des
gegebenen Problems beitraegt.  Komplexitaet und Natur dieser
Veraenderungen innerhalb des Systems rufen nach einer Strategie der
Segmentierung und einer diese unterstuetzenden Logik (oder mehreren
Formen der Logik).  In dem Zusammenspiel zwischen Sprache und den
sich in ihr konstituierenden Menschen sind logische Konflikte nicht
ausgeschlossen.  Die Logik der Lebenspraxis, die auch durch die
Heuristik beeinflusst wird, und die der Schriftkultur und Bildung
eigene Logik sind nicht unbedingt identisch.

Handlungen implizieren Handlungstraeger und verweisen damit auf die
Logik, die in Werkzeuge und die von Menschen geschaffenen Gegenstaende
eingepraegt ist.  Die Annahme, dass die in der Sprache zum Ausdruck
kommende Logik sich auch in dem ausdrueckt, was zur Herstellung von
Werkzeugen und anderen auf die menschliche Taetigkeit bezogenen
Gegenstaende fuehrt, blieb lange Zeit unangefochten.  Auch heute noch
werden Designer und Ingenieure in ihrer Ausbildung einem Ideal von
Bildung und Schriftkultur unterworfen, dessen Rationalitaet man in
ihrer Arbeit zu erkennen glaubt.  Dabei haben aber neben der
Entwicklung der menschlichen Sprachen stets auch Zeichnungen als
Anweisung fuer die Anfertigung von Gegenstaenden und die Ausfuehrung
bestimmter Taetigkeiten gedient.  Jede Zeichnung verkoerpert auf ihre
Weise die Logik des zukuenftigen, mit ihrer Hilfe hervorgebrachten
Gegenstandes, ganz gleich wie nuetzlich oder unbedeutend dieser sein
mag.  Unsere Schriftkultur weist einen umfangreichen Korpus von
Texten auf, aus dem die logischen Aspekte des Denkens abgeleitet
werden koennen.  Dem stehen nur ein relativ geringer Bestand von
Zeichnungen und nicht allzuviele Gegenstaende gegenueber, die bis in
unsere heutige Zeit ueberdauert haben.  Produkte werden stets fuer
genau bestimmte praktische Erfahrungen entwickelt und haben diese
Erfahrungen oder die Personen, die sie verkoerperten, selten
ueberdauert.  Natuerlich ueberdauerten Strassen, Haeuser, Geraete und
andere Gegenstaende, aber erst mit der Erfindung besserer
Zeichengeraete und eines besseren Papiers wurde eine Bibliothek des
Ingenieurwesens moeglich.  Zwischen Kunst und Wissenschaft angesiedelt,
unterwirft sich die hybride Form der Ingenieurwissenschaft der Logik
wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnis nur in einem bestimmten Mass und
balanciert diese gegen die Logik der aesthetischen Wahrnehmung aus.
Im pragmatischen Rahmen jenseits der Schriftkultur spielen die
Ingenieurwissenschaften hinsichtlich der menschlichen
Selbstkonstituierung in sprachgebundenen praktischen Erfahrungen eine
herausragende Rolle.  Sie wirken sich nachhaltig auf die Effizienz
der praktischen Erfahrungen und auf ihre fast unbegrenzte
Diversifikation aus.

Wenn bestimmte Mittel (wie z. B. Sprache oder die heute von
Designern und Ingenieuren verwendeten Visualisierungsmittel)
ueberkommene Mittel ersetzen oder gar ueberfluessig machen, gibt es eine
Phase des Konflikts, eine Phase der Anpassung und eine Phase der
gegenseitigen Ergaenzung.  In der heutigen Zeit mit ihren
distributiven Transaktionsformen, ihrer Heterogenitaet und den
Interaktionsformen, die weit ueber die Linearitaet einfacher Abfolgen
hinausgehen, geraten die strukturalen Merkmale der Schriftkultur mit
der Dynamik einer neuen Entwicklungsphase, die durch leistungsfaehige
Technologien mit einer Vielfalt logischer Moeglichkeiten getragen wird,
in Konflikt.  Anders ausgedrueckt: Wir beobachten, wie die der
Schriftkultur und Bildung eigene Logik mit den neuen Formen der Logik
(die sich in der Tat als eine Vielzahl praesentieren) im derzeitigen
pragmatischen Handlungsrahmen in Konflikt geraet.

Innerhalb der Logik des schriftsprachlichen Diskurses, der wir nolens
volens auch in diesem Buch folgen, ist der Versuch, die Schriftkultur
zu bewahren, gleichbedeutend mit dem Versuch, lineare Relationen,
Determinismus, Hierarchie (von Werten) und Zentralisierung aufrecht
zu erhalten, und dies in einem Rahmen, der Nichtlinearitaet,
Dezentralisierung, verteilte oder distribuierte Erfahrungsformen und
nicht fixierte Werte verlangt.  Diese beiden Rahmen sind logisch
inkompatibel.  Das heisst natuerlich nicht, dass Schriftkultur,
Schriftlichkeit und Bildung vollkommen aufgegeben werden muessen oder
dass sie gar vollends verloren gehen, wie dies mit den Hieroglyphen
oder der piktographischen Schrift geschah, oder dass an ihre Stelle
Zeichnungen oder computergestuetzte Sprachverarbeitung tritt.  Das
Prinzip der Linearitaet wird auch weiterhin eine grosse Zahl
praktischer Taetigkeiten bestimmen; das Gleiche gilt fuer
deterministische Erklaerungen und fuer verschiedene Formen des
Zentralismus (politisch, religioes, technologisch usw.) und selbst fuer
einen elitaeren Wertbegriff.  Aber es wird nicht mehr ein universeller
Standard sein oder gar ein allgemeinverbindliches Ziel (das alles
Nichtlineare dem Versuch der Linearisierung unterzieht, alles auf
eine Abfolge von Ursache und Wirkung zurueckfuehrt, alles einem Zentrum
zuordnet und Zentralismus ausuebt); es wird vielmehr Teil eines
komplexen Systems von Relationen sein ohne jegliche Hierarchie--oder
zumindest eingebunden in rasch wechselnde Hierarchien--wertfrei,
anpassungsfaehig, stark verteilt.

Das Gleiche gilt auch fuer den Typ der Logik (und damit der Rhetorik,
Heuristik und Dialektik), der in der Sprache angelegt ist, d. h. der
aus dem Universum der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung in das System
der Schlussfolgerungen, des Wissens und des Bewusstseins
hineinprojiziert ist.  Die in unserer Sprache zutage tretende Logik
ist dualistisch, auf dem Gegensatzpaar von wahr und falsch aufgebaut
und unterstuetzt eine Erfahrungsform, die den abstrakten Charakter
logischer Rationalitaet traegt.  Sie wird ergaenzt von einem logischen
Symbolismus und einem logischen Kalkuel, der diesen Dualismus
formalisiert und andere, dieser dualistischen Struktur nicht
entsprechende logische Modelle ausschliesst.

Die bivalente Logik--etwas ist geschrieben oder nicht geschrieben,
das Geschriebene ist richtig oder falsch--gehoert zu den unsichtbaren
Grundlagen der Schriftkultur.  Erst sehr spaet, mit dem logischen
Formalismus, konnten sich multivalente Schemata geltend machen.  Wenn
nun der effiziente Rahmen der postindustriellen Lebenspraxis auf
Nichtlinearitaet und Vagheit (fuzziness) angelegt ist, dann erweist
sich unsere Schriftkultur als eine schlechte Grundlage fuer eine
multivalente Logik.  Auch einige der Teildisziplinen, die sich aus
der Schriftkultur ergaben und als ihre Erweiterung verstehen
(Geschichte, Philosophie, Soziologie), sind nicht in der Lage, eine
Logik aufzunehmen, die sich von derjenigen unterscheidet, die in der
praktischen Erfahrung des Lesens und Schreibens ihren festen Sitz hat.
Das weist die Computerwissenschaft als einen neuen
wissenschaftlichen Horizont aus, innerhalb dessen eine multivalente
Logik auf dem Computer simuliert werden kann, obwohl dessen Struktur
eine andere Logik (diejenige Booles) aufweist.  Die wissenschaftliche
Diskursform der Schriftkultur und der multimediale, nichtlinerare
heuristische Zugang zur Wissenschaft sind fundamental unterschieden.
Sie setzen eine unterschiedliche Form der Logik voraus und bringen
unterschiedliche Formen der Interaktion hervor zwischen denen, die
ihre Identitaet in der Ausfuehrung wissenschaftlicher Experimente, und
jenen, die ihre Identitaet durch die Beteiligung daran finden.

Die Welt der praedikativen Logik und die auf die analytische Kraft
bauende Wissenschaft taten sich schwerer, eine Logik der Vagheit (
fuzzy logic) zu akzeptieren und sie in neue Produkte einzubauen, als
z. B. die Welt der nichtpraedikativen Logik und die auf die
synthetische Kraft gestuetzte Wissenschaft.  In der Welt der
nicht-praedikativen Sprache ist die Logik der Vagheit in den Entwurf
von Kontrollmechanismen fuer Hochgeschwindigkeitszuege und der neuen
effizienteren Toaster eingegangen.  In Japan wurde eine auf der Basis
dieser Logik arbeitende Waschmaschine 1993 auf den Markt gebracht,
als man diese Logik in der westlichen Welt noch heftig diskutierte.
Diese Tatsache ist mehr als nur ein einfaches Beispiel im Rahmen von
UEberlegungen, die die Implikation einer globalen Wirtschaft fuer die
verschiedenen Sprachsysteme und die in ihnen verkoerperten logischen
Koordinationsmechanismen behandeln.  Der Fortschritt im Verstehen und
in der Weiterentwicklung des menschlichen Denkens weist eine
fortlaufende Entwicklung auf von einem Modell, das auf
Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur basiert, zu einem Modell, das in
einem voellig neuen pragmatischen Rahmen wurzelt.  Regelbasierte
Muster-Matching-Systeme verallgemeinern den Praedikaten-Kalkulus;
neuronale Netzwerke ahmen in einer synthetischen
Neuron-plex-Anordnung die Gehirnfunktionen nach; Fuzzy Logic setzt
sich mit den Grenzen des Boolschen Kalkuels und den neuronalen Netzen
auseinander und versucht, Ungenauigkeit, Ambiguitaet und
Unentscheidbarkeit in dem Masse zu modellieren, in dem diese Phaenomene
in der neuen Lebenspraxis des Menschen an Bedeutung gewinnen.


Sampling

Im Rahmen der Schriftkultur vollziehen sich Erinnern und Besinnen und
die daran geknuepfte Logik hauptsaechlich durch Zitieren.  Etwas zu
wissen, heisst hier, darueber schreiben zu koennen und auf diese Weise
die Logik der Schrift zu bekraeftigen.  Lebenswege werden in der
Erinnerung aufbewahrt, Tagebuecher sind auf einen intendierten Leser
hin (Geliebter, Kinder, Nachwelt) interpretierte Lebenswege.  Die
schriftkulturellen Mittel, ueber aufeinander abfolgende praktische
Erfahrungen gemeinsam zu verfuegen, beinhalten die entsprechende Logik
und beeinflussen Erfahrung und deren Kommunikation.  Alles scheint
sich aus demselben Zusammenhang zu ergeben: aus dem Wissen um die
Mittel, die die Erfahrung nacherleben lassen.  Die auf Schrift
basierende Erkenntnislehre mit der ihr impliziten Logik gruendet
darauf, die Erfahrung als Spracherfahrung bestaendig neu zu schaffen
und nacherleben zu lassen.  Deshalb ist jede Form des Schreibens auf
der Grundlage der in der Schriftkultur verkoerperten Struktur
(literarisch oder philosophisch, religioes, wissenschaftlich,
journalistisch oder politisch) in Wirklichkeit ein Nachschreiben
(rewriting).

Hingegen ist in einem Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur das Prinzip
des Sampling--ein Begriff, den wir aus der Genetik
kennen--vorherrschend.  Wir wollen Zitieren und Sampling kurz
miteinander vergleichen.  Die schriftliche Aneignung in Form des
Zitierens vollzieht sich innerhalb der schriftkulturellen Strukturen.
Schriftsprachliche Abfolgen sind so ausgelegt, dass sie die Worte
eines anderen ohne weiteres integrieren koennen.  Ein Zitat
signalisiert zugleich die gewuenschte Hierarchie, sei es durch
Anrufung, sei es durch Infragestellung der zitierten Autoritaet.
Autorenschaft wird ausgeuebt, indem ein Kontext fuer die Interpretation
und zugleich schriftkulturelle Regeln fuer deren Vermittlung
geschaffen werden.  Insofern erfuellen auch die Interpretationen die
Erwartungen, dass mit ihnen die deterministische Struktur der
Schriftkultur, ihre innere Logik, reproduziert wird.  Zugleich
unterstuetzt das Zitat eine zentralistische Sichtweise, indem es sich
als Interessens- und Verstehenszentrum setzt.

Die jenseits schriftkultureller Verfahren liegende Aneignung
widersetzt sich der Hierarchie und der Sequentialitaet, widersetzt
sich dem Gedanken der Autorschaft und den Regeln des logischen
Schlusses.  Sie kennt keine elementaren bedeutungstragenden Einheiten
und geht mit ihren Auswahlverfahren weit ueber wohlgeformte Saetze,
ueber Woerter, Morpheme oder Phoneme und die formale Logik hinaus.  Die
Techniken des Sampling gehen bis zur Rueckgaengigmachung.  Die
Aneignung kann sich auf Wortrhythmen beziehen oder auf Satzstrukturen,
auf das Feeling eines Textes oder auf die vielen anderen
nicht-schriftlichen Ausdrucksformen.  Alles, was sich auf einen
geschriebenen Satz bezieht--und im uebrigen auch alles, was sich auf
Musik, Malerei, Geruch, Textur, Bewegung (von Personen, Bildern,
Baumblaettern, Sternen, Fluessen usw.) bezieht--kann ausgewaehlt, in
Einheiten jeder gewuenschten Groesse aufgeloest und als ein Echo der in
ihr verkoerperten Erfahrung angeeignet werden.  Genetische
Konfigurationen, wie sie sich bei Pflanzen oder anderen lebendigen
Einheiten finden, koennen ebenfalls vom Sampling erfasst werden.  Durch
das genetische Splicing wird die Relation zur umfassenderen
genetischen Textur von Pflanzen oder Tieren aufrecht erhalten.  So
werden auch Woerter, Saetze oder Texte durch Splicing an die allgemeine
Erfahrung rueckgebunden, in der sie konstituiert wurden.

Derartige Relationen sind stark relativiert und unterliegen einer
Vagheitslogik.  Wenn sie sich auf das beziehen, was wir schreiben,
werden sie durch emotionale Komponenten angereichert, die die
schriftkulturelle Erfahrung aus dem schriftlichen Ausdruck verdraengt
hatte.  Wo sich frueher die Strenge und die Logik des guten Schreibens
gegen alle denkbaren Stoerfaktoren zur Wehr setzten, ist nun Platz fuer
Variation, fuer Spontaneitaet, fuer das Zufaellige.  Wenn sich diese
Beziehungen auf biologische Strukturen erstrecken, betreffen sie
spezielle Eigenschaften wie Komposition oder Verderblichkeit.  In
dieser Kultur des Sampling gibt es keinen allgemeinverbindlichen
Korpus schriftkultureller Texte und damit verbundener Logik; die
vorherrschende Dynamik dieses Entwicklungsstadiums betrachtet die
Vergangenheit allenfalls als ein erweitertes Alphabet, aus dem man
zufaellig oder systematisch diejenigen Buchstaben auswaehlen kann, die
zum jeweiligen Vorgang passen.  Diese Buchstaben bilden ein Alphabet
sui generis, veraendern sich gemeinsam mit den praktischen Erfahrungen,
auf die sie sich beziehen, und interagieren mit zahlreichen
logischen Regeln fuer ihren Gebrauch oder fuer das Verstaendnis ihrer
Funktionsweise.  Hierbei wird Interpretation nicht nur ein Akt der
Sprachverwendung, sondern der Hervorbringung von Sprache.  Das
biologische Sampling und das damit zusammenhaengende Splicing
betrachtet auch das Lebendige als einen Text.  Beide Verfahren
bearbeiten die ausgewaehlten Komponenten, um ihren Geschmack, ihr
Aussehen, ihren Naehrwert usw. zu verbessern.  Darin liegt das
eigentliche Ziel der genetischen Steuerung; in dieser Erfahrung hat
die Logik des Lebens, wie sie sich in den DNA-Sequenzen und
Konfigurationen ausdrueckt, die Oberhand ueber die Logik von Sprache
und Schriftkultur gewonnen, auch wenn die in der Genetik noch so
prominente Textmetapher dabei eine so wichtige Rolle spielt.  Es sei
in diesem Zusammenhang daran erinnert, dass das Wort Text vom
lateinischen Wort fuer weben kommt und erst spaeter auf
zusammenhaengende geschriebene Satzgebilde angewandt wurde.

Nicht alles, was durch Sampling zusammenkommt, wird in eine graue
Informationsmasse umgewandelt.  In ihrer Lebenspraxis tragen die
Menschen Gefuehle und Empfindungen zusammen, Lebensmittel im
Supermarkt, Unterhaltungsprogramme, Kleidung und sogar Partner (fuer
bestimmte Gelegenheiten oder als Lebenspartner, als Geschaeftspartner
und vieles andere mehr).  Im Gegensatz zum Zitieren fuehrt das mehr
oder weniger ungesteuerte Zusammentragen zu einer Trennung von dem,
was die Schriftkultur als Tradition und Kontinuitaet gepriesen hat.
Vor allem stellt sie den Begriff der Verfasserschaft in Frage.  In
dem Masse, in dem das Sampling in unserer Erfahrung Raum greift,
gewinnt der Mensch eine sehr spezifische Freiheit, die innerhalb der
Grenzen der schriftkulturellen Erfahrung nicht moeglich war.
Tradition wird ergaenzt durch Innovationsformen, die ein durch
Progression und dualistische (wahr--falsch) Erfahrung
gekennzeichneter pragmatischer Rahmen nicht kannte.  Besonders
deutlich wird das daran, dass auf das Sampling stets die Synthese
folgt, die weder wahr noch falsch, sondern (bis zu einem gewissen
Grad) angemessen ist.  In der Musik wird fuer diesen Zweck ein Geraet
verwendet, das man Sequencer nennt.  Das Zusammengesetzte, das
Komponierte, ist synthetisch.  Das ermoeglicht eine neue Erfahrung,
die formal gesehen den sogenannten Ad-hoc-Sprachen und ihrer
Verwendung entspricht.  Der Mix Master ist eine Maschine fuer das
Recycling von willkuerlich definierten Kompositionseinheiten wie Noten,
Rhythmen oder Melodiemustern, die aus ihrem pragmatischen
Zusammenhang genommen wurden.  All dies gilt auch fuer den
biologischen Text, auch fuer die Biologie des Menschen.  In gewisser
Weise gewinnt die Genmutation den Status eines neuen Verfahrens, mit
dessen Hilfe man neue Pflanzen und Tiere, auch neue Materialien,
synthetisch gewinnen kann.

Die Collagetechnik in der Kunst gruendet auf einer aehnlichen
Auswahllogik, die ueber die realistische Darstellung hinausgeht.
Logische Gesetze der Perspektive werden durch Gesetze der
Gegenueberstellung aufgehoben.  Als kuenstlerische Technik antizipiert
die Collage die Stadien des Sampling und der erwaehnten
Kompositionsform.  Mit all diesen Entwicklungen wird aber unsere
Vorstellung von geistigem Eigentum, Markenzeichen und Copyright
veraendert, die allesamt einer Logik entspringen, welche an die
Erfahrung der Schriftkultur gebunden ist.  Der Begriff der
Autorschaft ist ueberholt; sobald etwas in die OEffentlichkeit geraten
ist, ist es Gemeinbesitz.

Auch postmoderne Literatur und Malerei kennen die Technik des
Sampling--mit einer Offenheit fuer alles, was unser heutiges
Alltagsidiom der Maschinen und Verfremdung zu bieten hat.  Auch das
Sampling bei Pflanzen, Fruechten oder Mikroben ist nicht auf die
Bewahrung urspruenglicher Identitaet gerichtet, sondern auf die
Hervorbringung neuer Identitaeten, die ihren Platz in unseren neuen
Erfahrungen der Selbstsetzung zugewiesen bekommen.  Unter dem
Gesichtspunkt der Logik ist das Verfahren insofern interessant, als
es neue Bereiche der logischen Angemessenheit einrichtet.  Logische
Identitaet wird aus einer dynamischen Perspektive neu definiert.
Unter pragmatischem Gesichtspunkt koennen z. B. bestimmte Erfahrungen
durch Anwendung einer bestimmten Form von Logik maximiert werden.  In
anderen Faellen koennen komplementaere Formen der Logik--die sich so
ergaenzen, dass eine jede auf einen bestimmten, genau definierten
Aspekt des Systems bezogen ist--fuer bestimmte Strategien des
gestaffelten Managements, fuer bestimmte Ablaeufe oder fuer parallel
verlaufende Ablaeufe in Frage kommen.  So verbinden z. B. Strategien
zur Maximierung wirtschaftlicher Transaktionen verschiedene
entscheidungstragende Schichten, derer jede einzelne eine andere
logische Voraussetzung hat.  An die Stelle eines einzigen,
festgelegten logischen Rahmens auf der Grundlage der Schriftkultur
tritt eine Vielzahl logischer Rahmen, die sich auf die Vielfalt
unserer neuen Lebenspraxis einstellt.

Wir wollen einen letzten Gedanken verfolgen.  Reicht es festzustellen,
dass die Sprache die ideologische und soziale Identitaet des Menschen
ausdrueckt?  Die Auseinandersetzung mit der Sprache, genauer: mit der
Verkoerperung der Sprache in der Schriftkultur, ist eine
Auseinandersetzung mit allen bio- und soziologischen, politischen und
kulturellen Aspekten, die die Spezies Mensch ausmachen.  Dabei
erweist sich der logische Aspekt offenbar als grundlegend:
bio-logisch, sozio-logisch usw.  Daraus ergibt sich eine Hierarchie,
die moeglicherweise nicht jedem einleuchten wird, nimmt doch die
Sprache in diesem System einen hoeheren Platz zwischen allen am Prozess
der menschlichen Selbstsetzung beteiligten Faktoren ein.  Um als zoon
politikon, als homo sapiens, als homo ludens oder als homo faber zu
gelten, muss der Mensch zu all jenen Interaktionen befaehigt sein, die
jeder dieser Begriffe beschreibt: auf der biologischen Ebene, auf der
gesellschaftlichen Ebene, innerhalb von Interessensstrukturen, die er
mit anderen Menschen teilt, im Bereich seiner eigenen Anlagen.  Eben
deshalb definiert sich der Mensch durch ein praktisches Handeln, das
die Verwendung von Zeichen wesentlich mit einbeschliesst.

Der Mensch gewinnt seine Identitaet auf den verschiedenen Ebenen, auf
denen solche Zeichen hervorgebracht, interpretiert, verstanden und
zur Erstellung neuer Zeichen verwendet werden.  Felix Hausdorf hat
deshalb den Menschen auch als ein zoon semeiotikon, als ein
semiotisches, ein Zeichen verwendendes Wesen bezeichnet.  Charles
Sanders Peirce hat im uebrigen die Semiotik als eine Logik der
Unbestimmtheit verstanden.  Die Zeichen--Bilder, Laute, Gerueche,
Texturen, Woerter (oder Wortkombinationen)--die einer Sprache, einem
Diagramm, der mathematischen oder chemischen Formelsprache, einer
neuen Sprache (etwa in der Kunst, der Politik oder im Bereich des
Programmierens), einem genetischen Code usw. zugehoeren--sind auf den
Menschen bezogen, nicht abstrakt, sondern konkret an unserem Leben
und an unserer Arbeit beteiligt.


Memetischer Optimismus

John Locke hat bereits erkannt, dass jegliches Wissen aus der
Erfahrung hergeleitet ist.  Bezueglich der Logik oder der Mathematik
war er sich dessen nicht so sicher.  Wenn wir aber Erfahrung als
praktisches Handeln des sich damit selbst setzenden Menschen
definieren, als ein Handeln, aus dem sich die veraenderbare Identitaet
von in diese Erfahrung eingebundenen Einzelnen oder Gruppen ergibt,
dann leitet sich auch die Logik wie alles Wissen und wie die Sprache
aus der Erfahrung her.  Damit siedeln wir die Logik nicht ausserhalb
des Denkens an, aber in der Erfahrung; aufgeworfen ist damit die
Frage nach der logischen Replikation.  Dawkins hat den Replikator als
ein biologisches Molekuel definiert, das "die ausserordentliche
Eigenschaft hat, von sich selbst Kopien anzufertigen".  Eine solche
Einheit verfuegt offenkundig ueber Fruchtbarkeit, Treue und
Langlebigkeit.  Auch die Sprache ist ein Replikator; genauer: ein
replikatives Medium.  Die Frage ist, ob Verdoppelung nur kraft der
eigenen strukturellen Merkmale moeglich ist oder ob man z. B. die
Logik als Replikationsregel in Erwaegung ziehen muss.  Vielleicht ist
ja sogar die Logik ihrer Natur nach replikativ.

Solche UEberlegungen gehoeren in den weiteren Rahmen der Memetik.
(Memetik soll den Begriff Genetik anklingen lassen und als
Forschungsgegenstand die Meme, nicht die Gene, haben.) Sie geht von
der Annahme aus, dass Meme, die geistigen AEquivalente zu Genen, auch
Evolutionsmechanismen unterworfen sind.  Im Gegensatz zur natuerlichen
Evolution vollzieht sich memetische Evolution in effizienteren
Groessenordnungen und mit viel groesserer Geschwindigkeit.

Zur Erklaerung von kultureller UEbertragung oder des kulturellen
Erbes--seien sie nun genetischer oder memetischer Natur oder eine
Verbindung aus beiden--wurde bisweilen auf die Existenz eines
Bedeutungsgens geschlossen.  Wuerde ein solches Gen existieren, wuerde
das nicht heissen, dass Signifikation durch memetische Replikation
uebertragen wird, sondern dass die praktischen Erfahrungen der
Selbstkonstituierung des Individuums den Akt der
Bedeutungsherstellung in der Verkleidung verschiedener auf
Zeichenprozesse bezogener Logikformen einschliesst.  So verstanden
waere Replikation nicht eine Replikation von Information, sondern von
fundamentalen Prozessen, zu denen u. a. die Konstituierung von
Bedeutung gehoert.  Die Evolution der Sprache und die Evolution der
Logik gehoert zur allgemeinen kulturellen Evolution.  Die Mutation von
Memen und die Erweiterung einer begrenzten Skala, etwa die Skala
begrenzter kuenstlicher Sprachen und begrenzter logischer Regeln, kann
in Beschreibungen wiedergegeben werden, die den genetischen
Gleichungen aehneln.  Wenn sich aber die Skala veraendert, duerfte sich
die daraus resultierende Komplexitaet in solchen Formalisierungen
nicht mehr ausdruecken lassen.

Wie dem auch sei, Ausdruck, Kommunikation, Signifikation und die
fundamentalen Funktionen jedes Zeichensystems sind, unabhaengig von
der ihnen eigenen Logik, mit replikativen Qualitaeten versehen.  Logik
verhindert Entstellung oder stellt doch zumindest die Mittel bereit,
solche zu identifizieren.  Zum besseren Verstaendnis dieser Behauptung
brauchen wir uns nur die Replikationsformen vor Augen zu halten, die
bei der Behandlung von Daten in einem Computer im Spiele sind.  Die
Botschaft Error signalisiert den falschen Umgang mit Daten und deutet
mithin auf einen falsch verlaufenden Replikationsprozess hin.  Wie
jedes Beispiel hinkt auch dieses: Es koennte ja sein, dass diejenige
Logik, nach dessen Gesetzen die Replikation ueberprueft wurde, sich fuer
Replikationsprozesse, die ihrer Natur nach anders sind, nicht eignet.
Wenn wir z. B. die der Schriftkultur eigene Logik fuer semiotische
Prozesse heranziehen wuerden, die fuer unser Stadium jenseits der
Schriftkultur charakteristisch sind, wuerde der Error-Hinweis, der uns
einen falschen Umgang mit Daten signalisiert, ueberall auf dem Monitor
aufblinken.  Womit auch immer wir es in der praktischen Erfahrung der
elektronischen Datenverarbeitung zu tun haben und was auch immer
Virtualitaet definiert, alles bezieht sich auf einen logischen Rahmen,
der in keinerlei Hinsicht als memetische Replikation der
aristotelischen Logik oder irgendeines anderen in die Schriftkultur
eingebetteten logischen Systems verstanden werden kann.  Meme koennen
repliziert werden, gleich ob sie in neuronalen Strukturen, als Muster
von Rinnen, auf einer CD-ROM, oder in einem HTML- (hyper text markup
language-) Web-Format existieren.  Die Interaktionen zwischen den
Traegern solcher Meme (zwischen natuerlichen und/oder kuenstlichen
Gehirnen) entsprechen einem anderen dynamischen Bereich, dem ihrer
gegenseitigen Identifikation.
