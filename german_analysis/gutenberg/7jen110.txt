Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of November, 2001, contributions are being solicited from people

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer 
to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING 
about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm 
etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States 
copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

Vorwort zur deutschen Ausgabe

Unsere Welt ist in Unordnung geraten.  Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist eine
grosse Belastung fuer alle.  Sozialleistungen werden weiter drastisch
gekuerzt.  Das Universitaetssystem befindet sich im Umbruch.  Politik,
Wirtschaft und Arbeitswelt durchlaufen Veraenderungen, die sich nicht
nach dem gewohnten ordentlichen Muster des sogenannten Fortschritts
richten.  Gleichwohl verfolgen Politiker aller Couleur politische
Programme, die mit den eigentlichen Problemen und Herausforderungen
in Deutschland (und in Europa) nicht das Geringste zu tun haben.  Das
vorliegende Buch moechte sich diesen Herausforderungen widmen, aus
einer Perspektive, die die Zwangslaeufigkeit dieser Entwicklung betont.

Wenn man eine Hypothese vorstellt, benoetigt man ein geeignetes
Prueffeld.  In meinen Augen ist Deutschland am besten dafuer geeignet.
In keinem anderen Land der Welt laesst sich die Dramatik des Umbruchs
so unmittelbar verfolgen wie hier.  In Deutschland treffen die Kraefte
und Werte, die zu den grossen historischen Errungenschaften und den
katastrophalen historischen Fehlleistungen dieses Landes gefuehrt
haben, mit den neuen Kraeften und Werten, die das Gesicht der Welt
veraendern, gewissermassen in Reinform zusammen.

An Ordnung, Disziplin und Fortschritt gewoehnt, beklagen die Buerger
heute eine allgegenwaertige laehmende Buerokratie, die von Regierung und
Verwaltung ausgeht.  Frueher galt das, verbunden mit dem Namen
Bismarcks, als gute deutsche Tugend, eine der vielen
Qualitaetsmaschinen „Made in Germany“.  Im Verlauf der Zeit aber wurde
der Buerger abhaengig von ihr und konnte sich nicht vorstellen, jemals
ohne sie auszukommen.  Die Mehrheit schreckt vor Alternativen zurueck
und moechte nicht einmal ueber sie nachdenken.  Gepraegt von Technik und
Qualitaetsarbeit ist die Vorstellung, dass das Industriezeitalter
seinem Ende entgegengeht, den meisten eine Schreckensvision.  Sie
wuerden eher ihre Schrebergaerten hergeben als die digitale Autobahn zu
akzeptieren, die doch die Staus auf ihren richtigen Autobahnen zu den
Hauptverkehrszeiten abbauen koennte--ich betone das „koennte“.  Noch
immer lebt es sich gut durch den Export eines technischen und
wissenschaftlichen Know-how, dessen Glanzzeit allerdings vorueber ist.

Als ein hochzivilisiertes Land ist Deutschland fest entschlossen, den
barbarischen Teil seiner Vergangenheit hinter sich zu lassen.  Der
Klarheit halber sei gesagt, was ich unter barbarisch verstehe:
Hitler-Deutschland verdient keinen anderen Namen, ebensowenig wie
alle anderen AEusserungen von Aggression, Antisemitismus und Rassismus,
die noch immer nicht der Vergangenheit angehoeren.  Aber bis heute hat
man nicht verstanden, dass eben jene pragmatische Struktur, die die
industrielle Kraft Deutschlands begruendete, auch die destruktiven
Kraefte beguenstigte.  (Man denke nur an die Technologieexporte, die
die wahnsinnigen Fuehrer oelreicher Laender erst juengst in die Haende
bekommen haben.) Das wiedervereinigte Deutschland ist bereit, in
einer Welt mit globalen Aufgaben und globalen Problemen Verantwortung
zu uebernehmen.  Es setzt sich unter anderem fuer den Schutz des
tropischen Regenwaldes ein und zahlt fuer Werte--den Schutz der
Umwelt--statt fuer Produkte.  Aber die politischen Fuehrer Deutschlands
und mit ihnen grosse Teile der Bevoelkerung haben noch nicht begriffen,
dass der Osten des Landes nicht unbedingt ein Duplikat des Westens
werden muss, damit beide Teile zusammenpassen.  Differenz, d. h.
Andersartigkeit, ist eine Qualitaet, die sich in Deutschland keiner
grossen Wertschaetzung erfreut.  Verlorene Chancen sind der Preis, den
Deutschland fuer diese preussische Tugend der Gleichmacherei bezahlen
muss.

Die englische Originalfassung dieses Buches wurde 1997 auf der
Leipziger Buchmesse vorgestellt und in der Folge von der Kritik
wohlwollend aufgenommen.  Dank der grosszuegigen Unterstuetzung durch
die Mittelsten-Scheid Stiftung Wuppertal und die Alfred und Claere
Pott Stiftung Essen, fuer die ich an dieser Stelle noch einmal Dank
sage, konnte dann Anfang 1998 die Realisierung des von Beginn an
bestehenden Plans einer deutschsprachigen Ausgabe konkret ins Auge
gefasst werden.  Und nachdem Prof. Dr. Norbert Greiner, bei dem ich
mich hier ebenfalls herzlich bedanken moechte, fuer die UEbersetzung
gewonnen war, konnte zuegig an die Erarbeitung einer gegenueber der
englischen Ausgabe deutlich komprimierten und staerker auf den
deutschsprachigen Diskussionskontext zugeschnittenen deutschen
Ausgabe gegangen werden.  Einige Kapitel der Originalausgabe sind in
der deutschsprachigen Edition entfallen, andere wurden stark
ueberarbeitet.  Entfallen sind vor allem solche Kapitel, die sich in
ihren inhaltlichen Bezuegen einem deutschen Leser nicht unmittelbar
erschliessen wuerden.  Ein Nachwort, das sich ausschliesslich an die
deutschen Leser wendet, wurde ergaenzt.

Die deutsche Fassung ist also eigentlich ein anderes Buch.  Wer das
Thema erweitern und vertiefen moechte, ist selbstverstaendich
eingeladen, auf die englische Version zurueckzugreifen, in die 15
Jahre intensiver Forschung, Beobachtung und Erfahrung mit der neuen
Technologie und der amerikanischen Kultur eingegangen sind.  Ein
Vorzug der kompakten deutschen Version liegt darin, dass die juengsten
Entwicklungen--die so schnell vergessen sein werden wie alle anderen
Tagesthemen--„Fortsetzungen“ meiner Argumente darstellen und sie
gewissermassen kommentieren.  Sie haben wenig miteinander zu tun und
sind dennoch in den folgenden Kapiteln antizipiert: Guildos Auftritt
beim Grand Prix d’Eurovision (liebt er uns eigentlich immer noch, und
warum ist das so wichtig?), die enttaeuschende Leistung der deutschen
Nationalmannschaft bei der Fussballweltmeisterschaft (standen sich im
Endspiel Brasilien und Frankreich oder Nike und Adidas gegenueber?),
die Asienkrise, das Ergebnis der Bundestagswahlen, der Euro, neue
Entwicklungen in Wissenschaft und Technologie, die juengsten
Arbeitslosenzahlen, die OEkosteuer und vieles mehr.  Wer sich der Muehe
einer gruendlichen Lektuere des vorliegenden Buches unterzieht, wird
sich auf diese Entwicklungen einen eigenen Reim machen koennen, sehr
viel besser als die Mediengurus, die uns das Denken abnehmen wollen.
Zumindest wird er ueber die wortreichen Artikel halbgebildeter
Akademiker und opportunistischer Journalisten schmunzeln, die allzeit
bereit sind, anderen zu erklaeren, was sie selbst nicht verstehen.

Wie in der englischen Version moechte ich auch meine deutschen Leser
einladen, mit mir in Kontakt zu treten und mir ihre kritischen
Kommentare oder Fragen per e-mail zukommen zu lassen: nadin@acm.org.
Im Einklang mit dem Ziel des Buches, fuer die Kommunikation jenseits

Einleitung

Schriftkultur in einer sich wandelnden Welt

Alternativen


Wenn wir uns mit der Sprache befassen, befassen wir uns mit uns
selbst, als Person und als Gattung.  Wir sehen uns heute vielen
Bedrohungen ausgesetzt--Terrorismus, AIDS, Armut, Rassismus, grosse
Fluechtlingsstroeme--, aber eine dieser ernsthaften Bedrohungen scheint
am leichtesten zu ertragen zu sein: Schriftlosigkeit und
schriftkulturelle Unbildung.  Dieses Buch verkuendet das Ende der
Schriftkultur und versucht, die unglaublichen Kraefte zu erklaeren, die
die beunruhigenden Veraenderungen in unserer Welt vorantreiben.  Das
Ende der Schriftkultur--also die Kluft zwischen einem noch gar nicht
so weit zurueckliegenden Gestern und einem aufregenden, aber auch
verwirrenden Morgen--zu verstehen, ist offensichtlich schwerer, als
mit ihm zu leben.  Die Tatsache des Umbruchs nicht anerkennen zu
wollen, erleichtert das Verstehen nicht gerade.  Wir sehen alle, dass
die schriftkulturelle Sprache nicht so funktioniert, wie sie nach
Meinung unserer Lehrer eigentlich funktionieren sollte, und wir
fragen uns, was wir dagegen tun koennen.  Eltern glauben, dass bessere
Schulen mit besseren Lehrern Abhilfe schaffen koennten.  Die Lehrer
schieben die Schuld auf die Familie und fordern hoehere Ausgaben im
Bildungssektor.  Professoren klagen ueber schlechte Motivation und
Vorbildung der Studienanfaenger.  Verleger suchen angesichts der neuen,
miteinander konkurrierenden Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsformen nach
neuen Verlagsstrategien.  Juristen, Journalisten, Berufssoldaten und
Politiker zeigen sich ueber die Rolle und die Funktion der Sprache in
der Gesellschaft besorgt.  Vermutlich sind sie jedoch eher besorgt um
ihre eigene Rolle und die Funktion der von ihnen repraesentierten
Institutionen in der Gesellschaft und setzen alles daran, die
Strukturen einer Lebenspraxis zu festigen, die nicht nur die
Schriftkultur, sondern vor allem ihre eigene Machtposition und ihren
Einfluss staerken.  Die wenigen, die daran glauben, dass die
Schriftkultur nicht nur Fertigkeiten, sondern auch Ideale und Werte
vermittelt, sehen gar unsere Zivilisation auf dem Spiel stehen und
fuerchten angesichts der abnehmenden traditionellen Bildungsstandards
das Schlimmste.  Niemand redet von Zukunftschancen und ungeahnten
Moeglichkeiten.

UEber das Beschreiben der Symptome kommt man dabei nicht hinaus:
Abnahme der allgemeinen Lese- und Schreibfaehigkeit (in den USA
erreicht die sogenannte

functional illiteracy fast 50%); eine alarmierende Zunahme
vorgefertigter Sprachhuelsen (Sprachklischees, vorgefertigte
Mitteilungen); die verbreitete Vorliebe fuer visuelle Medien anstelle
der Sprache (besonders Fernsehen und Video).  Neben der Forschung zu
diesen Fragen gibt es massive oeffentliche Kampagnen zur Staerkung
aller moeglichen schriftkulturellen Unternehmungen: Unterricht fuer
Analphabeten, zusaetzlicher Sprachunterricht auf allen Ebenen und
OEffentlichkeitsarbeit, die fuer dieses Problem sensibilisieren soll.
Was immer diese Aktionen bewirken moegen, sie helfen nicht zu
verstehen, dass es sich bei alldem um eine zwangslaeufige Entwicklung
handelt.  Die historischen und systematischen Aspekte der
Schriftkultur und der zurueckgehenden Sprachkenntnisse bleiben
unbeachtet.

Mein Interesse an diesen Fragen ist durch zwei persoenliche Umstaende
geweckt worden: Zum einen bin ich in einer osteuropaeischen Kultur
aufgewachsen, die trotzig an den strengen Strukturen der
Schriftkultur festhielt.  Zum andern habe ich den anderen Teil meines
bisherigen Lebens dem Bereich gewidmet, den man heute die neuen
Technologien nennt.  Ich kam schliesslich in die Vereinigten Staaten,
in ein Land mit unstrukturierter und bruechiger Schriftkultur und
unglaublicher, zukunftsgerichteter Dynamik.  Ich lebte mit denen
zusammen, die unter den Folgen eines schlechten Bildungssystems zu
leiden hatten und denen gleichzeitig diese neuen Moeglichkeiten
offenstanden.  Die meisten von ihnen hatten keinerlei Kontakt zu dem,
was an Schulen und Universitaeten vor sich ging.  Das war der Anlass
fuer mich, wie fuer viele andere auch, ueber Alternativen nachzudenken.

Alles, was die Menschen in meiner neuen Lebensumgebung
taten--Einkaufen, Arbeiten, Spiel und Sport, Reisen, Kirchgang und
selbst die Liebe--, geschah mit einem Gefuehl der Unmittelbarkeit.
Als Anbeter des Augenblicks standen meine neuen Landsleute in
scharfem Kontrast zu den Menschen des europaeischen Kontinents, von
denen ich kam und deren Ziel in der Dauerhaftigkeit liegt--ihrer
Familie, ihrer Arbeit, ihrer Werte, ihrer Arbeitsmittel, ihres Zu
Hauses, ihrer Heimat, ihrer Autos und ihrer Haeuser.  In den USA ist
alles gegenwaertig.  An Fernsehsendungen und Werbung ist das sofort zu
erkennen.  Aber auch die Lebensdauer von Buechern wird bestimmt von
den Bestsellerlisten.  Der Markt feiert heute den Erfolg eines
Unternehmens, das es morgen nicht mehr gibt.  Alle anderen, wichtigen
und alltaeglichen, Ereignisse des Lebens, alle Modetrends, die
Produkte der Popkultur, ueberhaupt alle Produkte sind dieser Fixierung
auf den Augenblick unterworfen.  Sprache und Schriftkultur koennen
sich diesem Prinzip des Wandels nicht entziehen.  Als
Universitaetsprofessor stand ich an der Front, an der der Kampf um die
Schriftkultur ausgetragen wurde.  Hier begriff ich, dass bessere
Studienplaene, besser bezahlte Dozenten und bessere und billigere
Lehrbuecher zwar einiges bewirken koennten, aber letztlich an der
Misere nichts aendern wuerden.

Der Niedergang der Schriftkultur ist ein allumfassendes Phaenomen, das
sich nicht auf die Qualitaet des Bildungssystems, auf die
Wirtschaftskraft eines Landes, auf den Status sozialer, ethnischer
oder religioeser Gruppen, auf das politische System oder auf die
Kulturgeschichte reduzieren laesst.  Es gab menschliches Leben vor der
Schriftkultur, und es wird es jenseits von ihr geben.  Es hat im
uebrigen bereits begonnen.  Wir sollten nicht vergessen, dass die
Schriftkultur eine relativ junge Errungenschaft der Menschen ist. 99%
der Menschheitsgeschichte liegen vor der Schriftkultur.  Ich
bezweifele, dass historische Kontinuitaet eine Voraussetzung der
Schriftkultur ist.  Wenn wir indessen begreifen, was das Ende der
Schriftkultur in seinen praktischen Auswirkungen bedeutet, koennen wir
die Klagen vergessen und uns aktiv auf eine Zukunft einrichten, von
der alle nur profitieren koennen.  Wenn wir etwas genauere
Vorstellungen von dem entwickeln wuerden, was sich am Horizont
abzuzeichnen beginnt, koennten wir vor allem ein besseres,
effektiveres Bildungssystem entwerfen.  Wir wuessten dann auch, was die
einzelnen Menschen brauchen, um sich in ihrer Mannigfaltigkeit in
dieser Welt erfolgreich zurechtzufinden.  Verbesserte menschliche
Interaktion, fuer die es mittlerweile ausreichende technologische
Moeglichkeiten gibt, sollte dabei im Mittelpunkt stehen.

Es liegt natuerlich eine gewisse Ironie in dem Umstand, dass jede
Veroeffentlichung ueber die Moeglichkeiten jenseits der Schriftkultur
ausgerechnet denen, um die es uns dabei besonders geht, nicht
zugaenglich ist.  Von den vielen Millionen derer, die im Internet
aktiv sind, lesen die meisten hoechstens einen aus drei Saetzen
bestehenden Absatz.  Die Aufmerksamkeitsspanne von Studierenden ist
nicht wesentlich kuerzer als die ihrer Dozenten: eine Druckseite.
Gesetzgeber und Buerokraten verlassen sich bei laengeren Texten auf die
Zusammenfassungen ihrer Mitarbeiter.  Ein halbminuetiger
Fernsehbericht uebt groesseren Einfluss aus als ein ausfuehrlicher
vierspaltiger Leitartikel.  Eine weitere Ironie liegt natuerlich darin,
dass das vorliegende Buch Argumente vorstellt, die in ihrer logischen
Abfolge von den Konventionen des Schreibens und Lesens abhaengen.  Als
Medium der Konstituierung und Interpretation von Geschichte
beeinflusst die Schrift natuerlich Art und Inhalt unseres Denkens.

Ich will daher vorausschicken, gewissermassen um mir selbst Mut zu
machen, dass das Ende der Schriftkultur nicht gleichbedeutend mit
ihrem voelligen Verschwinden ist.  Die Wissenschaft von der
Schriftkultur wird eine neue Disziplin, so wie Sanskrit oder
Klassische Philologie eine sind.  Fuer andere wird sie ein Beruf
bleiben, wie sie es jetzt schon fuer Herausgeber, Korrektoren und
Schriftsteller ist.  Fuer die Mehrheit wird sie fortbestehen als eine
von vielen Spezialsprachen und Bildungsformen, als eine von vielen
Literalitaeten, die uns den Gebrauch und die Integration der neuen
Medien und der neuen Kommunikations- und Interpretationsformen
erleichtern.  Der Utopist in mir sagt, dass wir die Schriftkultur neu
erfinden und damit retten werden, denn sie hat eine entscheidende
Rolle bei der Entwicklung zur neuen Zivilisation gespielt.  Der
Realist in mir erkennt, dass neue Zeiten und neue Herausforderungen,
um ihre Komplexitaet in den Griff zu bekommen, neue Mittel erfordern.
Unser Widerwillen, den Umbruch zu akzeptieren, wird ihn nicht
verhindern.  Er wird uns nur daran hindern, ihn mit zu gestalten und
das Beste daraus zu machen.

Das vorliegende Buch moechte keine Schoene Neue Welt verkuenden, in der
die Menschen zwar weniger wissen, aber doch alles das wissen, was sie
im Bedarfsfall wissen muessen.  Es handelt auch nicht von Menschen,
die--oberflaechlich, mittelmaessig und extrem
wettbewerbsorientiert--sich leicht auf Veraenderung einstellen.  Es
beschaeftigt sich vielmehr mit der Sprache und mit Bereichen, die von
ihr wesentlich erfasst sind: Politik, Bildung, Markt, Krieg, Sport und
vieles mehr.  Es ist ein Buch ueber das Leben, das wir den Woertern
beim Sprechen, Schreiben und Lesen verleihen.  Wir geben aber auch
Bildern, Toenen, Zeichengebilden, Multimedien und virtuellen
Realitaeten Leben, wenn wir uns in neue Interaktionsformen einbinden.
Die Grenzen der Schriftkultur in praktischen Taetigkeiten zu
ueberschreiten, fuer deren Ausfuehrung die Schriftkultur keine
ausreichenden Mittel zur Verfuegung stellen kann, heisst letztlich, in
eine neue Zivilisationsphase hineinzuwachsen.  Jenseits der
Schriftkultur?  Zunaechst moechte ich meinen methodischen Ansatz
darlegen.  Die Sprache erfasst den Menschen in allen seinen Aspekten:
den biologischen Anlagen, seinem Raum- und Zeitverstaendnis, seinen
kognitiven und manuellen Faehigkeiten, seinem Gefuehlshaushalt, seiner
Empfindungskraft, seiner Gesellschaftlichkeit und seinem Hang zur
politischen Organisation des Lebens.  Am deutlichsten aber tritt
unser Verhaeltnis zur Sprache in der Lebenspraxis zutage.  Unsere
bestaendige Selbstkonstituierung durch das, was wir tun, warum wir es
tun und wie wir es tun--unsere Lebenspraxis also--vollzieht sich
mittels der Sprache, ist aber nicht darauf zu reduzieren.  Die hier
verwendete pragmatische Perspektive greift auf Charles Sanders Peirce
zurueck.  Die semiotischen Implikationen meiner UEberlegungen beziehen
sich auf sein Werk.  Er verfolgt die Frage, wie Wissen zu gemeinsamem
Wissen wird: nur ueber die Traeger unseres Wissens--alle von uns
gebildeten Zeichentraeger--koennen wir ermitteln, wie die Ergebnisse
unseres Denkens in unsere Handlungen und Theorien eingehen.

Die Sprache und die Bildung und Formulierung von Gedanken ist allein
dem Menschen eigen.  Sie machen einen wesentlichen Teil der
kognitiven Dimension seiner Lebenspraxis aus.  Wir scheinen ueber die
Sprache so zu verfuegen wie ueber unsere Sinne.  Aber hinter der
Sprache steht ein langer Prozess der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung,
der die Sprache erst moeglich und schliesslich notwendig machte.
Dieser Prozess bot letztendlich auch die Mittel, uns in dem Masse als
schriftkulturell gebildet zu konstituieren, wie es die jeweiligen
Lebensumstaende erforderten.  Es sieht nur so aus, als sei die Sprache
ein nuetzliches Instrument; in Wirklichkeit ergibt sie sich aus
unserem lebenspraktischen Zusammenhang.  Wir koennen einen Hammer oder
einen Computer benutzen, aber wir sind unsere Sprache.  Und die
Erfahrung der Sprache erstreckt sich auf die Erfahrung der ihr
eigenen Logik und der von ihr und der Schriftkultur geschaffenen
Institutionen.  Diese wiederum beeinflussen rueckwirkend unser
Dasein--das, was wir denken, was wir tun und warum wir es tun; so wie
auch alle Werkzeuge, Geraete und Maschinen und alle Menschen, zu denen
wir in Beziehung treten, unser Dasein beeinflussen.  Die Interaktion
mit anderen Menschen, mit der Natur oder mit Gegenstaenden, die wir
geschaffen haben, beeinflussen alle auf ihre Weise die praktische
Selbstkonstituierung unserer Identitaet.

Die schriftkulturelle Verwendung von Sprache hat unsere kognitiven
Faehigkeiten entscheidend erweitert.  Vieles unterliegt dieser
schriftkulturellen Praxis: Tradition, Kultur, Gedanken und Gefuehle,
Literatur, die Herausbildung politischer, wissenschaftlicher und
kuenstlerischer Projekte, Moral und Ethik, Justiz.  Ich verwende einen
weiten Begriff von Schriftkultur, der ihre vielen ueber die Zeit
herausgebildeten Facetten abdecken soll.  Wer daran Anstoss nimmt,
sollte sich die enormen Wirkungsbereiche der Schriftlichkeit in
unserer Kultur vor Augen halten.  Das Gegenteil dieses Begriffs ist
fast immer mit negativen Konnotationen belastet--nicht
schriftkulturell gebildet zu sein, gilt als schaedlich oder peinlich.
Wir koennen also, ohne unsere Werte und Denkweisen genauer zu
verstehen, auch nicht nachvollziehen, wie sich der Weg in die
"Schriftkulturlosigkeit" als Fortschritt begreifen laesst.  Viele
Menschen empfinden sich als Teil einer post-schriftkulturellen
Gesellschaft, moechten sich aber nicht als ungebildet bezeichnen
lassen.  [Im uebrigen ist hier mit Blick auf die deutsche Ausgabe ein
klaerendes Wort zur Begrifflichkeit angezeigt.  Im Englischen ist zur
Benennung der hier verhandelten Problemstellungen das Begriffspaar
literacy und illiteracy (bzw. literate/illiterate) gebraeuchlich, fuer
das es im Deutschen kein AEquivalent gibt. literacy/literate kann
deutsch "Schriftkultur/schriftkulturell", "Schriftlichkeit
(Schrift)/schriftlich", "Bildung/gebildet", bzw. illiteracy neben
"Unbildung" auch noch "Analphabetismus" bedeuten.  Auch
"Literalitaet/Illiteralitaet" ist keineswegs deckungsgleich.  Je nach
Kontext bezeichnet der englische Begriff einen dieser Aspekte oder
den gesamten Bedeutungsumfang.  In der deutschen Fassung musste daher
aus Gruenden der Praezisierung auf Umschreibungen oder
Wortkombinationen zurueckgegriffen werden.  Ein aehnliches Problem
stellt sich bei der UEbersetzung fuer den englischen Begriff mind, an
dessen Bedeutungsumfang man sich je nach Kontext mit "Bewusstsein"
oder "Geist" annaehern kann, der nach Auffassung des Verfassers aber
als deutsch "Mind" wiedergegeben werden sollte.  Anm. d.  UEbers.]

Mit der Bezeichnung Jenseits der Schriftkultur beziehe ich mich auf
ein Entwicklungsstadium, in dem die Grundstruktur unserer
Lebenspraxis nicht mehr vornehmlich durch schriftkulturelle Merkmale
gekennzeichnet ist.  Darueber hinaus bezeichne ich damit einen Zustand,
in dem nicht mehr eine einzige Sprache und Schriftkultur vorherrscht
und allen Bereichen der Lebenspraxis ihre Strukturen und Regeln
aufzwingt, so dass neue Formen der Selbstkonstituierung verhindert
werden.  Im uebrigen geht es mir nicht um einen provokativen Begriff,
sondern darum, dass wir unseren Blick zukunftsorientiert auf die
gegenwaertigen Probleme richten und uns nicht aus Bequemlichkeit mit
dem Gewohnten zufrieden geben.

Das neue Stadium kennt viele Sprachen und Schriftlichkeiten mit
jeweils eigenen Merkmalen und Funktionsregeln.  Bei diesen partiellen
Sprachen kann es sich um andere Ausdrucksformen handeln, um visuelle
oder um synaesthetische Kommunikationsmittel.  Andere beruhen auf
Zahlen und damit einem Notationssystem, das mit Schriftlichkeit
nichts zu tun hat.  Jenseits der Schriftkultur etablieren sich
nichtsprachliche Denk- und Arbeitsformen, die z. B. Mathematiker
verschiedener Laender und Sprachen auf der Grundlage ihrer Formeln
zusammenarbeiten lassen.  Visuelle, digital verarbeitete Mittel
erhoehen die Effizienz.  Und selbst in der heutigen eher primitiven
Ausstattung verkoerpert das Internet die Richtungen und Moeglichkeiten
dieser Zivilisation.  Das bringt uns zurueck zur Frage, wie und warum
Schriftkultur entstand, naemlich durch pragmatische Umstaende, die nach
hoeherer Effizienz hinsichtlich der verfolgten Ziele verlangten: bei
der Auflistung von Handelsguetern oder bei Anweisungen fuer bestimmte
Taetigkeiten; Beschreibungen von Orten und Wegen; Theater, Dichtung,
Philosophie; die Aufzeichnung und Verbreitung von Geschichte und
Ideen, von Mythen, Romanen, Gesetzen und Gebraeuchen.  Einige dieser
Beduerfnisse haben sich eruebrigt.  Aber dass die neuen digitalen
Methoden und Technologien eine leistungsfaehige Alternative zur
Schriftkultur darstellen, kann nicht deutlich genug hervorgehoben
werden.

Als ich mit der Arbeit an diesem Buch begann, war ich davon ueberzeugt,
dass wir fuer die dem Menschen eigene Tendenz zu immer hoeherer
Effizienz--genauer: fuer unseren Drang, immer mehr fuer immer weniger
Geld zu bekommen--einen Preis bezahlen muessen: die Aufgabe der
Schriftkultur und der an sie geknuepften Werte wie Tradition, Buecher,
Kunst, Familie, Philosophie, Ethik und vieles andere.  Wir sehen uns
schnelleren Lebensrhythmen und kuerzeren Interaktionszeiten ausgesetzt.
Zahlreiche und vielfaeltige Vermittlungselemente beeinflussen unser
Verstaendnis von dem, was wir tun.  Fragmentarisierung und
gleichzeitige Vernetzung der Welt, neue Synchronisierungstechnologien
und die Dynamik von Lebensformen oder kuenstlich geschaffenen Gebilden
entziehen sich schriftkulturellem Zugriff und konstituieren einen
neuen Rahmen fuer unsere Lebenspraxis.  Besonders deutlich wird das,
wenn wir die grundlegenden Merkmale der Schriftlichkeit mit denen der
neuen Zeichensysteme vergleichen, die die Schriftlichkeit ergaenzen
oder ersetzen.  Sprache ist sequentiell, zentralistisch, linear und
entspricht dem linearen Wachstumsstadium der Menschheit.  Mit den
ebenfalls linear anwachsenden Mitteln des Lebensunterhalts und der
Produktion, die fuer das Leben und die Fortentwicklung der Menschheit
notwendig sind, hat dieses Stadium sein Potential realisiert und
erschoepft.  Das neue Stadium ist gekennzeichnet durch verteilte,
nichtsequentielle Taetigkeit und nichtlineare Beziehungen.  Es
spiegelt das exponentielle Wachstum der Menschheit (hinsichtlich der
Bevoelkerungszahlen, der Erwartungen, Beduerfnisse und Sehnsuechte) und
setzt auf andere, im wesentlichen kognitive Ressourcen.  Dieses
System weist eine andere, eine voellig neue Skala auf, die unter
anderem durch Globalitaet und hoehere Komplexitaetsebenen gekennzeichnet
ist.  Aus diesen voellig neuen Formen der Lebenspraxis erwachsen die
Alternativen, die unser Leben, unsere Arbeit und unsere sozialen
Beziehungen veraendern werden.

Die neuen Mittel sind nicht mehr so universell wie die Sprache,
eroeffnen aber aus den hier zunaechst angedeuteten Gruenden ein
exponentielles Wachstum.  Solange sich der Mensch in kleinen
Einheiten organisiert hatte (in Staemmen, kleinen
Siedlungsgemeinschaften, Staedten und Grafschaften), nahm die Sprache
eine zentrale Stellung ein.  Sie erfuellte in diesen
Organisationsformen vereinheitlichende Funktionen.  Mittlerweile
haben wir eine Entwicklungsphase erreicht, die von weltweiten
Abhaengigkeitsverhaeltnissen gekennzeichnet ist.  Daraus erwachsen
viele lokale Sprachen und Schriftlichkeiten mit nur relativer,
begrenzter Bedeutung, die aber in ihrer Gesamtheit unsere Praxis
optimieren.  Aus Buergern, Citizens, werden vernetzte Buerger, Netizens,
und diese Identitaet bindet sie nicht nur an den jeweiligen Platz
ihres Lebens und ihrer Arbeit, sondern an die ganze Welt.

Das allumfassende System der Kultur brach in viele Teilsysteme auf,
und zwar keinesfalls nur in die von C. P. Snow beschriebenen zwei
Kulturen der Naturwissenschaften und der Geisteswissenschaften.  Die
Marktmechanismen befreien sich zunehmend von den Konventionen der
Schriftkultur.  Wo immer schriftkulturelle Normen und Regelungen
diese Emanzipation verhindern wollen--etwa durch Massnahmen der
Regierung, buerokratische Vorschriften von Behoerden, durch Militaer und
Justiz--bezahlen wir dafuer mit geringerer Effizienz.  Wie sehr Europa
auch immer vereint sein wird, wenn sich die Mitgliedsstaaten nicht
von den ihre Lebensfaehigkeit beeintraechtigenden schriftkulturellen
Zwaengen befreien, werden die anstehenden Konflikte nicht bewaeltigt,
und die moeglichen Loesungen ruecken in weite Ferne.

Eine letzte Bemerkung: Die Publikationsindustrie der Wissenschaft
kann noch immer nicht begreifen, dass jemand einen Gedanken findet,
der nicht auf einem Zitat beruht.  Im Einklang mit der
Autoritaetsfixierung der Schriftkultur habe ich all jene Werke
angefuehrt, die sich in irgendeiner Weise auf den Inhalt dieses Buches
ausgewirkt haben.  Nur sehr wenige werden im Text selbst erwaehnt.
Ich habe mir erlaubt, der Entwicklung meines Gedankengangs Prioritaet
vor den stereotypen Fussnotenverweisen einzuraeumen.  Das soll mich
jedoch nicht daran hindern, neben Leibniz und Peirce den Einfluss
zahlreicher weiterer Gelehrter anzuerkennen, insbesondere von
Humberto Maturana, Terry Winograd, George Lakoff, Lotfi Zadeh, Hans
Magnus Enzensberger, George Steiner, Marshall McLuhan, Ivan Illich,
Jurij M. Lotman und sogar Jean Baudrillard, dem Essayisten des
postindustriellen Zeitalters.  Wenn ich irgend jemanden ungenau
wiedergebe, geschieht dies nicht aus Missachtung seines Werks.  In der
Verfolgung des eigenen Erkenntnisinteresses und der eigenen
Argumentation habe ich von ihren Gedanken eingebaut, was mir ein
brauchbarer Baustein in meinem Gedankengebaeude zu sein schien.  Fuer
Entwurf und Bauweise trage allein ich die Verantwortung und stelle
mich gern der Kritik.  Das mindert nicht im geringsten meinen Dank an
all jene, deren Fingerabdruecke auf manchen Bausteinen zu erkennen
sind.

In den fuenfzehn Jahren, in denen ich an diesem Buch gearbeitet habe,
sind viele der von mir diskutierten Entwicklungen fuer jeden erkennbar
eingetreten.  Aber ich bin alles andere als ungluecklich oder
ueberrascht zu sehen, dass sich die Realitaet veraendert hat, noch bevor
dieses Buch erscheinen konnte.  Als ich die Gedanken, die schliesslich
in dieses Buch eingingen, erstmals mit Studenten diskutierte, in
Vortraegen vorstellte und vor politischen, administrativen oder
wissenschaftlichen Kreisen veroeffentlichte, hatte das Internet noch
nicht die Boerse bestimmt, waren die Buecher ueber den Zukunftsschock
mit ihren schaeumenden Prophezeiungen noch nicht erschienen und hatte
noch kein Unternehmen das grosse Geld mit den Multimedien gemacht.
Das Buch sollte indes nicht nur Vorgaenge und Tendenzen beschreiben,
sondern auch ein Programm fuer praktisches Handeln entwickeln.
Deshalb widme ich mich nach den theoretischen Teilen angewandten
Fragestellungen.  (In der deutschen Fassung wurden die Teile, die dem
neuen Status der Familie, der Sexualitaet, dem Kochen und Essen sowie
der Kunst und Literatur gewidmet sind, nicht uebernommen).
Abschliessend versuche ich praktische Massnahmen vorzuschlagen, die
sich als Alternativen zu den eingetretenen Pfaden verstehen.  Ich
wuerde es in der Tat gern sehen, wenn man meine Vorschlaege pruefen und
anwenden, uebernehmen und weiterentwickeln wuerde (ob unter Wuerdigung
meiner Urheberschaft oder nicht!).  Und lieber wuerde ich eine
kritische oder ablehnende Rezeption dieses Buches in Kauf nehmen, als
die Tatsache, dass es unbemerkt bliebe.




BUCH I.



Kapitel 1:


Die Kluft zwischen Gestern und Morgen Kontrastfiguren

Heutzutage wird an einem einzigen Tag mehr Information produziert als
in den vergangenen 300 Jahren zusammen.  Die Bedeutung dieser
trockenen Zahlen aus dem Bereich der Datenverarbeitung wollen wir an
einem Beispiel verdeutlichen.

Die Friseurin Zizi und ihre Freunde vertreten den heutigen Zeitgeist
und die lesefaehige Bevoelkerung mit durchschnittlicher Schulbildung.
Hans Magnus Enzensberger vergleicht sie in seinen "Gesammelten
Zerstreuungen" mit Pascal, der seine Arbeit ueber die Kegelschnitte
als 16jaehriger veroeffentlicht hatte, mit Hugo Grotius, der im Alter
von 15 Jahren seinen Hochschulabschluss erwarb, und mit Melanchthon,
der bereits mit zwoelf Jahren an der beruehmten Heidelberger
Universitaet eingeschrieben war.  Zizi weiss, wo es langgeht.  Sie ist
wie eine leibhaftige Internetadresse: mehr Verbindungen als Inhalte,
staendig im Aufbau begriffen.  Sie beschreitet viele neue Wege, keiner
wird beendet.  OEffentliche Mittel sichern ihr Wohlergehen, sie ist im
Genuss aller Formen der Sozialhilfe, die die Gesellschaft zu bieten
hat.  Zizi parliert ueber Steuern, ueber Figuren aus Groschenheften und
Fernsehserien oder ueber Personen aus ihrem letzten Urlaub.  Ihre Rede
besteht aus Klischees aus dem Mund der allseits bewunderten
Alltagshelden.  Ihr Freund, der 34jaehrige Bruno G., hat einen
Universitaetsabschluss in politischer Wissenschaft, verdient sein Geld
als Taxifahrer und ist sich ueber seine weiteren Lebensziele voellig im
unklaren.  Er kann die deutschen Fussballmeister seit 1936 auswendig
hersagen, kennt die namentliche Aufstellung jeder Mannschaft und
jedes Spielergebnis auswendig und weiss genau, welcher Trainer wann
gefeuert wurde.  Melanchthon lernte Lesen, Schreiben, Latein,
Griechisch und Theologie.  Er kannte zahlreiche Stellen aus der Bibel
und aus den Werken antiker Schriftsteller auswendig.  Seine Welt war
klein.  Um sie zu erklaeren, brauchte man weder Mathematik noch Physik,
sondern nur Philosophie.  Da wir Melanchthon weder einer
Multiple-choice-Pruefung noch einem Intelligenztest unterziehen koennen,
wissen wir auch nicht, ob er heute eine Abitur- oder eine
universitaere Aufnahmepruefung bestehen wuerde.  Damit sind wir bei der
ebenso simplen wie entscheidenden Frage: Wer ist unwissender,
Melanchthon oder Zizi?

Enzensbergers Beispiele beziehen sich auf Deutschland, aber die von
ihm beschriebenen Phaenomene ueberschreiten Laendergrenzen.  Er
selbst--Schriftsteller, Lyriker, Verleger--ist gewiss alles andere als
ein blindwuetiger Internetanhaenger, obwohl er sich darin vermutlich
genauso gut auskennt wie seine Figuren.  Im Gegensatz zu vielen
anderen, die sich mit Schriftkultur und Bildung befassen, sieht
Enzensberger durchaus, dass die jenseits der Schriftkultur erreichte
Effizienz das Alter des Heranwachsens weit in jene Zeit hinein
ausdehnt, die im Leben vorausgegangener Generationen zu der
produktiven Phase zaehlte.  Heute geniesst nahezu jeder irgendeine Form
von weiterfuehrender Bildung--in manchen Laendern gibt es darauf einen
Rechtsanspruch.  Mehr als die Haelfte aller jungen Menschen hat eine
weiterfuehrende Schule oder eine Hochschule besucht.  Und nach dem
Examen wissen viele von ihnen noch immer nicht, was sie eigentlich
wollen.  Schlimmer noch, sie muessen erfahren, dass ihnen ihre
Kenntnisse oder das, was sie als ihre Kenntnisse bescheinigt bekommen
haben, bei dem, was von ihnen im Leben erwartet wird, nicht
sonderlich nuetzlich sind.  Wie Zizi leben sie von Sozialfuersorge und
reagieren zornig, wenn irgend jemand die Frage aufwirft, ob sich die
Gesellschaft diese Art von Unterstuetzung ueberhaupt noch leisten kann.
Der in ihrer Lebenserfahrung sich festsetzende Eindruck der
Leistungsfaehigkeit der Gesellschaft rechtfertigt in ihren Augen den
Anspruch, sich darueber, ob sie selbst je zu dieser Leistungsfaehigkeit
beitragen werden, keine Gedanken machen zu muessen.  Von ihrer
Ausbildung erwarten sie, wohl zu recht, dass alles fuer ihr spaeteres
Leben relevant ist.  Das Problem liegt allerdings darin, dass weder
sie noch ihre Lehrer genau wissen, was das heisst.  Ihnen bietet sich
eine immer groessere Auswahl an Faechern, die immer weniger
berufsrelevant sind.  Ein Buch wird kaum noch zu Ende gelesen;
Pflichtlektuere wird in kleinen Portionen vergeben, ueblicherweise in
Form von Fotokopien.  Beigefuegt ist ein Fragenkatalog in der Hoffnung,
dass die Schueler die zu seiner Beantwortung noetigen Seiten auch
wirklich lesen und nicht etwa die Antworten von ihren fleissigeren
Freunden abschreiben.

Zizi verfuegt vermutlich ueber einen Wortschatz, der im Umfang etwa dem
eines Gelehrten aus dem 16. Jahrhundert entspricht.  Dass sie davon
weniger als 1000 Woerter aktiv verwendet, besagt lediglich, dass sie
nur so viele benoetigt, um erfolgreich im Leben zu bestehen.
Melanchthon verwendete nahezu alle Woerter, die er kannte.  Seine
Arbeit erforderte eine Beherrschung der Schriftkultur, die ihm jeden
neuen Gedanken zu formulieren erlaubte, der sich aus den relativ
wenigen neuen Erfahrungen im Prozess der menschlichen
Identitaetsfindung ergab, derer er gewahr wurde.  Er beherrschte drei
Sprachen, zwei davon sind heute nur noch Gegenstand
wissenschaftlicher Beschaeftigung in entsprechenden Fachdisziplinen.
Zizi reichen fuer ihren naechsten Urlaub in Griechenland oder Italien
einige Saetze aus dem Reisefuehrer oder vom Kassettenrecorder: Reisen
gehoert zu ihrem Alltag.  Sie kennt zahllose Rockgruppen und kann alle
Lieder mitsingen, die ihre Sorgen artikulieren: Sex, Drogen,
Einsamkeit.  Ihre Erinnerung an Rockkonzerte und Filme duerfte
wesentlich umfangreicher sein als die Melanchthons, der vielleicht
die Liturgie der katholischen Kirche auswendig kannte.  Wie alle, die
ihre Identitaet jenseits der Schriftkultur finden, weiss Zizi, was sie
von den Steuern absetzen kann.  Ihr Lebensrhythmus ist mehr durch
wirtschaftliche als durch natuerliche Zyklen bestimmt.  Vor allem haelt
sie die Basis ihres praktischen Wissens stets auf dem neuesten Stand.
In einer Zeit permanenter Veraenderung ist dies ihre einzige Chance,
dem System und allen davon ausgehenden Bildungsnormen und
Einschraenkungen die Stirn zu bieten.

Melanchthon haette bei all seiner Bildung schon zwischen zwei
aufeinanderfolgenden Steuergesetzen die Orientierung verloren, ganz
zu schweigen von den rasch wechselnden Bekleidungs- und Musikmoden,
der Entwicklung der Computersoftware oder gar der Computerchips.
Sein Orientierungssystem entsprach einer stabilen Welt mit weitgehend
unveraenderlichen Erwartungen.  Die Inhalte seiner Bildung behielten
fuer den Rest seines Lebens ihre Gueltigkeit.  Zizi, Bruno und ihre
Freundin Helga--die dritte Figur bei Enzensberger--leben dagegen in
einer Welt, deren Wissensangebot heterogen und nicht festgelegt ist.
Es gruendet auf ad-hoc-Methoden, die sie in Zeitschriften finden oder
im Internet, das man nur zu durchsurfen braucht, um an nuetzliche
Informationen zu gelangen.

Wir muessen uns indes, schon um den Eindruck einer Karikierung des
Internets zu vermeiden, den pragmatischen Kontext vergegenwaertigen,
innerhalb dessen Zizi ihre Identitaet findet und in dem das Internet
als weltweiter Erfahrungsfundus fungiert.  Es ist gewiss nicht ganz
fair, Melanchthon und die Friseurin Zizi zu vergleichen.  Ebenso
unfair waere es, die Bibliothek von Alexandria mit dem Internet zu
vergleichen.  Die eine birgt eine unschaetzbare Sammlung, die das
gesamte menschliche Wissen repraesentiert (auch die Illusion von
Wissen).  Das andere bietet extrem effektive Methoden, mit denen wir
die fuer die pragmatischen Lebenszusammenhaenge benoetigten
Informationen erwerben, pruefen, benutzen und verwerfen koennen.  Die
Welt Melanchthons blieb auf Mitteleuropa und Rom beschraenkt.
Nachrichten wurden hauptsaechlich muendlich uebertragen.  Wie alle, die
mit Buechern aufwachsen und mit ihnen arbeiten, hatte Melanchthon viel
weniger Informationen zu verarbeiten als wir heute.  Fuer seine Zwecke
brauchte er weder einen Intel-inside-Computer noch eine Suchmaschine.
Er haette auch nicht verstehen koennen, wie man Bedarf und Vergnuegen
am browsen--am Durchblaettern--einer Maschine, eben dem Browser,
ueberlassen kann.  Seine geistige Welt bestand aus Assoziationen,
nicht aus Suchergebnissen, so ertragreich diese auch sein moegen.
Seine Erkenntniswelt wurde durch den menschlichen Verstand, nicht
durch Maschinen aufgebaut.

Schriftlichkeit eroeffnete einen Zugang zum Wissen, solange dieses
Wissen mit den pragmatischen Strukturen kompatibel war, die es
verkoerperte und foerderte.  Das Ozonloch der Informationsueberflutung
liess diese Schutzhuelle der Schriftlichkeit platzen.  Im neuen
pragmatischen Kontext sieht sich der datenhungrige Mensch auf Gedeih
und Verderb einer Informationsumwelt ausgeliefert, die Arbeit,
Unterhaltung und Freizeit, ja, das gesamte Leben formt.  Zu
Melanchthons ganz auf Exzellenz ausgerichteter Zeit war der Zugang
zur Bildung nur wenigen offen und entsprach nicht im entferntesten
unseren Massstaeben von Gleichheit und Fairness.  Jegliche Form von
Wissen war sehr teuer.  Um Friseurin zu werden--sofern dies vor 500
Jahren moeglich und noetig gewesen waere--haette Zizi wie Millionen
andere, die wie sie eine Berufsausbildung genossen haben, viel mehr
bezahlen muessen als in unserer heutigen Zeit mit ihrem unbeschraenkten
Zugang zur Mittelmaessigkeit.  Wissen wurde durch unterschiedliche
Instanzen vermittelt--durch Familie, Schule und Kirche--und nur durch
wenige Buecher verbreitet, oft nur muendlich oder durch Nachahmung.

Die Erwartungen, die ein Individuum zur Zeit Melanchthons hegte, und
die von ihm verfolgten Ziele veraenderten sich im Verlauf eines Lebens
nur unwesentlich, da auch der pragmatische Lebenszusammenhang
unveraendert blieb.  Das fuehrte zur dynamischen, praktischen Erfahrung
der Identitaetsfindung, die schliesslich den pragmatischen Kontext
unserer Zeit entstehen liess.  Vorbei sind auch alle Formen von
Kooperation und Solidaritaet, die, so unvollendet sie auch gewesen
sein moegen, eine Lebensform und ein Wertesystem kennzeichneten, worin
das UEberleben des Einzelnen fuer das UEberleben und das Wohlergehen der
Gemeinschaft ausschlaggebend war.  An ihre Stelle ist eine allseits
verbreitete Konkurrenzmentalitaet getreten.  Nicht selten nimmt sie
den Charakter von Feindseligkeit an, die im Fall von auf die
Schriftkultur verpflichteten, gebildeten Rechtsanwaelten sozial
akzeptiert, im Fall von jenseits dieser Kultiviertheit operierenden,
‘illiteraten’ Terroristen unerwuenscht ist.

Unser Szenario, in dem Zizi und Melanchthon die Hauptrollen spielen,
kann die Kluft zwischen gestern und heute natuerlich nur andeuten.
Eine genauere Untersuchung der heutigen Lage ergaebe jedoch, dass die
Schriftsprache nicht mehr ausschliesslich, und nicht einmal
vornehmlich, unser taegliches Leben bestimmt.  Im Alltag der
wirtschaftlich fortgeschrittenen Laender ist ein wesentlicher Teil der
sprachlichen Kommunikation durch maschinelle Transaktionen ersetzt
worden.  Digitale Netzwerke verknuepfen Produktionsstaetten,
Verteilungskanaele und Verkaufsstellen und erhoehen Umfang und Vielfalt
dieser Transaktionen.  Auch die alltagspraktischen Ablaeufe wie
Einkaufen, Transport, Banken- und Boersengeschaefte beduerfen immer
weniger der Schriftlichkeit.  Die Automatisierung hat in vielen
Taetigkeitsbereichen die schriftliche Komponente wegrationalisiert,
und weltweit machen--unabhaengig vom jeweiligen wirtschaftlichen und
technologischen Entwicklungsstand--kommunikationsspezifische
Erscheinungen wie Werbung, Politkampagnen oder vielfaeltige Formen des
Zeremoniells (religioese, militaerische, sportliche) nur allzu deutlich,
dass die Schriftsprache der Funktion und dem Zweck untergeordnet
bleibt.

Derartige Entwicklungen haben nicht nur Auswirkungen auf
schriftsprachliche Kulturen und solche, die diese
Schriftsprachlichkeit bereits hinter sich gelassen haben, sondern
auch auf Lebensgemeinschaften, die sich noch immer in einem
Vorstadium der schriftsprachlichen Kultur befinden--auf die
nomadische, animistische Bevoelkerung des Sudan, die Indianerstaemme in
den Regenwaeldern des Amazonas und auf die zurueckgezogen lebenden
Staemme in Afrika, Asien und Australien.  Wir sollten uns klarmachen,
dass die Gueter und Waren dieser Kulturen einschliesslich ihrer
Arbeitskraft, aber auch ihre Beduerfnisse und Erwartungen, auf dem
globalen Markt gehandelt werden.  Im von lese- und schreibunkundigen
Indianerstaemmen bevoelkerten Hochland Perus wird ebenso ferngesehen
wie in der Sahara--mit Fernsehgeraeten, die an Autobatterien
angeschlossen sind.  Als virtuelle Verkaufsobjekte werden die Laender
mit vorzivilisatorischen Gesellschaften auf dem Futures-Markt als
moegliche Urlaubsgebiete oder als Lieferanten fuer billige Arbeitskraft
gehandelt.  Auch bleibt ihre praktische Identitaetserfahrung im
Kontext eines nomadischen, animistischen Stammesdaseins nicht mehr
laenger auf die enge Grenze der jeweiligen Lebensgemeinschaft
beschraenkt.  In der hocheffizienten Welt globaler Lebensplanung
erscheinen ihr Hunger und ihr Elend in den Entwuerfen von potentiellen
Hilfs- und Kooperationsprogrammen.  Wir sollten dies nicht nur als
Gier und Zynismus auslegen, sondern auch als Ausdruck gegenseitiger
Abhaengigkeit.  AIDS auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent und die
Ebola-Epidemie sind nur zwei Beispiele fuer Gefahren, die die ganze
Welt betreffen.  Die Pflanzen des immer kleiner werdenden Regenwaldes
des Amazonas, deren Heilwirkung wir nutzen, koennen auch die
gemeinsamen Chancen symbolisieren.  In einem solchen Zusammenhang,
aus solchen Anlaessen und an solchen Orten treffen die pragmatischen
Lebensformen von Schriftkultur und diejenigen jenseits der
Schriftkultur zusammen und finden zu gemeinsamen Aufgaben.


Taste waehlen--druecken

Texte werden durch Bilder ersetzt; Geraeusche fuegen Rhythmus oder
Nuancierungen hinzu; nichtsprachliche, visuelle Darstellungen
dominieren; bewegte Bilder erzeugen eine Dynamik, die vom
geschriebenen Wort nur angedeutet werden koennte.  In technologisch
fortschrittlichen Gesellschaften verbinden interaktive Multimedien
(oder Hypermedien) visuelle, akustische, dynamische und strukturale
Darstellungsformen.  Kontexte fuer die persoenliche Auswertung,
Organisation und Bearbeitung von Informationen spriessen in
CD-ROM-Formaten geradezu aus dem Boden, als interaktive Spiele, als
Lehrprogramme.  High-fidelity-Stereoklang, umfangreiche
Videomoeglichkeiten, Computergraphiken und eine Vielzahl von Mitteln
zur individuellen menschlichen Interaktion bilden die technologische
Grundlage fuer eine sich herausbildende allgegenwaertige
computerisierte Umwelt.

Dieser Prozess kann vorlaeufig folgendermassen zusammengefasst werden:
Die Form von Kooperation und Interaktion, die der Komplexitaet unseres
heutigen Zeitalters gerecht wird, muss die Massstaebe hoechster Effizienz
erfuellen.  Die relativ stabile und gut strukturierte Kommunikation
auf der Basis der Schrift erweist sich heute als weniger effizient
als ein schneller und eher fragmentarischer Kontakt durch Mittel, die
nicht mehr auf Schriftlichkeit gruenden oder durch sie gefoerdert
werden.  Stereotypisierte, repetitive oder klar definierte einmalige
Aufgaben und die damit verbundene Schriftsprache sind zunehmend an
Maschinen uebertragen worden.  Einmalige Aufgaben setzen
Spezialisierungsstrategien voraus.  Je begrenzter die Aufgabe ist,
die dem einzelnen Kommunikationsteilnehmer zugewiesen wird, desto
effektiver sind die Wege zu ihrer Loesung.  Dies geschieht auf Kosten
der Formenvielfalt und des Ausmasses der direkten menschlichen
Interaktion und natuerlich auf Kosten der auf Schriftlichkeit
gruendenden Interaktion.  Entsprechend greift die menschliche Suche
nach Identitaet auf Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsmittel zurueck, die
nicht mehr nur auf Schrift gruenden oder auf sie zurueckzufuehren sind.
Die der Schriftlichkeit eigenen Merkmale beeinflussen unsere
Erkenntnisprozesse, Interaktionsformen und auch die Natur unserer
Produktionsbemuehungen in immer geringerem Ausmass.  Gleichwohl muessen
wir erkennen, dass diese Umstrukturierung unseres praktischen Handelns
weder allgemeine Zustimmung findet noch konfliktlos ist, wie wir im
folgenden darlegen wollen.

Manch einem bleibt die eingeschraenktere Rolle der Schriftlichkeit und
der allgemeine Rueckgang der Sprachlichkeit und Sprachfertigkeit im
heutigen Leben verborgen, andere wiederum ueberlassen sich der
zunehmenden Schriftlosigkeit, ohne sich dieser Tatsache ueberhaupt
bewusst zu werden.  Viele klagen heute ueber das niedrige
Bildungsniveau, stimmen aber der Einfuehrung von Methoden und der
Einrichtung von Lebensbeduerfnissen zu, die eine auf Schriftlichkeit
basierenden Bildung immer bedeutungsloser machen.  Wenn diese
Menschen sich auf Bildung berufen, gefallen sie sich in einer
Sehnsucht nach etwas, was ihr taegliches Leben laengst nicht mehr
beeinflusst.  Ihre gesamte Lebensweise, ihr Denken, Fuehlen, ihre
zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen, ihre Erwartungen bezueglich Familie,
Religion, Ethik, Moral, Kunst, Essen, Kultur und Freizeit spiegeln
laengst diese neue Lebensform der Schriftlosigkeit wider.  Und diese
Entwicklung ist zwangslaeufig, niemand hat wirklich eine Wahl.  Viele
Politiker, Lehrer und (Schrift-) Kulturschaffende (Schriftsteller,
Verleger, Buchhaendler) zeigen sich ueber den niedrigen Bildungsstand
derer besorgt, die eine Ausbildung genossen haben, welche bislang als
ausreichende Grundlage fuer durchschnittlich gebildete Erwachsene galt.
Sie befuerchten, moeglicherweise aus den falschen Gruenden, dass die
Menschen ohne ein hohes Mass an Schreibund Lesefertigkeit nicht leben
und gedeihen koennen.  Worueber sie tatsaechlich besorgt sind, ist nicht
die Tatsache, dass man heutzutage weniger gut oder korrekt schreibt,
weniger liest (sofern manche ueberhaupt noch lesen), sondern dass manch
einer trotz dieses Umstandes durchaus im Leben bestehen kann.  Die
selbsternannten Helden der Schriftkultur verwenden Kraft, Energie und
Gedanken nicht etwa auf die Frage, wie man aus diesem Umbruch Nutzen
ziehen, sondern wie man einen unvermeidlichen Prozess anhalten kann.

Dieser Umbruch trat keinesfalls ueber Nacht ein.  Norbert Wieners
vorausblickende Warnung, dass wir uns zu Sklaven intelligenter
Maschinen machen, die viele unserer geistigen Faehigkeiten uebernehmen,
verdient in diesem Zusammenhang mehr als nur beilaeufige Erwaehnung.
Andere fuehren das in den 60er Jahren weltweit zu verzeichnende
Aufbrechen der traditionellen Bildungssysteme ins Feld.  Diese
Vorgaenge und die von Wiener bezeichneten Maschinen sind ein weiteres
Symptom, wenn auch nicht der Grund, fuer den Niedergang der
Schriftkultur.  Ich vertrete im Folgenden die These, dass sich
Schriftlosigkeit, soweit sie sich bislang manifestiert hat, aus der
veraenderten praktischen Erfahrung des Menschen ergeben hat; das heisst
aus einem praktischen Handeln, welches einem neuen Zivilisationsstand
entspricht.  (Wenn ich von Pragmatik und praktischem Handeln spreche,
dann in der alten griechischen Bedeutung des Wortes: pragma ‘Taten’
aus prattein ‘machen’, ‘handeln’.) Welchem Beruf wir auch
nachgehen--als Angestellter einer grossen Firma oder als selbstaendiger
Geschaeftsmann, als Bauer, Kuenstler, Sprachlehrer, Mathematiker,
Programmierer oder auch als Mitglied des Verwaltungsrats einer
Universitaet--wir alle haben laengst, wenn auch etwas zoegerlich, die
Rationalisierung der Sprache akzeptiert.  Wir haben uns in der
unpersoenlichen Welt aus stereotypisierten Diskursformen, Anwendungen,
Passwords und aus in Textverarbeitungsprogrammen gespeicherten
Standardbriefen eingerichtet.  Hoechst effektiv ueberwindet das
Internet alle Einschraenkungen, die uns die Sprache im Zusammenhang
des praktischen Handelns auferlegt hatte--als World Wide Web, als
e-mail-Medium, als Kanal fuer Datenaustausch oder auch nur als Forum
eines globalen Gedankenaustausches.  Zunehmend ist unsere Welt
gekennzeichnet durch Effizienz und global vernetzte Taetigkeiten, die
mit einer solchen Geschwindigkeit und auf unterschiedlichsten Ebenen
vollzogen werden, wie es der Schriftlichkeit niemals moeglich war.

Gleichwohl druecken sich Abhaengigkeiten aus in unserem Verhaeltnis zur
Sprache und in unserer Sprachverwendung.  Sprache scheint ein
Schluessel zum Verstand zu sein--zumindest einer von vielen.  Dies ist
einer der Gruende, warum die kuenstliche Intelligenz so sehr an Sprache
interessiert ist.  Darueber hinaus ist sie offenkundig ein
wesentliches soziales Merkmal.  Also kommt es auch nicht ueberraschend,
dass sich aus dem veraenderten Status der Sprache weitere
Veraenderungen ergeben, die weit ueber das hinausgehen, was wir in
einem naiven Sprachverstaendnis fuer die Natur eines Wortes, die
Leistung eines Wortes oder einer Grammatikregel oder fuer einen Text
halten.  Ein Wort auf einem bedruckten Blatt Papier wie dem
vorliegenden ist etwas ganz anderes als ein Wort im Hypertext einer
multimedialen Anwendung oder im Web.  Die Buchstaben erfuellen jeweils
unterschiedliche Aufgaben.  Fehlt einer auf dieser Seite, liegt ein
Druckfehler vor.  Beruehrt man einen, geschieht gar nichts.  Wenn wir
aber einen Buchstaben auf einer Webpage anklicken, werden wir
unverzueglich mit anderen Zeichen, Bildern, Geraeuschen und
interaktiven, multimedialen Darstellungen verbunden.  Solche
Veraenderungen sind Thema des vorliegenden Buches.  Sie helfen uns zu
verstehen, warum Schriftlosigkeit sich nicht zufaellig ergeben,
sondern zwangslaeufig entwickelt hat.


Das Leben ist schneller geworden

Die heutige Welt ist durch Effizienz gekennzeichnet.  Und obwohl dies
zumindest auf den Computer-Bildschirmen, den Bedienungsknoepfen und
Sensoren jener Maschinen offenkundig wird, von denen wir zunehmend
abhaengen, bemaechtigen sich die Effizienzerwartungen des Geschaefts-
und Finanzlebens zunehmend auch unserer Privatsphaere.  Unsere
Effizienzerwartungen haben auch unsere Haeuslichkeit nachhaltig
veraendert--Kueche, Arbeits- oder Badezimmer--und die entsprechenden
sozialen und familiaeren Rollen neu definiert.  Das, was uns frueher
andere abgenommen haben, erledigen wir heute fast ausschliesslich
selbst.  Wir kochen (sofern wir das Aufwaermen von Fertiggerichten in
der Mikrowelle noch kochen nennen duerfen), wir waschen unsere Waesche
(sofern wir das Sortieren unserer Schmutzwaesche nach Waschprogrammen
und das Fuellen der Waschmaschine waschen nennen duerfen), wir
schreiben und drucken unsere Texte selber aus, wir fahren uns selbst
und unsere Kinder.  Der Mensch ist durch die Maschine ersetzt worden,
wir haben uns zu ihrem Sklaven gemacht.  Wir muessen die Sprache ihrer
Bedienungsanleitungen lesen und die Konsequenzen aus ihrer Benutzung
tragen: erhoehten Energieverbrauch, Umweltverschmutzung und erhoehte
Muellmengen, vor allem aber Abhaengigkeit.  Unsere Beziehungen werden
fluechtiger; "Wie geht es?" gibt nicht mehr unser aufrichtiges
Interesse wieder und fordert vor allem keine wirkliche Antwort ein,
sondern ist eine leere Begruessungsformel.  Was einst tatsaechlich etwas
bedeutet und ein Gespraech eingeleitet hat, ist heute eher dazu
geeignet, zwischenmenschliche Begegnungen zu beenden oder doch im
besten Falle ein Gespraech zu eroeffnen, das nichts mit dieser
einleitenden Frage zu tun hat.  Solange das Modell der Sprachlichkeit
und der Sprachkultur seine Gueltigkeit besass, lebten wir in einem
homogenen Sprachraum, heute sehen wir uns einer fragmentarisierten
Wirklichkeit gegenueber, die aus Spezialsprachen und Registern,
Bildern, Geraeuschen, Koerpersprache und neuen Konventionen besteht.

Trotz des enormen finanziellen Aufwandes, den die Gesellschaft
jahrhundertelang in Schriftsprachlichkeit und Bildung investiert hat,
gelten diese heute nicht mehr als allseits erstrebenswertes
Bildungsziel.  Man hat sich offenbar sogar damit abgefunden, dass
nicht einmal mehr die in der ueblichen Schulausbildung vermittelte
Schriftlichkeit benoetigt wird.  Fuer einige wenige ist Schriftlichkeit
noch eine Kunst, mit der sie ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen
koennen--Redenschreiber, Texter und Verleger, vielleicht auch noch
Romanschriftsteller und Lehrer.  Sie kennen die Regeln des korrekten
Sprachgebrauchs und wenden sie an.  Die Methoden, mit denen man die
Wirksamkeit einer Botschaft aus dem Munde von Politikern,
Fernsehschauspielern, Geschaeftsleuten, Aktivisten und manch einem
anderen erhoeht, der seinerseits einen Schreibkundigen (und manchmal
sogar einen Denkkundigen) benoetigt, gehoeren zu ihrem Geschaeft.
Wieder anderen ermoeglichen diese Regeln, den Reichtum von Literatur
und Dichtung, Geschichte und Philosophie zu erforschen.  Fuer die
grosse Mehrheit hingegen ist Schriftlichkeit lediglich eine Fertigkeit
unter vielen, die man zwar auf weiterfuehrenden Schulen und
Hochschulen erwerben kann, die aber laengst nicht mehr als notwendiger
Bestandteil des gegenwaertigen und, wichtiger noch, zukuenftigen Lebens
angesehen wird.  Die Mehrheit, vielleicht 75% der Gesamtbevoelkerung,
geht davon aus, dass alles lebensnotwendige Wissen gespeichert und
allgemein zugaenglich ist--Mathematik in den Kaufhauskassen oder im
Taschenrechner, Chemie im Waschpulver, Physik im Toaster, Sprache auf
den Glueckwunschkarten fuer alle denkbaren Gelegenheiten, bzw. als
Rechtschreibprogramm oder Formulierungshilfe in den
Textverarbeitungsprogrammen.

Vier Gruppen zeichnen sich ab: diejenigen, fuer die Schriftlichkeit
eine Kunst ist; diejenigen, die sich mit den auf Schriftlichkeit
gruendenden Werten naeher beschaeftigen; diejenigen, deren Leben in
einer Welt vorgefertigter Sprachwerke ablaeuft; und diejenigen, die
jenseits der Begrenzungen der Schriftlichkeit taetig sind, die
Erkenntnisgrenzen ausdehnen, neue Mittel und Methoden der
Kommunikation und Interaktion entwickeln und ihre Identitaet in einem
praktischen Handeln finden, das durch hoehere Effizienz gekennzeichnet
ist.  Diese vier Gruppen haben sich aus den Veraenderungen der
Lebensbedingungen in der allgemein (wohl etwas zu allgemein) als
postindustriell bezeichneten Gesellschaft ergeben.  Der fuer unsere
Zeit des fundamentalen Umbruchs typische Konflikt vollzieht sich im
Bereich der Schriftkultur; genauer: in der Veraenderung, die auf ein
Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur hinauslaeuft.

Es ist auf den ersten Blick schwer zu sagen, ob die Sprache als
Instrument von Kontinuitaet und Dauerhaftigkeit deshalb versagt, weil
der Rhythmus unseres Daseins sich seit der Industriellen Revolution
staendig beschleunigt hat, oder ob der Rhythmus unseres Daseins sich
beschleunigt hat, weil menschliche Interaktion nicht mehr von Sprache
abhaengig war.  Es ist also nicht genau zu sagen, ob die
Beschleunigung des Lebensrhythmus auf Veraenderungen der Sprache und
Sprachbenutzung zurueckzufuehren ist, oder ob die Veraenderungen der
Sprache diese Beschleunigung einfach nur widerspiegeln.  Offenkundig
ist, dass Bilder, vor allem diejenigen der interaktiven Multimedien,
und der vernetzte Austausch umfangreicher Datenkorpora einer
schnellebigen Gesellschaft angemessener sind als Texte, deren Lektuere
mehr Zeit und Konzentration erfordert.  Weniger offenkundig ist, ob
wir Sprachen und synaesthetische Ausdrucksmittel verwenden, weil wir
schneller und damit effizienter sein wollen, oder ob wir schneller
und effizienter sein koennen, wenn wir solche Mittel verwenden.  Die
kuerzeren Zeitraeume der menschlichen Interaktion und z. B. der
veraenderte Status der Familie haengen zusammen: ebenso wie die neue
politische Rolle des Individuums in der modernen Gesellschaft mit
diesen Merkmalen der Interaktion zusammenhaengt.  Aber auch hier
wissen wir nicht genau, ob die neue soziooekonomische Dynamik das
Ergebnis unseres bewussten Wunsches nach beschleunigter Interaktion
ist oder ob die beschleunigte Interaktion nur den Hintergrund (oder
den Nebeneffekt) einer umfassenderen Veraenderung unserer
Lebensbedingungen darstellt.  Ich glaube, dass eine dramatische
Veraenderung in der Skala der Menschheit und in der Beziehung zwischen
den Menschen und ihrer natuerlichen und kulturellen Umwelt diese neue
soziooekonomische Dynamik erklaeren kann.


Aufgeladene Schriftkultur

Sprachen sind wie alle anderen Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsformen
nur bedeutungsvoll in dem Mass, in dem sie Teil unseres Daseins sind.
Wenn man nicht weiss, wie die Woerter geschrieben werden, die sich auf
unser Dasein beziehen, nehmen wir an, dass beim Schreibenlernen irgend
etwas nicht mehr richtig funktioniert, normalerweise der Schueler.
Natuerlich ist Schriftlichkeit mehr als Rechtschreibung.  Also sucht
man nach Gruenden: die Schule, die Familie, neue Lebensgewohnheiten
wie ausgiebiger Fernsehgenuss, die Lektuere von Comics, die manische
Besessenheit bei Computerspielen, das Surfen im Internet, um nur
einige der offenkundigen Schuldzuweisungen zu nennen.  Unsere Kultur,
Vorurteile oder auch die Furcht vor dem Unbekannten lassen uns vor
der Frage, ob Rechtschreibung wirklich noch notwendig ist,
zurueckschrecken.  Und eine geradezu feige Konformitaet haelt uns davon
ab, die moeglichen Defekte einer Sprache oder schriftsprachlicher
Erwartungen zu hinterfragen, die wir hinter allen bekannten
politischen Programmen festmachen koennen, die uns vor jeder Wahl ins
Gesicht geschleudert werden.  Wo Schreibweise und Aussprache z. B.
so wenig zueinander im Einklang stehen wie etwa im Englischen, hat
das dazu gefuehrt, dass das Alphabet ueberprueft und alternative
Alphabete bzw. alternative Kunstsprachen entwickelt wurden.  Aber
auch in Sprachen, die konsequentere Beziehungen zwischen Aussprache
und Schriftsprache aufweisen, ist Rechtschreibung heute ein Problem.

Unsere ererbte Ehrfurcht vor der Sprache laesst aus stillschweigenden
Vermutungen ueber und aus Erwartungen an die Leistung der
Schriftkultur unveraenderliche Wahrheiten werden.  So setzen wir z. B.
als selbstverstaendlich voraus, dass eine gute Sprachbeherrschung die
Erkenntnisfaehigkeit foerdert, obwohl wir wissen, dass kognitive Ablaeufe
nicht direkt auf Sprachlichkeit zurueckzufuehren sind.  Auch geht man
allgemein davon aus, dass gebildete Menschen eines jeden Landes besser
miteinander kommunizieren und fremde Sprachen leichter erlernen
koennen.  Das ist keineswegs immer der Fall.  In Wahrheit sind
Sprachen aufgeladene Systeme von Konventionen, in denen in
erheblichem Masse nationale Vorlieben und Vorurteile aufgehoben sind
und durch Sprache, Schrift und Lektuere verbreitet werden.  Solche an
die Sprache herangetragenen Erwartungen fuehren zu wohlwollenden,
wiewohl strittigen Feststellungen der Art "Man kann eine Sprache nur
dann verstehen, wenn man wenigstens zwei versteht" (John Searle).

Des weiteren wird vorausgesetzt, dass schriftsprachlich gebildete
Menschen leichter einen Zugang zu den Kuensten und Wissenschaften
finden.  Der Grund dafuer liegt darin, dass die Sprache als
universelles Kommunikationsmittel folgerichtig das einzige Mittel ist,
das wissenschaftliche Theorien erklaert.  Ebenso liessen sich
Kunstwerke, so eine weitere These, auf sprachliche Beschreibung
reduzieren oder koennten doch besser verstanden werden mittels der
Sprache, die sie durch Bezeichnungen, Klassifizierungen und
Kategorien in den Kulturbestand einlagert.  Und schliesslich gilt
allenthalben die Annahme (und das Vorurteil), dass das Niveau der
sprachlichen und aussersprachlichen Leistungsfaehigkeit in direktem
Verhaeltnis zu der in der Schriftkultur erreichten Kompetenz steht.
Dieses Vorurteil wollen wir neben vielen anderen einer genaueren
Pruefung unterziehen; denn es zeigt sich, dass bei allem Niedergang der
Schriftkultur diejenige Sprachverwendung, die von der normierten
Schriftlichkeit abweicht, erstaunliche Formen annimmt.


Der Mensch entwirft, der Mensch verwirft.

Um die Verlagerung von einer schriftsprachlich begruendeten Kultur zu
einer Kultur, die auf vielfaeltige Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsformen
zurueckgreift, besser verstehen zu koennen, muessen wir uns das
Verhaeltnis zwischen Sprachen--scheinbar Einheiten mit einem
Eigenleben--und den Menschen, die diese konstituieren--und zwar mit
scheinbar unbegrenzter Kontrolle ueber ihre Sprache--etwas genauer vor
Augen fuehren.  Wir koennten die vielfaeltigen Ausdrucks- und
Kommunikationsmittel Sprachen nennen, wenn es eine angemessene
Definition solcher Sprachen (und den dazugehoerigen
Schriftlichkeitsformen) gaebe.  Wir haben gesagt, dass der praktische
Handlungsrahmen unseres Daseins den allgemeinen Zusammenhang
darstellt, innerhalb dessen sich der Status der Schriftkultur
veraendert hat.  Das heisst nicht nur, dass die Sprachverwendung
quantitativ oder qualitativ abnimmt.  Das heisst auch, dass wir eine
sehr komplexe Wirklichkeit anerkennen, innerhalb derer ein biologisch
und kulturell modifiziertes menschliches Wesen die Wahl zwischen
Entscheidungsmoeglichkeiten hat, welche nur schwer, wenn ueberhaupt,
miteinander in Einklang zu bringen sind.  Das Leben ist nicht deshalb
schneller geworden, weil sich unser biologischer Rhythmus abrupt
veraendert hat, sondern weil neue Rahmenbedingungen fuer unser
praktisches Handeln, eine erhoehte Effizienz, moeglich wurden.

Der Interaktionsradius geht heute weit ueber den unmittelbaren Kreis
unserer Bekannten und der Familie hinaus.  Gleichzeitig ist die
Interaktion jedoch oberflaechlicher geworden und in staerkerem Masse
durch andere vermittelt.  Unser Dasein scheint sich in einem
Universum entfalten zu koennen, das so weit ist wie der Raum, den wir
erforschen koennen.  Gleichzeitig aber nimmt der Druck der uns
unmittelbar umgebenden Wirklichkeit zu, der Druck einer zunehmend
spezialisierten Arbeit, durch deren Ergebnisse sich individuelle und
soziale Identifikation und Wertung vollzieht.  Und auf einer anderen
Ebene hat sich fuer den Einzelnen die hergebrachte Vermessung seines
sozialen Lebensraumes (Familie, Freunde, Gemeinschaft) drastisch
veraendert.  Im globalen Zusammenhang erweitert sich der zu
vermessende gesellschaftliche Lebensraum auf die unbegrenzte Zahl
derer, die an ihm teilhaben.

Charakteristisch fuer den Zusammenhang, in dem sich Status und
Funktion von Schriftlichkeit (vor allem der Kommunikation) veraendern,
ist die Fragmentierung von allem, was wir in Angriff nehmen, und die
daraus resultierende Notwendigkeit zur Koordination.  Die Vielfalt
der auf uns einstroemenden Reize hat sich vermehrt, und die gelaeufigen
Erklaerungen ihres Ursprungs und ihrer moeglichen Bedeutung erweisen
sich als nicht mehr zufriedenstellend.  Ein weiteres Merkmal fuer die
Dynamik der Veraenderung ist die Dezentralisierung von nahezu allen
Aspekten unseres Daseins, die von starken integrativen Kraeften
begleitet wird.  Die Gesellschaft wird nicht nur, wie manche glauben,
durch Kommunikation geformt.  Die sozialen Beziehungen werden von
umfassenderen Wirkkraeften bestimmt, die von Woertern, Bildern,
Geraeuschen, Texturen und Geruechen relativ unabhaengig sind und
bestaendig aus jeder Richtung und zu jedem denkbaren Zweck auf die
Mitglieder der Gesellschaft einwirken.  Auch die Ziele und Mittel der
Kommunikation werden von ihnen bestimmt.  Symptomatisch fuer die
widerspruechliche Situation des zeitgenoessischen Menschen ist die
Kluft zwischen der Leistungsstaerke der Kommunikationstechnologie und
der tatsaechlichen Effektivitaet der Kommunikation.  Oft sieht es so
aus, als haetten Botschaften ein Eigenleben und als wuerde die
Kommunikation in dem Masse, in dem sie zunimmt, ihre Adressaten
verfehlen.  Weniger als 2% aller Informationen, die in die
Kommunikationsmittel der Massenmedien eingegeben werden, erreichen
ihr Publikum.  Bei diesem Effizienzgrad wuerde kein Auto starten und
kein Flugzeug abheben!  Die Bindung der Kommunikation an die
Schriftlichkeit war ihre Staerke.  Sie garantiert ein potentielles
Publikum.  Sie erwies sich jedoch zugleich als ihre Schwaeche.  Die
Annahme naemlich, dass zwischen gebildeten Menschen Kommunikation nicht
nur stattfindet, sondern dass sie immer erfolgreich ist, erwies sich
wiederholt als falsch.  Kriege, Konflikte zwischen Nationen,
Gemeinschaften und Berufsgruppen (der akademische Bereich als eine
besonders hochgebildete soziale Gruppe stellt hier keinen
Ausnahmefall dar, ganz im Gegenteil), Familien und Generationen
erinnern uns nachdruecklich daran.  Und dennoch interpretieren wir
diesen Umstand falsch.  Ein Beispiel hierfuer ist die Sorge der
Geschaeftswelt ueber die mangelnden Kommunikationsfertigkeiten ihrer
juengeren Angestellten.  Es bleibt offenbar unbemerkt, dass bei der
massiven Umgestaltung der Unternehmen der Geschaeftsbereich
wegrationalisiert wird, der am staerksten auf Schriftkultur und
schriftkultureller Bildung beruht.

Gern wuerden wir glauben, dass die Geschaeftswelt um die grundlegenden
Werte besorgt ist, wenn ihre Vertreter auf die Schwierigkeiten
hinweisen, mit denen das mittlere Management die Geschaeftsziele und
die damit verbundenen Strategien in Wort und Schrift zu artikulieren
hat.  Die in der heutigen Wirtschaft erkennbaren Strukturen beweisen,
dass Geschaeftsleute ebenso wie Politiker und manch ein anderer, der
sich oeffentlich ueber den gegenwaertigen Stand der Bildung Gedanken
macht, mit doppelter Zunge reden.  Sie haetten gern beides: mehr
Effizienz, die Bildung und Schriftkultur weder erfordert noch fordert,
da diese den neuen soziooekonomischen Zusammenhaengen nicht angemessen
ist, und die Vorteile von Bildung und Schriftkultur, ohne allerdings
dafuer bezahlen zu muessen.  In Wirklichkeit haben sie alle nur
Wirtschaftszyklen, Produktivitaet, Effizienz und Profit im Kopf, wenn
sie sich ueber den Bedarf einer globalen Wirtschaft Gedanken machen.
Diese Umgestaltung, von vielen Unternehmen auch Umstrukturierung oder
Verschlankung genannt, fuehrt zu Effizienzerwartungen innerhalb einer
extrem kompetitiven globalen Wirtschaft.  Auf jeden Fall hat diese
Umstrukturierung den Wasserkopf an Schriftlichkeit im Geschaeftsleben
getilgt.  Die auf Bildung und Schriftkultur basierenden praktischen
Ablaeufe von Management und Produktion sind durch automatisierte
Verfahren der Datenverarbeitung und der computerunterstuetzten
Produktion ersetzt worden.  Und dieser Prozess ist keineswegs beendet.
Er hat gerade die ansonsten eher gelassene Arbeitswelt Japans
erreicht, und er koennte in Europa die Bemuehungen um eine verbesserte
Konkurrenzfaehigkeit unterstuetzen trotz aller hier gueltigen
Sozialvertraege, die aus einer Vergangenheit stammen, welche niemals
wiederkehren wird.  Das alles veraendert den Status der Sprache: Auch
sie wird zu einem Wirtschaftsinstrument, einem Produktionsmittel,
einer Technologie.  Die Losloesung der Sprache von der
Verschriftlichung und der sich daraus ergebende Qualitaetsverlust ist
nur ein Teil des allgemeinen Entwicklungsprozesses.  Aber diejenigen,
die sich diesem Prozess widersetzen, sollten sich vergegenwaertigen,
dass die Schriftkultur alles andere als perfekt war.

Die Pragmatik der Schriftkultur bildete einen Bezugsrahmen fuer
Besitzverhaeltnisse, Handel, nationale Identitaet und politische Macht.
Nun ist zwar Besitzverteilung kein voellig neues Phaenomen, aber die
Gruende und Modalitaeten beruhen heute nicht mehr nur auf Vererbung,
sondern eher auf Kreativitaet und einer sehr selbstsuechtigen Auslegung
von geschaeftlicher Loyalitaet.  Man moege bloss nicht glauben, dass die
vielen MicrosoftProgrammierer ihre Chancen, dem Club ihrer
Millionaerskollegen beizutreten, verstreichen lassen.  Aber was sie
tun, tun sie nicht fuer den Besitzer einer Firma, nicht fuer einen
legendaeren und umstrittenen Unternehmer, und gewiss nicht aus
Idealismus.  Die vielen jungen und weniger jungen Leute, die ihre
Chance in diesem relativ hierarchiefreien Umfeld nutzen, tun dies
ausschliesslich fuer sich selbst.  Sie werden vorangetrieben vom
Konkurrenzstreben, nicht von dem Glauben an die Nation, an eine
politische Ideologie oder von Familienstolz.  Solche und andere
Strukturaspekte, die sich aus der Losloesung von den strukturalen
Merkmalen eines durch Schriftlichkeit definierten
Handlungszusammenhangs ergeben, machen die Gesellschaft nicht
automatisch besser oder gerechter.  Dennoch verzeichnen wir eine
Umverteilung von Reichtum und Macht, und eine Neudefinition jener
Ziele und Methoden, innerhalb derer wir unsere Demokratie ausueben.

Wir wissen auch, dass wir denen, die wir Minoritaeten nennen, unsere
Schriftkultur aufgezwungen haben.  Da aber das Schreiben weniger
natuerlich als das Sprechen ist und vor allem kulturspezifische Werte
vermittelt, hat es die Individualitaet verfremdet.  Schriftlichkeit
bedeutet fuer viele Minderheiten eine Form der Integration, die ihre
Taetigkeit und ihre Kultur kurzerhand vereinnahmt und deren
kulturelles Erbe durch die herrschende Schriftlichkeit ersetzt.
"Wenn die Schrift auch vielleicht nicht ausreichte, um das Wissen zu
verfestigen," bemerkte Claude Levi-Strauss, "dann war sie
moeglicherweise zumindest noetig, um Herrschaft zu verfestigen."  Der
Kampf gegen Unbildung und Schriftlosigkeit ist daher gleichbedeutend
mit der Verstaerkung der Kontrolle, die die Autoritaet ueber den Buerger
ausuebt.  Ich will nicht behaupten, die gegenwaertigen Versuche,
Multiplizitaet zu wuerdigen und die unueberbrueckbaren Unterschiede
zwischen Rassen, Kulturen und praktischen Erfahrungen anzuerkennen,
seien nicht auch das Ergebnis der traditionellen Bildung und
Schriftkultur.  Dennoch besteht fuer mich kein Zweifel, dass bestimmte
Entwicklungen jenseits der Schriftkultur das Phaenomen der
Multiplizitaet in den Vordergrund gerueckt haben: Denn erst dieses neue
Stadium liefert den Hintergrund fuer heterogene menschliche
Erfahrungen und konfligierende Wertsysteme und gruendet auf dem
Potential, das in dieser Multiplizitaet liegt.


Jenseits der Schriftkultur

Unser Gegenstand mit seinen vielfaeltigen Implikationen verdient eine
genauere Untersuchung ausserhalb, aber nicht ungeachtet der
politischen Kontroverse, die er bereits hervorgerufen hat.  Schreiben
verkoerpert eingegangene Verpflichtungen, die von den Handelsabkommen
der Phoenizier ueber die historischen Aufzeichnungen der AEgypter,
religioese und Gesetzestexte in Ton und Stein, die mittelalterlichen
Eidformeln bis zu den spaeteren Vertraegen reichen.  Die geschriebene
Sprache spiegelt auf vielen Ebenen (dem Alphabet, der Satzstruktur,
ihrer Semantik usw.) die Natur der Beziehungen zwischen denen, an die
sie sich richtet, wider.  Eine Worttafel der AEgypter zur
Identifikation von Handelsguetern richtete sich an nur wenige Leser.
Ein begrenzter Bereich des Daseins, aus Arbeit und Handel, wurde in
direkter Notierung wiedergegeben.  Im gegebenen Kontext ermoeglichten
diese Tafeln die erwartete Effizienz.  Im Rahmen des Roemischen
Imperiums erforderte die Bezeichnung von Baumaterialien--Dachziegel,
Entwaesserungsrohre, die innerhalb und ausserhalb des Imperiums
vertrieben wurden--differenziertere Notationselemente.  Die
Materialien erhielten im Verlauf der Produktion Stempelpraegungen und
ermoeglichten es den Verwendern, nach ihrem Bedarf auszuwaehlen.  Die
Adressaten wurden zahlreicher, ihr Hintergrund vielfaeltiger:
Verschiedene Sprachen und verschiedene kulturelle Zusammenhaenge waren
im Spiel.  Die praktischen Erfahrungen der Baumeister waren komplexer
als die der aegyptischen Getreidehaendler mit ihrem vergleichsweise
kleinen Aktionsradius.  Die Bezeichnung des Baumaterials entsprach
dem Beduerfnis und den Erwartungen der historischen Situation.  Im
Verlauf der Zeit wurden solche Bezeichnungsmassnahmen immer
vollkommener und loesten sich allmaehlich vom unmittelbaren Gegenstand.
Mit dem Entstehen der Schrift entwickelten sie sich zu
formalisierten Vertraegen und deckten unterschiedliche pragmatische
Kontexte ab.  Sie alle tragen die Kennzeichen der Schriftlichkeit.
Sie repraesentieren zugleich den Konflikt zwischen schriftkulturellen
Moeglichkeiten und solchen Mitteln, die den Effizienzerwartungen
jenseits der Schriftkultur angemessener sind.

Ein Blick auf heutige Vertraege verraet bereits, dass sie in einer
eigenen Sprache abgefasst sind, die selbst fuer eine durchschnittlich
gebildete Person schwer zu verstehen ist.  In ihnen werden
wirtschaftliche Erwartungen, rechtliche Bedingungen und steuerliche
Folgen quantifiziert.  In englischer Sprache sind sie nach
allgemeiner Auffassung auf der gesamten Welt verstaendlich.  In der
Europaeischen Union erwartet jedes Mitgliedsland, dass ein Vertrag
zusaetzlich in seiner eigenen Sprache abgefasst ist.  Verzoegerungen und
zusaetzliche Kosten koennen manch ein Geschaeft bedeutungslos machen.
Tatsaechlich koennte der Vertrag, nicht nur die Verpackung, in der
universellen Sprache einer maschinenlesbaren Strichkodierung abgefasst
werden.  Unser heutiger pragmatischer Rahmen der Schriftlosigkeit
bietet eine Palette von Sprachen an, die bestimmten Funktionen
entsprechen und den sich rasch veraendernden Umstaenden angemessen sind.
In einer Welt, die durch starke Konkurrenz, schnellen Austausch und
rasch wechselnde Erwartungen gekennzeichnet ist, muessen Vertrag und
Ausfuehrungsmechanismen effizient sein.

Die spezifischen Verhaeltnisse zur Macht, zum Besitz und zur
nationalen Identitaet, die in der Sprache zum Ausdruck gebracht und
durch die Mittel der Schriftlichkeit stabilisiert werden, sind in
Mythen, Religionen, in Dichtung und Literatur festgeschrieben.  Von
den Epen der aelteren Kulturen ueber die Balladen der Troubadoure und
dem Minnesang bis zur Dichtung und Literatur der Neuzeit finden wir
Besitz, Gefuehle, auf Leben und Tod thematisiert.  Die Ereignisse des
Lebens wurden aufgezeichnet, Verpflichtungen und Bindungen immer
wieder bestaetigt.  Heute fuerchten viele Literati, dass diese
Manifestationen durch eine leblose Lyrik oder Prosa aus dem Computer
ersetzt werden koennten.  Zweifellos hat die Speicherung von und der
Zugang zu Informationen das Ausmass unserer Verpflichtungen und das
Ausmass historischer Aufzeichnungen, ja sogar das Gedaechtnis neu
definiert.

Wie auch immer wir zum Problem der Sprache und der Schriftlichkeit
stehen, entscheidend sind letztlich die Menschen, die sich in der
Praxis ihrer Selbstkonstituierung artikulieren.  Das Verhaeltnis der
Menschen zur Sprache drueckt ihre allgemeine Situation aus; und wenn
wir verstehen, wie und warum sich dieses Verhaeltnis veraendert, dann
verstehen wir, wie und warum sich Menschen aendern.  Mit dem Ideal der
Schriftlichkeit haben wir zugleich die Illusion uebernommen, dass ein
Verstaendnis des Menschen auch zu einem Verstaendnis der menschlichen
Sprache fuehrt.  Tatsaechlich ist es aber genau
umgekehrt--vorausgesetzt wir verstehen Sprache als eine dynamische,
praktische Erfahrung eigenen Rechts.  In diesem Zusammenhang muessen
wir uns noch einer anderen Ebene zuwenden--der menschlichen Taetigkeit
naemlich, durch die der Mensch sein Sein in die tatsaechliche
Wirklichkeit projiziert, es sinnvoll und fuer andere verstehbar macht.
Das, was wir sind, werden wir dadurch, dass wir uns durch unsere
Arbeit, durch unser Denken, durch unsere Freude und durch unsere
Neugier ausdruecken.  Unter den pragmatischen Umstaenden, die fuer die
historische Entwicklung der Menschheit bis heute charakteristisch
waren, war die Sprache hierfuer eine notwendige Voraussetzung, woraus
sich wiederum die Notwendigkeit der Schriftlichkeit ergab.  So
erweist sich Schriftlichkeit als eine Form der Verpflichtung, eine
von vielen aufeinander folgenden Verpflichtungen, die das Individuum
eingeht und auf die die Menschheit als Ganzes sich einlaesst.  Vor mehr
als 2500 Jahren schien es, als seien diese Umstaende ewig; sie
bestimmten unsere Existenz.  In dem Masse aber, in dem die Menschheit
aus dem praktischen Lebenszusammenhang herauswaechst, der auf der
zugrundeliegenden Struktur der Schriftlichkeit gruendet, werden Mittel
erforderlich, die sich von der Sprache unterscheiden.


Ein bewegliches Ziel

Zum Thema der Veraenderung gehoert auch die mit ihm verbundene
Terminologie.  Die an die Begriffe Schriftkultur / Bildung und
Schriftlosigkeit / Unbildung gebundenen Bedeutungen und
Bedeutungsveraenderungen kennzeichnen die verschiedenen Perspektiven,
aus denen sie jeweils betrachtet wurden.  Schriftlichkeit, bzw.
literacy, wie es im angelsaechsischen Bereich genannt wird, ist schon
immer ein bewegliches Ziel gewesen.  Die verschiedenen Bedeutungen
dieses Wortes spiegeln die sich aendernden Kriterien fuer die
Wertschaetzung des Schreibens und der Schreibfaehigkeit in den
verschiedenen pragmatischen Handlungsrahmen des Menschen wider.  Die
Schrift ist vermutlich ueber 5000 Jahre alt.  Die Herausbildung des
Schreibens und Lesens war die Voraussetzung fuer Bildung und
Schriftkultur; doch von einer allgemeinen Schriftlichkeit, bzw.
Alphabetisierung kann wohl erst seit der Erfindung der beweglichen
Druckschriften gesprochen werden (waehrend des 11. Jahrhunderts in
China, zu Beginn des 16. Jahrhunderts in Europa), bzw. seit der
Erfindung der Rotationsdruckmaschine im 19. Jahrhundert.

Im Verlauf der Zeit haben sich sehr unterschiedliche Auffassungen von
Bildung und Schriftkultur ergeben.  Fuer diejenigen, die die Welt
durch die Autoritaet eines einzigen Buches betrachten (Thora, Bibel,
Koran, Upanischaden, Wu Ching), bedeutet Bildung die Faehigkeit, das
Buch, und damit die Welt, zu lesen und zu verstehen.  Die in diesem
Buch formulierten Verhaltensregeln schufen den Rahmen, der entweder
in Form von Schriftlichkeit oder durch die muendliche Tradition
zugaenglich gemacht wurde.  Im Mittelalter war Bildung gleichbedeutend
mit der Kenntnis der lateinischen Sprache, die als Sprache der
goettlichen Offenbarung angesehen wurde.  Aber zu den religioesen bzw.
religioes orientierten Auffassungen von Bildung kamen andere hinzu:
die soziale--Schreiben und Lesen als Rahmen fuer soziale Interaktion;
die wirtschaftliche--Lesen, Schreiben und andere Fertigkeiten zur
Entzifferung von Landkarten, Tabellen und Symbolen, die die Teilhabe
am oekonomischen Leben ermoeglichen; die paedagogische--die Verbreitung
von Bildung; die juristische--die schriftliche Festlegung von
Gesetzen und Normen zur Regelung des gesellschaftlichen
Zusammenlebens.  Die Wissenschaft hat sich den Fragen der
Schriftkultur unter allen diesen Perspektiven gewidmet.  Dies
wiederum hat so viele Interpretationen und Theorien hervorgebracht,
dass mehr Verwirrung als Ordnung herrscht.  Dabei verdient eine
Bemerkung von Will Rogers--"Wir sind alle ungebildet, nur in
unterschiedlichen Gebieten"--unsere besondere Aufmerksamkeit, weil
sie auf ein weiteres Merkmal hinweist, das uns die relative Unbildung
unserer heutigen Zeit zu verstehen hilft.  Das Mass an Unbildung ist
nur schwer quantifizierbar, wiewohl das Ergebnis leicht erkennbar ist.
Alles, was zur Selbstsetzung des Individuums fuehrt--als Krieger,
Liebhaber, Sportler, Familienmitglied, Lehrer oder Schueler--, ist
allmaehlich aus einem auf Schriftkultur basierenden
Handlungszusammenhang herausgeloest und durch Mittel der
Schriftlosigkeit ersetzt worden.  Sex Champions, Innovatoren in den
neuen Technologien oder Olympiasieger sind in ihren jeweiligen
Bereichen ausserordentlich leistungsstark.  Spitzenleistung nimmt
heute in dem Masse zu, in dem der Durchschnittliche auf das Mittelmass
oder unterhalb des Mittelmasses zurueckfaellt.  Ich werde im Folgenden
viele Aspekte der Schriftkultur untersuchen, und zwar sowohl mit
Blick auf in unseren Augen typische Bereiche--Buchveroeffentlichungen,
individuelle und gesellschaftliche Kommunikation--als auch auf
Bereiche, die wir nicht so ohne weiteres mit Schriftlichkeit
verbinden--das Militaer, den Sport, das Design--, die sich aber
dennoch aus dem pragmatischen Handlungszusammenhang ergeben haben,
der die Schriftkultur--zwangslaeufig--hervorgebracht hat.

Als die Philosophie nicht mehr laenger als Dachwissenschaft anerkannt
war, begann die Fragmentarisierung des Wissens.  Der Zweifel, dass es
ein gemeinsames Instrument fuer den Zugang zu und die Verbreitung von
Wissen geben koennte, ist ersetzt durch die Sicherheit, dass es dies
nicht gibt.  Eine sogenannte dritte Kultur--jedenfalls nach Ansicht
dessen, der die oeffentliche Aufmerksamkeit darauf lenkte--, "besteht
darin, die tiefere Bedeutung unseres Lebens sichtbar zu machen", und
zwar nicht so, wie dies literarisch gebildete Intellektuelle tun
wuerden.  Hierbei handelt es sich nicht um C. P. Snows Third Culture
aus Wissenschaftlern, die sich mit nicht wissenschaftlich taetigen
Intellektuellen verstaendigen, sondern um den
populaerwissenschaftlichen Diskurs, der faszinierende Themen ins
Zentrum der allgemeinen Aufmerksamkeit rueckt.  Daher werden wir auch
die Beziehung zwischen Schriftkultur einerseits und Wissenschaft und
Philosophie andererseits untersuchen und auf diese Weise den Ort von
Philosophie und Wissenschaft jenseits der Schriftkultur naeher zu
umreissen versuchen.

Wie aber koennen wir diese weitreichende Veraenderung untersuchen und
angemessen evaluieren?  Sind wir nicht in den Fesseln der Sprache und
Bildung und damit den auf ihnen gruendenden philosophischen und
wissenschaftlichen Erklaerungen gefangen?  Natuerlich ist das System,
das sich in unserer Kultur festgesetzt hat, das Ergebnis einer
logokratischen Sichtweise.  Wenn wir Fertigkeiten und Leistungen mit
Zensuren belegen, so beziehen sich diese meist auf eine Form des
Verstehens, die fuer die Schriftkultur charakteristisch ist.  Doch der
neue pragmatische Handlungsrahmen erfordert Fertigkeiten, die sich
nicht nur auf Sprache und Schriftlichkeit beziehen, sondern auf
Bilder, Geraeusche, Texturen, Bewegung, virtuellen Raum und Zeit.  Wir
muessen also die Beziehung zwischen einem relativ statischen Medium
und dynamischen Medien genauer untersuchen und fragen, wie sich
Schriftlichkeit zum Visuellen im allgemeinen verhaelt und im
besonderen zur kontrovers bewerteten Wirklichkeit des Fernsehens, der
interaktiven Multimedien, kuenstlicher Bilder, elektronischer
Netzwerke und virtueller Wirklichkeiten.  Diese wichtige Aufgabe
erfordert einen breiten Ansatz und einen unvoreingenommenen
Standpunkt.

Zunaechst muessen wir die strukturalen Implikationen von
Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur verstehen.  Wenn wir uns die
Rahmenbedingungen vergegenwaertigen, die zur Schriftkultur gefuehrt
haben, und die Folgen, die sich aus den neuen pragmatischen
Rahmenbedingungen fuer alle Aspekte unseres Lebens ergeben, koennen wir
verstehen, wie die Schriftkultur sie beeinflusst hat.  Hier denke ich
besonders an Religion, Familie, Staat und Ausbildung.  In einer Welt,
in der die Kategorie der Dauerhaftigkeit ihre Gueltigkeit verloren hat,
ist auch fuer eine grosse Zahl der Menschen jegliche Gottesvorstellung
verloren gegangen.  Dennoch gibt es heute mehr Kirchen,
Glaubensgemeinschaften, Sekten oder andere religioese Gruppierungen
(atheistische und neoheidnische eingeschlossen) als zu jeder anderen
Zeit unserer Geschichte.  In den USA wechselt man durchschnittlich 2,
8 Mal im Leben seinen Lebensgefaehrten (sofern man je eine Familie
gruendet) und kalkuliert die finanziellen Aspekte der Familiengruendung
mit der gleichen Praezision, mit der man erwartete Investitionsertraege
kalkuliert.  Der Staat ist zu einem Wirtschaftsunternehmen geworden,
das die Geschaefte der Nation reguliert, und wird dementsprechend an
seinen wirtschaftlichen Erfolgen gemessen.  Staatspraesidenten sind
zunehmend die Handlanger grosser Industrieunternehmen, von deren
Erfolg die Arbeitsplaetze abhaengen.  Diese Staatsoberhaeupter geben im
Zweifelsfall die im gebildeten Diskurs der Schriftlichkeit
verankerten Ideale preis (z. B. die Menschenrechte).  Aber sie
machen viel Laerm, wenn es um Fragen wie Einschraenkung des Copyrights
geht, besonders bei der Software.  Ironischerweise ist gerade das
Copyright bei digitalen Originalen nur schwer zu definieren.  In dem
von der Schriftkultur geschaffenen Modell hat sich der Staat zu einer
buerokratischen Selbsterhaltungsmaschine entwickelt, die den
vielfaeltigen Optionen kaum noch gerecht wird.  Viel mehr Menschen,
als die vorliegenden Berichte es ausweisen, werden oder bleiben nach
Beendigung ihrer Schulausbildung und selbst nach einer
weiterfuehrenden Ausbildung ungebildet.  Obwohl sie in der Regel lesen
und schreiben gelernt haben, ziehen sie Fernsehen, Spiele,
Sportveranstaltungen oder das Internet vor.  Somit ist das Gegenteil
von Schriftkultur nicht nur Unbildung, sondern bewusste Distanz zu
Bildung und Schriftkultur.  Die Entscheidung, auf Lesen und Schreiben
zu verzichten, ist eine Entscheidung zugunsten anderer Ausdrucks- und
Kommunikationsmittel.  Die heutige Generation geht mit Videospielen
sicherer um als mit der Rechtschreibung.  Sie erwirbt auf diese Weise
praktische Erfahrungen von allerhoechster Effizienz, die in ihrer
Struktur dem interaktiven Spielzeug aehneln und von Rechtschreibung
und Schreibfertigkeit weit entfernt sind.  Wenn es darum geht, was
die heutige Generation wissen will, wie, wann und zu welchem Zweck
sie das Wissen erwerben will, hat das Internet Zeitungen, Buecher,
Zeitschriften und selbst Radio und Fernsehen ersetzt.  Und
mittlerweile sogar die Schulen und weiterfuehrenden Ausbildungsstaetten.
Mit seinen enormen und ausbaufaehigen Mitteln und Angeboten
verknuepft das Internet den Einzelnen mit dem Rest der Welt, statt nur
ueber Globalitaet zu reden.  Networking, das Arbeiten im Internet auf
allen Ebenen und in vielerlei Formen, ist eines der wesentlichen
Merkmale unseres neuen pragmatischen Handlungsrahmens.  So rudimentaer
diese Arbeitsform auch noch ausgebildet ist, Schnelligkeit und
Praezision sind ihre wesentlichen Kennzeichen.

Muessen wir in diesen Entwicklungen den Grund fuer den Niedergang der
Schriftkultur sehen?  Koennen wir also sagen, dass die Menschen in dem
Masse, in dem sie ueber geringere Lese- und Schreibfertigkeiten
verfuegen oder sich gegen das Lesen und Schreiben entscheiden, auch
weniger an Gott glauben und fuer eine gottlose Existenz optieren?  Dass
mit Zunahme der Scheidungsrate die Zahl der geschlossenen Ehen oder
der Kinder sinkt?  Dass die UEberantwortung ihrer Probleme an eine
buerokratische Maschine zu hoeherem Fernsehkonsum, mehr elektronischen
Spielen und vermehrtem Surfen in der unbegrenzten Welt des Networks
fuehrt?  Gewiss nicht, jedenfalls nicht in dieser eindimensionalen,
linearen, vereinfachten Kausalitaet.  Viele Faktoren und viele
unterschiedliche Betrachtungsebenen gilt es zu beruecksichtigen.  Sie
wurzeln allesamt im pragmatischen Rahmen unserer nichtendenden
Selbstsetzung.  Diese findet ihren Ausdruck in der Dynamik immer
kuerzerer und schnellerer Interaktionsformen.  Sie sieht sich vor
staendig neuen Wahlmoeglichkeiten, die unsere Identitaet bestaetigen.
Verfuegbarkeiten, Fragmentation, globale Integration und erhoehte
Vermittlung sind ihre Kennzeichen.  Die hier beschriebene Dynamik
entspricht der hoeheren Effizienz, beides Voraussetzungen fuer die
erweiterte Skala menschlicher Aktivitaet.  Wir wollen in einem ersten
Schritt die Aufmerksamkeit auf die Multidimensionalitaet dieses
Vorgangs und auf die vielen Interdependenzen lenken, die wir mit
Hilfe der neuen Technologien schliesslich offenlegen koennen.  Ein
weiterer Schritt in meiner Argumentation wird es sein, ihre
Nicht-Linearitaet darzulegen, die das Ineinandergreifen von
deterministischen und vermutlich eher nicht-deterministischen
Faktoren erhellt.

Wir muessen unsere Diskussion dabei auf das praktische menschliche
Handeln richten.  Anders waere es nicht moeglich zu erklaeren, warum
trotz aller Bemuehungen und trotz aller finanziellen Mittel, die die
Gesellschaft in die Ausbildung investiert hat, und trotz aller
Erforschung der auf Schriftkultur basierenden Erkenntnisprozesse der
Mensch am Ende weniger gebildet, aber ueberraschenderweise keineswegs
weniger leistungsfaehig geworden ist.  Manch einer wird dagegenhalten,
dass der Mensch ohne Schriftkultur und Bildung als Mensch weniger
leistungsfaehig sein wird--wie es Alan Bloom in seinem Kreuzzug fuer
Kultur und Bildung mit seinem brillanten Epilog auf die menschliche
Kultur bereits getan hat.  Eine unvoreingenommene Debatte ueber solche
Fragen setzt allerdings voraus, dass wir die Veraenderbarkeit und
Veraenderung im Status des Menschen und menschlicher Gesellschaften
akzeptieren und dass wir verstehen, was solche Veraenderungen
unvermeidbar macht.


Der weise Fuchs

Die heutige Welt, besonders ihr industrialisierter Teil, ist
fundamental anders als alles, was ihr vorausgegangen ist--vor einem
Jahrzehnt, vor einem Jahrhundert, gar nicht zu reden von jener Zeit,
die mehr in den Bereich von Geschichten und weniger in den Bereich
der Geschichte gehoert.  Alan Bloom und mit ihm viele andere
Intellektuelle gehen von dem tief verwurzelten Glauben aus, dass der
Mensch nicht effektiv sein kann, wenn er sein Handeln nicht auf die
Grundlage historisch gewachsener und erprobter Werte stellt.  Aber
der Weg unserer Entwicklung hat eine Gabelung erreicht, an der es
keine bevorzugten Richtungen, sondern nur zahllose Optionen gibt.
Wir leben nicht in einer Krisenzeit, obwohl manche das gern so
darstellen und auch gleich mit Loesungsmodellen aufwarten: zurueck zu
irgend etwas (Autoritaet, Buecher, irgendein primitives Stadium des
Non-Ego oder der Bewusstseinserweiterung durch Drogen, zurueck zur
Natur); oder Hals ueber Kopf in die technokratische Utopie, das
Informationszeitalter, die Dienstleistungsgesellschaft, vielleicht
sogar die virtuelle Wirklichkeit oder ein kuenstliches Leben.

Menschen sind heuristische Lebewesen.  Unsere Gesellschaft zeichnet
sich aus durch Kreativitaet und Vielfalt und hat zum Wirkungsbereich
eine enorme Bandbreite menschlicher Interaktion, welcher wir
bestaendig neue Bereiche hinzufuegen: den Weltraum, dessen Dimensionen
nur noch in Lichtjahren gemessen werden und dessen Beobachtung sich
ueber mehrere Lebensperioden erstreckt; den Mikrokosmos, der diese
Bandbreite in der entgegengesetzten Richtung der infinitesimalen
Differenzierung widerspiegelt; die voellig neuen Bereiche der von
Menschen erzeugten Materialien, neue Formen der Energie, genetisch
manipulierte Pflanzen und Tiere, neue genetische Codes oder virtuelle
Wirklichkeiten, die uns neue Raeume, neue Zeiten und neue Formen der
Vermittlung erfahren lassen.  Networking, das uns in seinem
gegenwaertigen Entwicklungsstand nur andeutet, was noch auf uns
zukommt, kann in seinen Auswirkungen vermutlich nur mit der
allgemeinen Verfuegbarkeit der Elektrizitaet verglichen werden.  Vor
uns liegt eine kognitive Energie, die durch Netzwerke ausgetauscht
und auf gemeinschaftliche Unternehmen gerichtet ist; all dies steht
im Zusammenhang mit dem exponentiellen Wachstum digitaler Netzwerke
und schnell steigender Lernkurven beim effizienten Umgang mit diesem
Potential.

Der Vergangenheit entspricht ein pragmatischer Handlungsrahmen, der
dem UEberleben und der Fortentwicklung der Menschheit in einer
begrenzten Welt angemessen ist, einer Welt, die aus unmittelbarer
Begegnung und Zusammenarbeit und begrenzter Vermittlung bestand.
Gemessen an den Massstaeben einer Kultur, die auf Schriftlichkeit und
der entsprechenden Form von Bildung und Schriftkultur gruendet,
erweisen sich der abnehmende Bildungsstand und die geringere
Bedeutung der Schriftkultur als Zeichen einer Krise, vielleicht sogar
eines Zusammenbruchs.  Der neue pragmatische Handlungszusammenhang
ist jedoch gekennzeichnet durch die Verlagerung von diesem auf die
Schriftkultur bezogenen Modell hin zu von der Schriftkultur
abweichenden vielfaeltigen Formen von Bildung und Kultur, die
miteinander verbunden, aufeinander bezogen und voneinander abhaengig
sind.  Ein Teil der heutigen Menschheit stellt sich dieser
Herausforderung, ohne sich um die damit verbundenen Implikationen zu
sorgen.  Man verzichtet darauf, die gegenwaertigen Vorgaenge und
Implikationen in vollem Umfang zu verstehen, solange man ausreichend
Aufregung und Genugtuung aus ihnen beziehen kann.  Hollywood lebt
recht gut davon, ebenso die digitalen Illusionsindustrien.  Die
Adressen im Internet verschwinden ebenso schnell wieder, wie sie
gekommen sind.  Eine vielversprechende Verbindung von gestern kann
schon heute nur noch mit einem "sorry" antworten, wie wichtig und
bedeutungsvoll sie auch gewesen sein mag.  Es ist noch niemals
sinnvoll gewesen, sich dem Erfolg entgegenzustellen.  Der Erfolg
verdient es, in seinen authentischen Erscheinungsformen gepriesen zu
werden, und diese bringen nachhaltige Veraenderungen fuer den Menschen
mit sich.

Das Bild der Zukunft, das sich hinter solchen Bezeichnungen wie
Technokratie, Informationszeitalter und Dienstleistungsgesellschaft
verbirgt, mag einige Charakteristika der heutigen Welt erfassen, aber
es ist begrenzt und begrenzend.  Es traegt der neuen Skala der
menschlichen Handlungsmoeglichkeiten nicht genuegend Rechnung.  Es
behaelt als zugrundeliegende Struktur die gegenwaertige Form von
Abhaengigkeiten der an der menschlichen Aktivitaet teilhabenden vielen
Teile bei, einschliesslich der dazugehoerigen vereinfachten
deterministischen Perspektive.  Eine gedankenlose Befuerwortung der
Technokratie muss mit der gleichen Zurueckhaltung beurteilt werden wie
deren Verteufelung.  Die Rolle, die die Technologie derzeit fuer die
menschliche Taetigkeit spielt, ist in der Tat beeindruckend.  Gleiches
gilt fuer das Ausmass von Informationsvermittlung und fuer das
Verhaeltnis von produktiven Leistungen und Dienstleistungen.  Eine
wichtige zukuenftige Aufgabe wird darin liegen, die Unmenge von Daten
sinnvoll zusammenzufuehren und aus ihnen neue produktive Impulse zu
entwickeln.  Parallel hierzu hat die Wissenschaft neue provokative
Theorien und entsprechend modifizierte Weltmodelle bereitgestellt.

Letztlich sind dies alles aber nur Einzelheiten einer sehr viel
umfassenderen Entwicklung, an deren Ende ein voellig neuer
pragmatischer Handlungsrahmen steht.  Er ist gekennzeichnet durch
extrem vermittelte Arbeit, verteilte Aufgaben, parallel verlaufende
Arbeitsablaeufe und eine allgemeine Vernetzung von ansonsten eher nur
lose koordinierten individuellen Erfahrungen.  In diesem Rahmen ist
auch das Verhaeltnis von Input (der Arbeit) und Output (deren
Ergebnis) quantitativ und qualitativ voellig neu zu definieren.  Es
ist nicht mehr zu vergleichen mit dem mechanischen Verhaeltnis
zwischen aufgewendeter Energie (z. B. Druck auf einen Hebel) zu
Resultat (Maschinelle Leistung).  Der Unterschied zwischen Input und
Output als solcher wird verschwommener.  Der tragbare Computer
ermoeglicht neue und stets effektivere Formen der Koordinierung von
Arbeitsablaeufen und der gemeinsamen Vernetzung--der Anstieg der
Taktfrequenz kann als Ergebnis einer erhoehten koerperlichen Aktivitaet
gedeutet werden oder aber auch zum Anlass genommen werden, mit einer
Arztpraxis oder einer Polizeistation (im Falle eines Unfalls) in
Verbindung zu treten.  Es ist durchaus denkbar, dass unser genetischer
Kode Bestandteil zukuenftiger Interaktion sein wird, nachdem heute
schon Gedanken den Computer steuern koennen.

Unsere Sprachfaehigkeit und die Faehigkeit, ihre verschiedenen
Implikationen zu verstehen, sind nur bedingt voneinander abhaengig und
daher auch nur bedingt erforschbar und verstehbar.  In dieser
Feststellung liegt keine Resignation, eher Ungewissheit: Sie ist indes
fuer die Integritaet des vorliegenden Unternehmens von entscheidender
Bedeutung.  Solange wir uns innerhalb einer Sprache bewegen,
betrachten wir die Welt aus ihrer Perspektive; sie ist das Medium
unserer Selbstkonstituierung, Identitaetsfindung und Evaluierung.  Sie
beeinflusst unsere Sichtweise und unsere Darstellungen.  Sie
beeinflusst darueber hinaus auch das, was wir nicht mehr selbst
erkennen, was sich unserer Erkenntnis entzieht, mehr noch, sie
filtert es bis zu einem Masse, dass man nur noch die eigenen Gedanken
wahrnimmt.  Diese doppelte Identitaet--als Beobachter und als
integraler Bestandteil der beobachteten Phaenomene--bringt kaum
loesbare ethische, axiologische und epistemologische Probleme mit sich.
Jede Sprache ist eine Projektion der Menschen, die sie sprechen,
daher sehen wir weniger die Welt als uns selbst in Beziehung zu ihr,
als diejenigen, die die Kultur hervorbringen, als diejenigen, die die
uns umgebende Welt unterwerfen und uns anpassen.  Der Fuchs in
Saint-Exuperys Der Kleine Prinz kann dies viel besser ausdruecken:
"Man versteht nur die Dinge, die man zaehmt."


"Und zwischen uns der Abgrund"

Unser Bild von der Industriegesellschaft besteht aus riesigen
Industriekomplexen, in denen eine grosse Schar von Arbeitern Gueter
produziert, und aus dichten Ballungszentren, die um diese
Produktionsstaetten herum angesiedelt wurden.  Die neue Wirklichkeit,
die aus nicht nur per Telecommuting miteinander verbundenen, aber
dezentralisierten individuellen Handlungen besteht, bietet ein anders
Bild.  Verschiedene Vermittlungselemente tragen zu den zunehmend
effizienteren Erfahrungen der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung bei.
Der Computer ist dabei nur einer von vielen Vermittlungsmechanismen.
Seine Funktionen des Rechnens, der Wort-, Bild- und
Informationsverarbeitung sowie der Produktionskontrolle schieben
zahlreiche Vermittlungsebenen zwischen den Menschen und das, worauf
er sein Handeln richtet.  Die Vernetzungstechnologie ermoeglicht neue
Strategien der Arbeitsaufteilung und erleichtert parallel ablaufende
Produktionstaetigkeiten.  Diese elektronisch vernetzte Welt ist durch
zunehmende Dezentralisierung und neue interoperative Moeglichkeiten
gekennzeichnet.  In ihr werden mancherlei Maschinen zu unseren
direkten Adressaten, denen wir alle denkbaren Aufgaben vom Design bis
zur computerunterstuetzten Produktion uebertragen.  Solche
Arbeitsformen und die dafuer notwendigen kognitiven Funktionen
befoerdern eine Praxis, die sich von den mechanischen Arbeitsablaeufen
der industriellen Produktionsweise qualitativ unterscheidet.  Diese
Beschreibung passt nicht in allen Einzelheiten auf grosse Teile von
Afrika, Asien und Lateinamerika und auf einige Bereiche von Europa
und Nordamerika.  Weltweit ist die industrielle Produktionsweise noch
vorherrschend.  Und obwohl heute selbst die entlegensten Staemme
Bestandteil unserer integrierten Welt sind, hat die industrielle
Revolution noch laengst nicht alle von ihnen erreicht.  Manche von
ihnen haben noch nicht einmal die Vorstufen der Landwirtschaft
erreicht.  Doch gerade mit Blick auf die globale Natur unserer
heutigen Praxis halte ich es fuer denkbar, dass trotz der enormen
oekonomischen und sozialen Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen Teilen
dieser Welt die fuer die industrialisierten Wirtschaften typische
zentralistische Produktionsweise nicht fuer alle ein notwendiges
Entwicklungsstadium sein muss.  Die aus der globalen Skala heraus
entstandenen Effizienzerwartungen koennen nur durch
Entwicklungsstrategien verwirklicht werden, die sich von der
industriellen Praxis unterscheiden.  Daher ist es durchaus denkbar,
dass Laender und Subkontinente im Vorstadium der industriellen
Revolution diese nicht unbedingt durchlaufen muessen.  In einem
anderen Zusammenhang haben OEkologen und Politiker (H. Schmidt) im
uebrigen empfohlen, dass Entwicklungslaender gezielt eine andere
Entwicklung einschlagen sollten: Die Industrielle Revolution hat zwar
den Lebensstandard der Industrienationen gehoben, aber nur auf Kosten
der Umwelt und der natuerlichen Ressourcen.  (Ein deutsches Manifest,
1992).

Die industrielle Produktion und die damit verbundenen
Sozialstrukturen beruhen auf Schriftkultur.  Edmund Carpenter hat das
treffend formuliert: "In Gaenge und Hebel uebersetzt wurde das Buch zur
Maschine.  In Menschen uebersetzt wurde es zur Armee, zur Befehlskette,
zum Fliessband...".  Zu Beginn der industriellen Revolution waren
Frauen und Kinder Teil des Arbeitsmarktes.  Fuer ihre sehr begrenzten
Arbeitsprozesse war eine Schriftkultur nicht unbedingt noetig.
Dennoch konnte sich die weitere Entwicklung der Industriegesellschaft
nur durch die allgemeine Verbreitung schriftkultureller Fertigkeiten
vollziehen.  Erst die Erfindung der Stahlfeder 1830 ermoeglichte die
Einfuehrung der allgemeinen Grundschulpflicht.  Die Stahlnadel
veraenderte zunaechst scheinbar nur die haeuslichen Taetigkeiten, in
Wirklichkeit aber wurde sie zu den harten Bedingungen industrieller
Massenproduktion.  Gas und Elektrizitaet verlaengerten die Zeitraeume,
in denen die Fertigkeiten der Schriftkultur vermittelt und verbreitet
werden konnten.  Die Verbesserung der Wohnbedingungen ermoeglichte die
Errichtung von Privatbibliotheken.  Fuer George Steiner war dies ein
entscheidender Schritt zur privaten Buchlektuere.

Die fuer die Industrielle Revolution charakteristischen Phaenomene
stehen im Zusammenhang mit der Herausbildung von Nationalstaaten.
Die Erfahrung und Bestaetigung der nationalen Identitaet ist
unmittelbar an die Werte und Funktionen der Schriftkultur geknuepft.
Die Produktionsprozesse des industriellen Zeitalters mit ihren
mechanischen Maschinen und der Stromkraft setzten anstelle der
Muskelkraft qualifizierte Kraft voraus.  Verwaltungs- und
Managementfunktionen erforderten mehr Schriftlichkeit als die Arbeit
am Fliessband.  Aber die Charakteristika der Schriftlichkeit wirkten
sich auf den gesamten Handlungszusammenhang aus und liessen eine
allgemeingebildete Arbeiterschaft wuenschenswert erscheinen.  Der in
dieser Entwicklung entstandene Markt projizierte die Bedingungen der
Industrie auf die Strukturen des Marktes.  Der Bedarf an
qualifizierter Arbeit fuehrte zu einem Bedarf an qualifiziertem
Marktverhalten und schliesslich zu den heutigen Formen von Marketing
und Werbung.  Der Markt war in der Regel definiert durch nationale
Grenzen; diese Grenzen der Effizienz, der Autarkie und des
zukuenftigen Wachstums ermoeglichten Maerkte von einer Groesse und
Komplexitaet, die dem industriellen Output entsprachen.  Die
Nationalstaaten hoben in gewisser Weise die Fragmentarisierung der
Welt auf.  Nationalstaaten waren nicht mehr laenger die theoretische
Verkleidung von Stammesstrukturen, sondern ein politischer Raum fuer
die allmaehliche Einrichtung der Demokratie.

Dem Fortschritt von miteinander um das UEberleben konkurrierenden
Individuen in einem Umfeld, in dem nur der Staerkste ueberleben konnte,
hin zu einem gemeinschaftlichen Leben in den Grenzen eines Stammes,
einer Gemeinde, einer Region, einer Konfoederation oder Nation
entspricht die Weiterentwicklung menschlicher Integrationsformen und
-methoden.  Die globale Skala unserer heutigen Lebenspraxis ist nicht
nur eine einfache Erweiterung der linearen deterministischen
Beziehungen zwischen den Menschen und seinem lebenserhaltenden System,
der Umwelt.  Tiefe und Ausmass der Veraenderung zeigen sich in der
Diskontinuitaet der Menge (an Menschen, Ressourcen, Erwartungen usw.),
in der Natur der Beziehungen zwischen den Menschen untereinander und
in den fuer die heutige Lebenspraxis symptomatischen
Vermittlungsformen.  Das Ende des Nationalstaats, vielleicht sogar
der Demokratie, mag noch in weiter Zukunft liegen, aber es steht uns
bevor.  Die Vereinten Nationen, denen noch nicht die gesamte Welt
beigetreten ist, bestehen derzeit aus mehr als 197 Nationen, die Zahl
steigt.  Einige davon sind kleine Inselstaaten oder solche, die erst
vor kurzem durch soziale oder politische Bewegungen ihre
Unabhaengigkeit erreicht haben.  Von den ueber 240 verschiedenen
Territorialgebieten, Laendern und Protektoraten sind nur wenige
wirklich autarke Einheiten (sofern es sie ueberhaupt gibt).  Und trotz
einer bislang unuebertroffenen Integration ist die Welt heute weniger
ein Haus der Nationen und diskreten Allianzen als vielmehr eine
Zivilisation, in der eine Spezies eine starke Kontrolle (nach Meinung
vieler eine zu starke) ueber andere Spezies ausuebt.

In dieser Welt gibt es noch immer Bevoelkerungsgruppen mit
Lebensformen, die auf Jagd, Beutezug, Fischfang und einfachen Formen
der Landwirtschaft basieren.  Tauschhandel und eine rudimentaer
ausgebildete Sprache des UEberlebens stellen an solchen Orten den
einzigen Marktprozess dar; und dennoch ist die gesamte Welt in die
globalen Transaktionen eingebunden.  Maerkte in ihrer Ganzheit stehen
zur Disposition, oft genug ohne das Wissen derer, aus denen dieser
Markt besteht.  Die Charta der Zukunft wird weniger die seit jeher
leidenschaftlich verfochtene nationale Unabhaengigkeit sein als das
(authentische oder eingebildete) kulturelle Gedaechtnis.  Kaufen oder
Verkaufen uebertraegt sich auf die gesamte Wirtschaft, welche, obwohl
bis heute nicht in ihrem Gesamtzusammenhang vollkommen verstanden und
erklaert, sich in einem Rhythmus veraendern wird, dem diejenigen, die
sie eigentlich kontrollieren sollen, nur schwer standhalten werden.
Gleichwohl ist diese Entwicklung im Zusammenhang eines globalen
Marktes unausweichlich.  Es kann nicht ueberraschen, dass Bildung,
Schriftkultur und nationale Identitaet von dieser Entwicklung
ebenfalls erfasst werden.


Wiedersehen mit Malthus

Das malthusianische Prinzip von 1798 setzte das Bevoelkerungswachstum
(geometrisch) in Beziehung zu einem erhoehten Nahrungsangebot
(arithmetisch).  Die Schwaeche dieses Prinzips liegt vermutlich darin,
dass die Gleichung fuer das Schicksal der Menschheit aus mehr als nur
zwei Variablen, der Bevoelkerung und dem Nahrungsangebot, besteht.
Der ausgiebige Rueckgriff auf natuerliche Ressourcen besonders in der
Landwirtschaft ist nur eine unter vielen Erfahrungen.  Die
Wirklichkeit des Menschen besteht nicht nur aus biologischen
Beduerfnissen, sondern auch aus kulturellen Erwartungen, wachsender
Nachfrage und Kreativitaet.  Und diese wirken sich auf die sogenannten
Primaerbeduerfnisse und Instinkte aus.  Zahlreiche bislang bekannte
Proteinquellen sind erschoepft.  Aber gleichzeitig haben wir unzaehlige
neue Ernaehrungsquellen erschlossen, nicht zuletzt die kuenstlich
geschaffenen.  Jagd und Sammlertaetigkeit, auch die daraus
weiterentwickelten Formen der Landwirtschaft und Viehzucht erwiesen
sich als angemessen, solange das menschliche Verhalten durch lineare,
sequentielle Lebensstrategien bestimmt war.

In Verbindung mit dieser linearen Lebenspraxis wurde die Sprache
entwickelt und in der menschlichen Lebenspraxis etabliert.
Linearitaet heisst hier nichts anderes, als dass ein Mensch weniger
effektiv ist als zwei, und umgekehrt, dass die Beduerfnisse eines
Menschen geringer sind als diejenigen von mehreren Menschen.  Die
Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen durch Sprache bewahrt diese Form
der Linearitaet.  Sie bewahrte und entwickelte ihre Funktion, solange
Umfang, Beduerfnisse und Sehnsuechte der menschlichen
Lebensgemeinschaft proportionale Formen der Interaktion zwischen den
Individuen untereinander und den Individuen und ihrer Lebensumwelt
moeglich machte.  Mit der Industriegesellschaft hat die Menschheit
vermutlich den Hoehepunkt ihrer Optimierungsbemuehungen erreicht.

Heute geht es darum, geometrisch anwachsende Bevoelkerungen und
exponentiell (d. h. nicht-linear) auseinanderstrebende Erwartungen zu
vereinbaren.  Diese Erwartungen betreffen Menschen, die ein hoeheres
Durchschnittsalter erreichen und deren aktives Berufsleben laenger ist
als frueher.  Auch anatomisch veraendern wir uns, nicht zwangslaeufig
zum Guten: Insgesamt sehen und hoeren wir schlechter und verfuegen ueber
geringere physische Kraefte.  Ebenso veraendern sich unsere
Denkfaehigkeiten und Denkgewohnheiten und die Strukturen des sozialen
Zusammenlebens.  Letzere spiegeln u. a. den UEbergang von
unmittelbaren Formen der Interaktion und des Miteinanders zu
indirekten, vermittelten Formen der menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung
in der Lebenspraxis.

Der sequentielle Charakter der Sprache, wie er sich besonders in der
Schriftlichkeit niederschlaegt, dient nicht mehr laenger als allgemein
gueltiger Massstab dieser Lebenspraxis.  Strategien der Linearisierung
werden zunehmend ersetzt durch effizientere und im wesentlichen
nicht-lineare Strategien, die durch solche Schriftlichkeiten
ermoeglicht wurden, die sich strukturell von denen der sogenannten
natuerlichen Sprachen unterscheiden.  Demgemaess verliert
Schriftlichkeit ihren urspruenglichen Rang.  Neue Formen der
Schriftlichkeit, neue Sprachen, entstehen.  Und anstelle eines
einzigen stabilen Zentrums und einer begrenzten Zahl von Optionen
sehen wir uns einer aufgefaecherten und variablen Konfiguration vieler
Zentren und umfangreicher Optionsmoeglichkeiten gegenueber, die
gemeinsame oder unvereinbare Interessen verknuepfen oder aufloesen.
Noch immer gibt es nationalstaatliche Ambitionen, noch immer werden
riesige Fabriken gebaut, Staedte errichtet, Verkehrsnetze und
Flughaefen erweitert, um den Verkehr zwischen den Ballungszentren zu
optimieren.  Und dennoch zeichnet sich schon heute eine integrierte
und gleichzeitig dezentralisierte Arbeits- und Lebenswelt ab.  Die
durch die digitale Technologie ermoeglichte allumfassende Verbindung
und Vernetzung oeffnet ungeahnte Moeglichkeiten, unser soziales Leben,
unsere politischen Institutionen und die Gestaltung und Produktion
von Guetern neu zu strukturieren.  Unsere aus der fortgeschrittenen
Spezialisierung gewonnene Faehigkeit zur Vermittlung und zur
Integration von Teilen und Dienstleistungen wird heute von Maschinen
unterstuetzt, welche unsere kognitiven Eigenschaften erweitern.


In den Fesseln der Schriftkultur

Zu den beunruhigendsten Erfahrungen gehoert vermutlich, in der
Konfrontation mit neuen Erfahrungen unser schriftkulturell gepraegtes
Gedaechtnis abschuetteln und uns den in struktureller Hinsicht
amnesischen Zeichensystemen ueberlassen zu muessen, die auf unsere
Sinneserfahrung abzielen.  Neuere Theorien der Welt, des Gehirns und
des Denkens sowie unsere biogenetischen Grundlagen haben uns zu neuen
Erfahrungen der Selbstkonstituierung verholfen, die sich von allem
unterscheiden, was vorausgegangen ist.  Die Erkenntnis der
Relativitaet, der Lichtgeschwindigkeit, von Mikro- und Makrostrukturen,
von dynamischen Kraeften und Nichtlinearitaet hat sich bereits in neue
Strukturen der Interaktion umgesetzt.  Unsere heutigen
Verbindungssysteme--durch elektrische Energie, Telefon, Radio,
Fernsehen, Kommunikationstechnologien aller Art,
Computernetzwerke--arbeiten mit einer dem Licht vergleichbaren
Geschwindigkeit.  Sie verknuepfen dynamische Mechanismen, die von
Genetik, Physik, Molekularbiologie und von unserer Kenntnis der
Mikro- und Makrostruktur angeregt werden.

Unser Lebenszyklus kann sich offenbar auf zwei unterschiedliche
Synchronisationsmechanismen einstellen: Der eine entspricht unserer
natuerlichen Umwelt (Tage, Naechte, Jahreszeiten), der andere unseren
Effizienzbestrebungen und den sich dafuer oeffnenden Moeglichkeiten.
Beide werden immer weniger voneinander abhaengig, und es sieht so aus,
als haette die Effizienz Vorrang vor der Natur.  Ehedem erforderte die
Entdeckung immer weiterer geographischer Dimensionen der Erde Schiffe
und Flugzeuge.  Sie erforderte auch biologische Anstrengungen der
Anpassung und intellektuelle Bemuehungen, die auf diese Weise
erfahrenen Unterschiede zu verstehen und zu verarbeiten.  Im Weltraum
erweist sich die noetige Anpassung als besonders schwierig.  Daher
haben in unserer Welt der permanenten Veraenderung immer haeufiger sich
einstellende Differenzierungen die Menschen veranlasst, an die Stelle
der einen permanenten und allumfassenden Schriftlichkeit verschiedene
Formen der Schriftlichkeit zu setzen, von denen keine den Status
immerwaehrender Gueltigkeit beanspruchen kann.  Die Ausdifferenzierung
und Vielfalt der menschlichen Erfahrung geht heute so weit, dass sie
sich nicht mehr auf eine einzige Form der Schriftkultur reduzieren
laesst.

In der Einrichtung eines gesicherten Wissenskanons, der ueberprueft und
praktisch angewendet werden kann, und in der Entwicklung rationaler
Interpretationsmethoden wurde oft verworfen, was nicht in die
entwickelten Theorien passen wollte, was nicht den Gesetzen gehorchte,
die diese Theorien formulierten.  Dieses methodische Vorgehen war
notwendig, es ermoeglichte letztlich den Fortschritt, dessen Fruechte
wir heute geniessen.  Zugleich war es aber truegerisch, denn es musste
verwerfen, was nicht erklaert werden konnte.  So wurden z. B. ueberall
dort, wo sich die Schriftkultur durchsetzte, die nichtsprachlichen
Aspekte--die auf nichts weiter zurueckzufuehrende Welt der Magie, des
Mysteriums, des Esoterischen (um nur einige zu nennen)--verworfen.
Nun sind aber gerade in vielen Laendern die Folklore, wohl auch der
Aberglaube und alle denkbaren Formen des Mysteriums, soweit sie zur
Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen beitragen, wichtige Bereiche, aus
denen wir Rueckschluesse ueber zurueckliegende, gegenwaertige und
zukuenftige Lebensformen ziehen koennen.  Sie sind Teil des gesamten
Zusammenhangs und sollten nicht einfach abgetan werden, selbst wenn
sie einer Entwicklungsphase zugehoeren, die der Schriftkultur
vorausging.  Gleichwohl war und ist die Sprache das umfassendste
Zeugnis fuer unsere Erfahrungen als menschliche Wesen (und zugleich
ein Teilhaber an dieser Erfahrung), so dass wir schon aus diesem
Grunde untersuchen sollten, ob die Krise, in der sie sich befindet,
etwas aussagt ueber unsere eigene Dauerhaftigkeit und ueber unsere
Vorurteile, die wir ueber unsere eigene Spezies entwickelt haben.  Und
unabhaengig davon stellt sich die Frage, warum und aufgrund welcher
Argumente wir uns eigentlich als das einzige Phaenomen von
Dauerhaftigkeit im Universum und als das hoechstmoegliche
Entwicklungsstadium der Evolution betrachten.  Die Schriftkultur hat
uns in mancherlei Hinsicht unsere Freiheit gegeben.  Doch sie hielt
uns gleichzeitig in einer ganzen Reihe von Vorurteilen gefangen,
nicht zuletzt in einem Bewusstsein von uns selbst, das in direktem
Widerspruch steht zu unserer Erfahrung der permanenten Veraenderung in
der Welt.



Kapitel 2:


Die USA--Sinnbild fuer die Kultur der Schriftlosigkeit

Amerika (unter diesem Namen schlaegt man den Vereinigten Staaten
gemeinhin den Rest der beiden Subkontinente zu) versinnbildlicht in
den Augen von Freund und Feind vieles von dem, was die heutige Welt
kennzeichnet: Marktorientierung, Technologiewahn, Leben auf Kredit
(Kapital und natuerliche Ressourcen), Konkurrenzkampf bis hin zur
Propagierung offener Gegnerschaft und eine Einlassung auf Mittelmass,
Demagogie und Opportunismus im Namen von Demokratie und Toleranz.
Vielen gelten die Amerikaner als prahlerisch, flegelhaft,
unrealistisch, naiv, primitiv, heuchlerisch und geldbesessen.  Und
selbst in den Augen manch eines Patrioten gehoeren Opportunismus,
Korruption und Bigotterie zu den Hauptantriebskraeften dieses Landes.
Anderen erscheint es anfaellig fuer Militarismus und fuer das
verfuehrerische moralische Gift, das sich aus der selbsterklaerten
Vormachtstellung in der Welt ergibt.  Und oft sieht es so aus, als
erwarte es gerade dann Dankbarkeit und Lob, wenn seine Politik
versagt hat.

Andererseits spricht man den Amerikanern aussergewoehnliche
Errungenschaften in Technologie, Wissenschaft, Medizin, in den
Kuensten, der Literatur, im Sport und in der Unterhaltung zu.  Sie
gelten auch als freundlich, offen und tolerant.  Fuer andere Nationen
geradezu beispielhaft ist ihre Bereitschaft, sich fuer altruistische
Projekte zu engagieren (Programme gegen Armut und Unterstuetzung
beduerftiger Kinder auf der ganzen Welt) und ihre Distanz zu jeglicher
Form der Diskriminierung.  Fast ueberall sieht man in Amerika das
Modell einer funktionierenden liberalen Demokratie auf der Grundlage
einer Staatenfoederation, in dem sich lokale, staatliche und foederale
Funktionen die Waage halten.

Und dennoch ist in vielen Teilen der Welt die Angst vor einer
allgemeinen Amerikanisierung verbreitet.  Disneyland vor den Toren
von Paris, MacDonald’s-Fast-food-Ketten, Coca Cola, Blue Jeans,
Popmusik und Fernsehserien, Kaugummi und amerikanischer Sport
symbolisieren allenthalben den Siegeszug der amerikanischen Popkultur
und des amerikanischen Lebensstils.  Doch dieser Eindruck koennte
truegen.

Ausserhalb ihres heimischen Kontextes sind diese Erscheinungen
vielerorts noch exotische Phaenomene, denen man leicht entgegenwirken
kann und tatsaechlich auch nationale Charakteristika entgegensetzt, ob
in Italien, Russland, Deutschland oder Japan.  Auch mit Antworten ist
man leicht zur Hand.  Als es in Deutschland darum ging,
Wirtschaftsprobleme unter Kuerzung von Sozialleistungen fuer
Arbeitnehmer zu loesen, drohte man umgehend, den sogenannten
amerikanischen Loesungen mit einer franzoesischen Antwort zu begegnen:
Gemeint war ein Generalstreik, der das ganze Land lahmlegen sollte.

Bei naeherer Betrachtung steht hinter der Amerikanisierung mehr als
nur eine UEbernahme von Gegenstaenden, Werten und Verhaltensweisen.
Sie erfasst in der globalen Gemeinschaft unserer heutigen Zeit alle
Bereiche der Lebenspraxis.  Es ist nachvollziehbar, warum Amerika
jene Formen der Effizienz repraesentiert, die scheinbar auf Kosten
vieler verlorener Werte gehen: der Achtung vor Autoritaet, vor der
Umwelt, vor natuerlichen oder sogar menschlichen Ressourcen,
schliesslich vor Menschenrechten.  Amerikanische Identitaet ist genaehrt
durch unbegrenzte Erwartungen bezueglich des gesellschaftlichen und
materiellen Lebensstandards, des politischen und wirtschaftlichen
Erfolges, auch der Religionsfreiheit.  Freiheit, zumindest der
Anschein von Freiheit, ist die allgemeine Richtschnur jeglichen
Handelns.  Was immer die Lebenspraxis als moeglich und machbar
erscheinen laesst, wird zu einer neuen Erwartung und alsbald zum
allgemeinen Beduerfnis erhoben.  Ein Recht auf Wohlstand und UEberfluss,
so relativ er in der amerikanischen Gesellschaft auch ausfaellt, wird
als selbstverstaendlich vorausgesetzt, nirgends wird dieser Anspruch
ueberschattet von einer Ahnung davon, dass der eigene Reichtum auf
Kosten der Lebenschancen eines anderen gehen koennte.  Allenthalben
dominiert ein Konkurrenzdenken.  Und manch eine moralisch
zweifelhafte Praxis des politischen und des Rechtssystems macht
dieses Prinzip offenkundig.  "To the victor go the spoils"--"Der
Gewinner bekommt die Beute"--keine andere Formulierung koennte das
amerikanische Lebensgefuehl knapper und passender definieren.

Der "American Way of Life" hat bei vielen Menschen auf der Welt
Hoffnungen und Erwartungen geweckt, trotz der gemischten Gefuehle, mit
denen man Amerika ansonsten begegnet.  Mehr als von dem Zwang, den
amerikanischen Lebensstil nachzuahmen (in Konsum, Lebensweise,
Politik und Verhalten), ist der Rest der Welt vermutlich von dem
Verlangen getrieben, jene Effizienz zu erreichen, die eben diesen
Lebensstandard ermoeglicht.  Jedes Land sieht sich dem Konflikt
zwischen Effizienz und Kultur ausgesetzt.  Manch ein Land kann dabei
auf eine Kultur zurueckblicken, die mehrere tausend Jahre alt ist, im
Gegensatz zu den USA, wo sich Kultur stets in einem status nascendi
befunden hat.  Wenn sich heute in den USA gelegentlich Sorge
bezueglich des Niedergangs von Bildung und Schriftkultur einstellt, so
ist sie offenkundig von einer Nostalgie fuer Tradition gespeist, die
in den USA niemals wirklich wirksam war, und zugleich aus einer
Furcht vor der Zukunft, die man niemals wirklich durchdacht hat.
Insofern ist die Frage, inwiefern die USA eine Kultur
versinnbildlichen, in der die Schriftkultur ueberfluessig geworden ist,
von mehr als nur dokumentarischem Interesse.


Dem Handel zuliebe

Man koennte Amerika, jahrhundertelang von nicht enden wollenden
Einwanderungswellen ueberrollt, etwas oberflaechlich als eine Kultur
mit mehreren nebeneinander existierenden Schriftkulturen bezeichnen.
Noch heute gehoeren in sich geschlossene ethnisch definierte
Wohngebiete zum Lebensalltag.  Hier gibt es Geschaefte, in denen nur
die Sprache dieser ethnischen Gemeinschaft gesprochen wird, und
Zeitungen in dieser Sprache; das Kabelfernsehen versorgt diese
Gruppen mit eigenen Programmen, und ein entsprechendes Warenangebot
erinnert an authentische Kueche und an Produkte, "die ewig halten".
Natuerlich sind alle diese mitgebrachten Schriftkulturen Mittel der
Selbstkonstituierung, dienen dem Brueckenschlag zwischen den Kulturen,
die es in der dritten Generation nicht mehr geben wird.  Indem sich
die Menschen der Schriftkultur ihres Herkunftlandes verpflichtet
fuehlen, erfahren sie sich als gespaltene Persoenlichkeiten zwischen
zwei unterschiedlichen pragmatischen Kontexten.  Der eine verkoerpert
die Erwartungen, die sich aus dem auf Schriftkultur gruendenden
Kontext ergaben--Homogenitaet, Hierarchie, Zentralismus, Tradition.
Der neue Kontext der auserwaehlten neuen Heimat rueckt indes
Beduerfnisse in den Mittelpunkt, die den UEbergang zu einer Kultur der
Schriftlosigkeit kennzeichnen--Heterogenitaet, Horizontalitaet,
Dezentralismus, Tradition als Option, nicht aber als Lebensstil.

Wir sollten indes Probleme der Immigration (wie ueberhaupt die der
Migration) nicht unter der Perspektive von nebeneinander
existierenden Schriftkulturen ansehen, sondern eher als Variationen
innerhalb eines verbindenden pragmatischen Handlungsrahmens.  Die
Losloesung der Einwanderer von ihrer Heimatkultur gehoert vielleicht zu
den einmaligen Kennzeichen Amerikas.  Sie ist bis heute eine Quelle
fuer Vitalitaet und Kreativitaet, allerdings auch fuer Konflikte und
Spannungen.  Die Einwanderer kommen als in ihren Schriftkulturen
gebildete an und muessen erfahren, dass ihre Schriftkultur relativ
nutzlos ist.  Dies war keineswegs immer so.  Neil Postman hat gezeigt,
dass die Siedler des 17. Jahrhunderts gemessen an den Massstaeben ihrer
Zeit relativ gebildet waren. 95% der maennlichen Einwanderer konnten
die Bibel lesen; bei den weiblichen Einwanderern waren es immerhin
62%.  Man las auch andere Texte, einige wurden aus England importiert.
In der zweiten Haelfte des 18. Jahrhunderts entwickelte sich eine
Druckindustrie mit erheblichem Einfluss auf das kulturelle Leben
Amerikas.

Mit ihren Schriftkulturen brachten die englischen, franzoesischen und
hollaendischen Einwanderer alle Merkmale der Schriftkultur mit, welche
schliesslich die Grundlage des amerikanischen Regierungssystems
bildeten.  Die nachfolgenden Einwanderungswellen brachten gelernte
und ungelernte Arbeiter, Intellektuelle und Bauern.  Sie alle mussten
sich der fremden Kultur anpassen, die sich zunaechst am britischen
Modell orientierte, spaeter aber seine eigenen Merkmale herausbildete.
Die unterschiedlichen nationalen und ethnischen Gruppierungen mit
ihren jeweils unterschiedlichen Erfahrungen der Lebenspraxis ohne
einen gemeinsamen Nenner mussten sich aufeinander und miteinander
einrichten.  Das Land wuchs schnell und mit ihm seine Industrie, das
Verkehrssystem, die Landwirtschaft, ein Bankensystem und die vielen
anderen Dienstleistungen, die durch die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung
ermoeglicht und fuer deren Weiterentwicklung notwendig wurden.  Bis zu
einem gewissen Ausmass war die Schriftkultur ein Teil dieser
Errungenschaften.  Das junge Land entwickelte recht bald eine eigene
Literatur, in der sich die eigenen neuen Erfahrungen widerspiegelten.
Diese Literatur orientierte sich aber weiterhin an der Schriftkultur
des alten Mutterlandes.  Wenn ich betone, dass dies nur zu einem
gewissen Mass der Fall war, dann deshalb, weil die Geschichte einer
jeden einzelnen Errungenschaft zeigt, dass die dieser Schriftkultur
inhaerenten Merkmale unter dem Banner von Voelkerrecht, Demokratie,
Individualitaet und Fortschritt zunehmend in Frage gestellt wurden.

Allerdings erklaert dieser Hintergrund, warum die Amerikaner sich
nicht gern als eine kulturlose Nation bezeichnen lassen.
Verstaendlich ist ebenfalls, dass sie sich aus diesem Grunde auch
weiterhin der Schriftkultur verpflichtet fuehlen und dass viele in ihr
ein Allheilmittel fuer die heutigen Probleme sehen, die sich aus den
schnellen technologischen Veraenderungszyklen, aus den neuen Formen
menschlicher Interaktion und aus der neuen Lebenspraxis ergeben.  Ihr
ererbtes Verhaeltnis zur Geschichte laesst sie keine Muehen und kein Geld
in dem Versuch scheuen, die Entwicklung umzukehren und Amerika zu
seiner alten Groesse oder doch zumindest zu einer gewissen Form der
Stabilitaet zurueckzufuehren.  Moeglicherweise unterliegt man dabei einem
Irrtum oder einem Phantom; denn wenn wir uns die Errungenschaften der
Vereinigten Staaten genauer betrachten, zeigt sich, dass es nicht sehr
viel gibt, was dieses Land zu den kulturellen Riesen vergangener oder
gegenwaertiger Kulturen zaehlen lassen koennte.

Amerika hat im Verlauf seiner Geschichte in einem gewissen Mass immer
den Bruch mit den Werten der Alten Welt verkoerpert.  Die neuen
Siedler der hollaendischen, franzoesischen und englischen Kolonien
hatten zumindest eines gemeinsam: Sie waren der Hierarchie der
zentralen politischen und religioesen Herrschaft und den starren
Regeln des gesellschaftlichen und kulturellen Lebens entflohen, die
gemeinsam eine Ordnung repraesentierten, die sie an ihrem Platz hielt.
Die Maxime eines John Smith, dass die, die nicht arbeiten, auch
nichts zu essen haben, stellte vielleicht die erste Erschuetterung des
europaeischen Wertesystems dar, in dem Sprache und Kultur eng an
Sozialstatus und Privileg geknuepft waren.

Mit ziemlicher Sicherheit kamen die Einwanderer gleich welchen
Standes nicht mit dem Vorsatz, den damals vorherrschenden
Sinnzusammenhang und die vorherrschenden Moralvorstellungen zu
stuerzen.  Jede neue Entwicklung ist zunaechst einmal durch eine Phase
der Nachahmung des Alten gekennzeichnet, von den religioesen Braeuchen
bis hin zu den Arbeits- und Unterhaltungsformen, zu Erziehung,
Kleidung und dem Verhaeltnis zu Randgruppen (Eingeborenen, Sklaven,
religioesen Sekten).  In dieser Phase der Nachahmung etablierte sich
im Sueden der Vereinigten Staaten eine Art von Aristokratie, die dem
englischen Modell nacheiferte.  Als die neuen Kolonialherren der
Oberschicht gegen die ihnen von Koenig George III. auferlegten Steuern
und Strafgesetze protestierten, forderten sie ihre Rechte als
Englaender ein, mit allem, was diese Bezeichnung beinhaltete.
Jeffersons Modell fuer die freien Vereinigten Staaten bedeutete nichts
anderes, als dass der Agrarstaat die klassischen Ideale, die ihn
motivierten, am besten verkoerperte.  Jefferson selbst, ein Landjunker,
der in der Logik der griechischen und roemischen Kultur ausgebildet
war und Sklaven hielt, versinnbildlichte diese auf Schriftkultur
gruendende Lebenspraxis.  Sein Wissen hat er aus Buechern bezogen.
Seine unterschiedlichen Interessen fuer Architektur, Politik,
Planungsaufgaben und Verwaltung konnte er nur in einem pragmatischen
Handlungsrahmen zusammenfuehren, fuer den die Schriftkultur angemessen
war.  Und obwohl er selbst die von seinen Mitbuergern favorisierte
Monarchie ablehnte, konnte er selbst eine koenigliche Macht ausueben,
die im exekutiven Teil der Regierung angelegt war.  Sein Lebenslauf
zeigt, wie man monarchistisches Zentralitaets- und Hierarchiedenken in
die neuen politischen Formen der sich herausbildenden Demokratien
umsetzte.  An dieser fruehen Phase Amerikas koennen wir ablesen, wie
die Schriftkultur das nicht-egalitaere Modell in ein neues Modell
ueberfuehrt und die neuen Ideale der Menschenrechte und der Gleichheit
der Menschen vor dem Gesetz sowie eine neue Vorstellung von Autoritaet
entwickelt hat, die sich aus der Religion ableitet, im politischen
Leben praktiziert wird und auf die Erwartungen der Mitmenschen
ausgerichtet ist.

Neue Paradigmen entwickeln sich wie Schoesslinge aus den alten heraus.
Unter dem Zwang, fuer ihre neue Identitaet einen neuen Handlungsrahmen
zu finden, entwickelten die Einwanderer einen alternativen Kontext
fuer die Entfaltung der industriellen Revolution.  In diesem
Entwicklungsprozess veraenderten sie sich mehr, als sie es hatten
voraussehen koennen.  Politisch schufen sie die neuen Bedingungen, die
ihnen letztlich die Emanzipation von den Zwaengen des von ihnen
zurueckgelassenen politischen Systems brachten.  Damit aenderten sich
ihr Lebensrhythmus, ihre Sprach-, Denk- und sozialen Gewohnheiten.
Als de Toqueville in den 30er Jahren des 19. Jahrhunderts Amerika
bereiste, waren einige Merkmale dieses neuen Paradigmas bereits zu
erkennen.  Spezielle Aufmerksamkeit widmete er dabei den sich
abzeichnenden neuen Werten, die er aus der Tatsache heraus erklaerte,
dass dieses Land frei war von historischen Zwaengen und den Fesseln
gesellschaftlicher und kultureller UEberlieferungen.  Besonders die
auf beruflichen und privaten Nutzen ausgerichtete Haltung gegenueber
Bildung und Ausbildung konnten ihn beeindrucken sowie die Tatsache,
dass Bildung und Kultur nicht Privilegien einer bestimmten Klasse
waren.  Seine Sichtweise war trotz seiner Gelehrsamkeit und seines
Ansehens zwangslaeufig begrenzt.  Die franzoesische Regierung hatte ihn
nach Amerika geschickt, um die Gefaengnisse und Strafanstalten der
Neuen Welt zu untersuchen; fuer uns heute wurde die Untersuchung ein
Dokument dafuer, wie ein hochgebildeter Europaeer die sozialen und
politischen Institutionen jener Zeit aufnahm.  Dabei zeichneten sich
zur Zeit seines Aufenthaltes zahlreiche Merkmale einer Kultur
jenseits der Schriftlichkeit bereits ab.  Er hob die Kuerze der
Regierungszyklen hervor, den weitgehend muendlichen Charakter der
oeffentlichen Verwaltung, die Fluechtigkeit der eingegangenen
Verpflichtungen.  Er sah, dass Amerika in Ermangelung einer eigenen
Geschichte wuerde "Rueckgriff nehmen muessen auf die Geschichte anderer."
In seiner Beschreibung drueckt sich die UEberraschung aus, die die
in Amerika erfahrene Diskontinuitaet, der Wandel und eine in anderen
Teilen der Welt weniger offenkundige Dynamik bei ihm hervorriefen.

Zweifellos formulierte die Neue Welt neue Themen, die von Amerikanern
und Europaeern unterschiedlich angegangen und interpretiert wurden.
Die eher europaeisch orientierten Staedte des amerikanischen
Nordostens--Boston, New York, Philadelphia--hielten ueber
Universitaeten und Wissenschaften, Dichtung, Essayismus und Kuenste
ihre kulturelle Bindung an die Alte Welt aufrecht.  Trotzdem klagte
Washington Irving darueber, dass man in den Vereinigten Staaten nicht
wie in Europa seinen Lebensunterhalt als Schriftsteller verdienen
koennte.  Tatsaechlich arbeiteten viele Schriftsteller als Journalisten
(was eine Form von Schriftstellerei ist) oder als Beamte.  Doch das
wirkliche Amerika gewann westlich des Hudson und jenseits der
Appalachen Gestalt.  Dort spielte die Vergangenheit tatsaechlich so
gut wie keine Rolle.

Als Teilergebnis des Buergerkrieges wurde in Amerika die Sklaverei
abgeschafft.  Zur selben Zeit deutete sich aber auch eine Veraenderung
der Grundstrukturen der amerikanischen Gesellschaft an, die aus der
Schriftkultur hervorgegangen war.  Die industrielle Revolution
vollzog sich in Amerika vor einem Hintergrund, der sich von dem in
Europa ganz wesentlich unterschied--hier hatten wir eine riesengrosse
Insel, die fuer eine kurze Zeit lang relativ autark war.  Und aus der
Lebenspraxis des postindustriellen Zeitalters entwickelten sich neue
Antriebskraefte mit dem Ziel, Amerika fuer die Welt und soviel wie
moeglich von der Welt fuer Amerika zu oeffnen--ohne Ruecksicht darauf,
wie so etwas zu bewerkstelligen war.  Dieser Entwicklungsprozess wirkt
sich unvermindert auf die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung, auf die
Finanzmaerkte, auf die kulturellen Beziehungen und auf das
Bildungswesen aus.


"Das Beste von dem, was nuetzlich ist und schoen"

Man koennte dem entgegenhalten, dass nunmehr weitere 150 Jahre
verstrichen sind und dass die amerikanische Mentalitaet nicht nur durch
den Geschaeftsgeist geformt wurde.  Man kann auf das literarische Erbe
verweisen, das von Washington Irving, Mark Twain, Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathanael Hawthorne, Henry James
geformt wurde.  Die amerikanischen Schriftsteller des 20.
Jahrhunderts fanden weltweite Wertschaetzung und Nachahmung.  Faulkner
und Hemingway sind die bekanntesten Beispiele.  Heute werden selbst
weniger bedeutende amerikanische Schriftsteller in viele europaeische
Sprachen uebersetzt, und zwar aus denselben Gruenden, aus denen man
Disneyland nach Frankreich holte.  Die Amerikaner ihrerseits werden
auf die Theater (mit europaeischem Spielplan) und Opernhaeuser
hinweisen, dabei aber vergessen, dass diese erst relativ spaet
eingerichtet worden sind.  Aber darin liegt kein Widerspruch: solche
Einfluesse haben die Entwicklung in Amerika nur beschleunigt.

Das Bildungswesen ist hierfuer ein gutes Beispiel.  Die amerikanischen
Colleges und Universitaeten aus dem 18. und fruehen 19. Jahrhundert
waren ganz am traditionellen Modell der Bildung um der Bildung willen
ausgerichtet, und das heisst an moralischer und geistiger Bildung
durch das Studium der Klassiker.  Dieses Prinzip konnte sich so lange
halten, bis verschiedene Interessengruppen, vor allem Geschaeftsleute,
die Validitaet eines Bildungsprogramms in Frage stellten, das nur
geringen oder gar keinen pragmatischen Wert besass.  Diese
Institutionen lagen allesamt im Osten--Harvard, Brown, Yale, Columbia,
William and Mary--die Curricula waren identisch mit jenen in der
Alten Welt.  Besucht wurden sie von der Elite Amerikas.  Die
Universitaeten juengeren Datums, die sogenannten Land Grant Colleges,
die sich spaeter zu den State Universities (wie Ohio State University,
Texas A&M) weiterentwickelten, wurden im letzten Viertel des 19.
Jahrhunderts westlich des Alleghenys gegruendet und verfolgten
pragmatischere Bildungsziele--etwa Landwirtschaft und Maschinenbau,
je nach regionalem, nicht nach nationalem Bedarf.

Mit Blick auf diesen Nutzen haben sich die amerikanischen
Universitaeten zunehmend zu Einrichtungen der Berufsausbildung auf
(mehr oder weniger) hohem Niveau entwickelt, die das anbieten, was
die weiterfuehrenden Schulen in der Ausbildung versaeumt haben.  Das
auf den alten Bildungsidealen beruhende Ausbildungsmodell kollidierte
mit den pragmatischen Anforderungen der Berufswelt und mit
antielitaeren politischen Erwartungen; daraus ergab sich eine
merkwuerdig hybride Situation.  Die allmaehliche Veraenderung der
Curricula zeigt, dass Logik, Rhetorik, Kultur, Ehrfurcht vor dem Wort
und den Regeln der Grammatik und Syntax--allesamt Werte, die sich aus
den alten Bildungsvorstellungen und einer allein vorherrschenden
Schriftkultur ergaben--laengst abgeloest worden sind durch
spezialisierte Studien in Philosophie, Literatur und schriftlicher
Kommunikation, genauer: durch ein verwirrendes Angebot an frei zu
waehlenden Spezialkursen.  Seitdem die Literatur ihren romantischen
Anspruch auf Dauerhaftigkeit und Allgemeingueltigkeit aufgegeben hat,
oeffnet sie sich bestaendig wechselnden Betrachtungsweisen, die mit
zunehmendem Opportunismus und zunehmender Geschwindigkeit auf die
jeweils modifizierten Fragestellungen Ruecksicht nehmen: Feminismus,
Multikulturalitaet, Pazifismus.  Wahrheit in der Form von
literarischer Fiktion oder auch nur Hoffnung haben der Ungewissheit
Platz gemacht.  In diesem Zusammenhang verlieren Sprachwissenschaft
und Philologie ihre Bedeutung oder verschwinden vollends aus den
Curricula der Universitaeten.  Ebenso hat die Wirtschaftswissenschaft
ihr philosophisches Rueckgrat verloren und versteht sich zunehmend als
UEbung in Statistik und Mathematik.

Mit Blick auf die heutigen Studienplaene fragen die Studenten
zunehmend nach dem Zweck des Lehrangebots.  Diese Frage stellt sich
vor allem bei Literatur, Mathematik, Philosophie und fast allem, was
im Rahmen der herkoemmlichen Bildung und Schriftkultur als
Grundlagenfach angesehen wurde.  Die Schuld dafuer trifft nicht die
jungen Leute, die das Universitaetssystem durchlaufen.  Sie versuchen
lediglich, sich auf die Erwartungen einzustellen, die an sie
herangetragen werden: erst der Erwerb des Fuehrerscheins, dann ein
Universitaetsdiplom, schliesslich Steuern zahlen.  In Amerika braucht
man ein Universitaetsdiplom nicht, weil der spaetere Beruf eine
akademische Bildung voraussetzt, sondern weil es das
Gleichheitsprinzip erfordert.  In einem Land, das sich historisch aus
dem Widerspruch zu Hierarchie und zu Ungleichheit entwickelt hat,
wird nicht einmal der Anschein von individueller UEberlegenheit
toleriert.  Das Privileg einer Universitaetsausbildung, wie Amerika
sie zunaechst von Europa uebernommen hat, gilt als Ungerechtigkeit.
Daher aehneln die heutigen Universitaeten eher einem Einkaufszentrum.
Universitaetsabschluesse, vom B. A. bis zum Doktorgrad, gelten als
Testat fuer den Besuch einer Universitaet, als Voraussetzung fuer eine
berufliche Karriere, nicht notwendigerweise als Beleg fuer
anstrengende geistige Taetigkeit und entsprechende wissenschaftliche
Leistungsfaehigkeit.  Wer heute eine Universitaet besucht, erwartet
danach einen besseren (d. h. hoeher bezahlten) Job.

Zunehmend bieten die Universitaeten daher auch Studiengaenge an, die
nicht eigentlich auf Bildung, sondern auf Ausbildung abzielen.  Im
gleichen Mass ist der Wert eines Universitaetsabschlusses (nicht der
Preis, den man dafuer bezahlen muss) gesunken.  Manche meinen sogar,
dass bald auch ein Strassenfeger (Hygienetechniker) einen
Universitaetsabschluss benoetigt.  Tatsaechlich wird man wohl einen
Universitaetsabschluss so selbstverstaendlich haben wie heute einen
Schulabschluss.  Und der Lohn eines solchen Hygienearbeiters wird so
hoch sein (dank der Inflation, die mit der Demagogie stets Schritt
gehalten hat), dass ein Universitaetsabsolvent seinen Anspruch
gegenueber einem Bewerber ohne Gymnasialabschluss durchsetzen wird.

Amerika hat sich selten oder nie fuer Gedanken um der Gedanken selbst
willen interessiert.  Allgemeine schoengeistige Faehigkeiten oder
intellektuelle UEberhoehung sind Importe aus der Alten Welt.  Gewiss
haben in der Fruehgeschichte der USA die Transzendentalisten eine
starke geistige Rolle gespielt, aber auch sie haben lediglich die aus
Europa eingefuehrte Saat spriessen lassen.  Sie und andere--etwa die
philosophische Schule, die wir mit Peirce, Dewey, James und Royce
identifizieren--haben im amerikanischen Leben nie wirklich Wurzeln
geschlagen und Blueten getrieben, die man mehr schaetzte als die
importierten.  Amerikas Stolz liegt in seinen Produkten und in seiner
Pragmatik, nicht in seinem Denken und in seinen Visionen.

Dennoch fordern die fuehrenden Vertreter von Industrie und Wirtschaft
immer noch Bildung ein und sagen Schulen und Universitaeten ihre
Unterstuetzung zu.  Bei naeherer Betrachtung erweist sich ihre Haltung
jedoch als doppelzuengig.  Die amerikanische Wirtschaft brauchte
natuerlich Menschen wie Cooper, Edison und Bell; auf ihren
Entdeckungen und Erfindungen wurde die amerikanische Industrie
aufgebaut.  Als sie in Gang gekommen war, benoetigte man Konsumenten
mit ausreichend Geld, um die Produkte dieser Industrie zu kaufen.
Wirtschaft foerderte Bildung als ein allgemeines Recht und verwendete
alle Steuersubventionen darauf, diese Bildung gemaess den Interessen
von Wirtschaft und Industrie auszurichten.  Als Folge zaehlen in der
amerikanischen Gesellschaft Ideen und Gedanken nur auf einer
materiellen Ebene, nur insofern als sie Nuetzlichkeit, Bequemlichkeit,
Luxus und Unterhaltung foerdern, bzw. den Profit erhoehen.  "Je eher,
desto besser" ist eine Maxime, die diesen Effizienzanspruch gut
ausdrueckt, eine Maxime, die sich fuer die Nebenwirkungen von
Produktion und Handlungen nicht interessiert, solange der Hauptzweck
der Profitmaximierung erfuellt ist.  Als "smart fellow" gilt nicht der
gebildete Buerger, sondern der, der reich geworden ist, ganz gleich
mit welchen Mitteln.  Eine derartige Wertschaetzung des materiellen
Erfolges ungeachtet der dafuer aufgewendeten Mittel ist Teil der
amerikanischen Teleologie (die sich bisweilen in trauter Eintracht
mit der amerikanischen Theologie befindet).


Das Rueckspiegelsyndrom

Warum also wenden sich die Amerikaner ueberhaupt noch einer Zeit zu,
in der die Menschen "lesen und schreiben konnten", einer Zeit, in der
"jede Stadt fuenf verschiedene Zeitungen hatte"?  Es liegt vermutlich
daran, dass die grossen Unternehmen, die allesamt ihre Marktposition
vor der Einfuehrung der neuen Kommunikations- und Mediationsmittel
aufgebaut hatten, in diese Schriftkultur investiert haben: in
Zeitungen, Verlagshaeuser und vor allem in Universitaeten.  Aber fuer
Universitaetsabsolventen, die in ihren Studiengebieten keine
Berufsanstellung finden, klingt das Versprechen auf Bildung und den
daraus zu ziehenden Nutzen merkwuerdig hohl.

Was aber hat der neue pragmatische Handlungsrahmen der Neuen Welt den
Bildungsgrundlagen der Schriftkultur an Errungenschaften
entgegenzusetzen?  Zunaechst einmal den wesentlichen Umstand, dass dem
einen beherrschenden, auf Schriftlichkeit und Bildung gruendenden
Handlungsmodus neue Formen des Ausdrucks, der Mitteilung und der
Kommunikation gleichgestellt wurden.  Peter Cooper, der Gruender einer
einflussreichen Stiftung zur Foerderung der Wissenschaft und Kunst in
New York, war im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes Analphabet.  Er konnte
nicht lesen.  Er machte ein Vermoegen in der Eisenbahn-, Klebstoff-
und Gelatineindustrie.  Ganz zweifellos war er nicht ohne Intelligenz.
Das gilt fuer viele Pioniere, die ihre Werkzeuge besser beherrschten
als ihre Fuellfederhalter.  Sie lasen in der Natur mit mehr
Weltverstaendnis, als manche Universitaetsstudenten in ihren Buechern
lesen.  Es gibt andere spektakulaere Beispiele fuer Erfolg jenseits von
Bildung.  Etwa der kalifornische Geschaeftsmann, der als Analphabet 18
Jahre lang Mathematik und Sozialwissenschaften an einer Highschool
unterrichtete und aus nicht ganz nachvollziehbaren Gruenden als
Musterbeispiel fuer die Vorzuege von Bildung zur Fernsehzelebritaet
avancierte.  Menschen wie er greifen auf ein Erinnerungsvermoegen oder
auf Intelligenzformen zurueck, die nicht an die Konventionen der
Schriftlichkeit gebunden sind.  Paedagogen, die heute noch immer
bedingungslos an den Konventionen der Schriftkultur und der
Schriftlichkeit festhalten, als waeren sie die einzigen, die die
Lebensfaehigkeit und das Verstaendnis der Mitmenschen garantieren,
ignorieren Howard Gardners Theorie der multiplen Intelligenzen
(frueher nannten wir sie Faehigkeiten).  Nur wenige widersetzen sich
der Alleinherrschaft der Schriftkultur.  William Burroughs, der die
"Sprache als einen Virus aus dem Weltraum" bezeichnet hat, ist einer
von ihnen.  Eine solche Bezeichnung erscheint nicht ganz grundlos,
wenn wir uns die vielfaeltigen Formen des Sprachmissbrauchs vor Augen
halten.

Die amerikanische Erfahrung lehrt, welche sozialen, wirtschaftlichen
und kulturellen Folgen die Propagierung eines einzigen, auf
Schriftlichkeit gruendenden Modells der weiterfuehrenden Bildung mit
sich bringt.  Sie ist sehr kostenaufwendig.  Sie ueberdeckt
Unterschiede, statt sich mit ihnen auseinanderzusetzen oder sie zu
foerdern.  Sie weckt Erwartungen einer kulturellen Homogenitaet in
einem Umfeld, dessen Staerke die Heterogenitaet ist.  Damit aber
negiert dieses Bildungsmodell, das von seiner Attraktivitaet noch
immer nichts verloren zu haben scheint, eine der wesentlichen Quellen
der amerikanischen Dynamik und Vitalitaet--die Offenheit fuer
Alternativen, die sich historisch aus der Opposition zu Zentralismus
und Hierarchie als treibende Kraft der amerikanischen Geschichte
erwiesen hat.  Eine auf praktische Zwecke ausgerichtete Bildung und
die Vielfalt zahlreicher unterschiedlicher Bildungsformen, welche der
Vielfalt der menschlichen Erfahrung entsprechen, ist eine
amerikanische Entdeckung.  Der Unterschied zwischen einer Bildung um
der Bildung willen und einer Bildung, die sich an den pragmatischen
Erfordernissen der Wirklichkeit orientiert, markiert den Punkt, an
dem sich die Wege scheiden.

Auf der Suche nach neuen Werten oder in der Konfrontation mit
unvereinbaren Antworten auf draengende Fragen orientiert man sich gern
an einer im Rueckblick oft problemlos erscheinenden Vergangenheit.
Sodann fragt man sich, durch welche Merkmale diese scheinbar heile
Vergangenheit gekennzeichnet war.  So erklaert sich wohl auch heute
die Nostalgie, die sich zur Schriftkultur und den Bildungsidealen
einer vergangenen Zeit zuruecksehnt.  Und man schliesst die Augen vor
der Tatsache, dass Amerika diesem romantischen Bild von der
Vergangenheit nie entsprochen hat.  Im Sueden war diese Art von
Bildung niemals allgemein verbindlich.  Sklaven und arme Weisse waren
stets ausgeschlossen, Frauen zu dieser Art von Bildung nicht gerade
ermuntert.  Insgesamt hatte ein protestantisch gepraegtes
Weltverstaendnis die Bildungsthemen bestimmt.

Und waehrend man insgesamt dazu neigt, die Leistungen und
Errungenschaften jenseits von Bildung und Schriftkultur und die
dynamische Lebenskraft eines nicht-gebildeten Amerikas unbeachtet zu
lassen, verehrt man nach wie vor die vermeintlich wirklichen
Kulturnationen, ohne zur Kenntnis zu nehmen, dass in vielen von ihnen
die alten Werte und die als Vermittler dieser Werte fungierenden
Bildungstraditionen in Frage gestellt werden.  Der allgemeine
Pragmatismus, der bei der Geburt Amerikas Pate stand und Amerikas
Entwicklung seit jeher begleitet hat, galt indes immer als Wert, fuer
den zu kaempfen sich lohnt.  In Europa hingegen, wo die ueberwiegenden
Laender weiterfuehrende und universitaere Bildung nahezu kostenlos
ermoeglichen, ist die Zahl derer, die einen Universitaetsabschluss
vorweisen, staendig gestiegen.  In der Folge ueberfluten nun
Universitaetsabsolventen den Arbeitsmarkt und muessen entdecken, dass
sie auf dessen Erfordernisse nicht genuegend vorbereitet sind, schon
gar nicht auf die neuen Formen des Informationsaustausches, der sich
ueberall auf der Welt durchsetzt.  In Europa herrscht noch immer eine
weitgehende Trennung zwischen Universitaetsbildung und
Berufsausbildung.  Hier ist ein Universitaetsabschluss noch immer
Ausweis einer allgemeinen intellektuellen Faehigkeit, nicht einer
hochqualifizierten Berufsausbildung.  Damit setzen sich die
Universitaeten dem Vorwurf aus, Elfenbeintuerme zu sein, in denen die
Studenten auf das praktische Leben unzureichend vorbereitet werden.
Nicht zufaellig bezeichnet man in Deutschland die "klassischen
Bildungsfaecher" wie Literaturwissenschaft, Philosophie,
Musikwissenschaft und Religion als brotlose Kunst.

Beim Vergleich mit anderen Kulturen haben die Amerikaner gern zum
Konkurrenten Japan geblickt und die Forderung erhoben, das
amerikanische Bildungssystem dem japanischen anzugleichen.  Die
Kritiker uebersehen dabei, dass die hohe Produktionsrate in Japan
weniger etwas mit dem Bildungsstand zu tun hat, sondern vielmehr auf
die rigiden Erziehungsmethoden der dortigen Bildungseinrichtungen
zurueckzufuehren ist.  Grundlegende Verhaltensweisen wie Konformitaet,
Teamgeist, Hierarchiebewusstsein und ein fast schon heiliges
Traditionsbewusstsein sind wichtige Bestandteile dieser Bildung.  Um
unterschiedliche Arbeitsprozesse am Fliessband miteinander zu
verbinden oder bestimmte, von hochentwickelten Maschinen
vorfabrizierte Modulkomponenten zusammenzufuegen, bedarf es keiner
vertieften Bildung.  Viel wichtigere Voraussetzungen hierfuer sind ein
ausgepraegtes Pflichtbewusstsein und der Stolz auf eine gut verrichtete
Arbeit--Denkweisen, die in einem Klima sozialer Sicherheit und
Dauerhaftigkeit gedeihen.  Das japanische Wirtschafts- und
Bildungssystem hat keinen grossen Spielraum fuer Abweichungen oder die
Entwicklung neuer Modelle.  In dem prekaeren Versuch, ihre Identitaet
zu wahren und zugleich ihre wirtschaftliche Expansion voranzutreiben,
betrieben die Japaner die Doppelstrategie von Abschottung und
gleichzeitiger OEffnung.  Diese Strategie zeigt sich vor allem darin,
dass sie sich die in anderen Laendern ertragreichen Wirtschaftszweige
aneignen und dann in einen Wettbewerb eintreten, der die spezifisch
japanischen Eigenschaften (Qualitaetsarbeit, Durchhaltevermoegen,
Kollusion) um die angemessenen fremden Komponenten ergaenzt.  Fast die
gesamte Infrastruktur des Fernsehens, jedenfalls in der analogen Form,
ist japanisch.  Wuerde aus irgendeinem Grunde die Programmkomponente,
d. h. die Inhalte der ausgestrahlten Programme, wegfallen, waere die
gesamte wundervolle Ausruestung der Fernsehtechnologie mit einem
Schlage unbrauchbar.  Aus diesem Grunde ist Japan auch ueberhaupt
nicht an einem Paradigmenwechsel in der Fernsehtechnik, etwa dem
revolutionaeren Digitalfernsehen, interessiert, weil sich ein riesiger
Industriezweig, dessen Produkte in fast jedem Haushalt dieser Welt
praesent sind, voellig neu erfinden muesste.  Die das gebildete Japan
durchziehende Erwartung der Bestaendigkeit greift mithin von der
Tradition der Schriftkultur auf ein Medium der Schriftlosigkeit ueber.
Im amerikanischen Zusammenhang hingegen, in dem stabile
Verbindlichkeiten eine sehr viel geringere Rolle spielen, stellt das
Digitalfernsehen wie alle anderen Innovationen im Computerbereich
eine Herausforderung, nicht etwa eine Bedrohung der wirtschaftlichen
Infrastruktur dar.  Das ist kein zufaelliges Beispiel.  In ihm
zeichnet sich naemlich beispielhaft die Dynamik ab, die im UEbergang
von einer auf Schriftkultur und Bildung beruhenden Kultur zu einer
Kultur mit mehreren miteinander konkurrierenden Formen der
Schriftlichkeit und Bildung liegt.  Diese ergeben sich vornehmlich
aus den Veraenderungen, die aus relativ kleinen autarken und homogenen
Gemeinschaften eine einzige, global ausgerichtete, durch Fernsehen
und andere digitale Medien effizient verbundene Welt machen.  Als
Illiterati haben die Amerikaner immerhin die Medizin, die
Genforschung, die Entwicklung internationaler Netzwerke, interaktiver
Multimedien und virtueller Realitaeten revolutioniert und damit ihre
Innovations- und Erfindungskraft bewiesen.

Natuerlich ist es einfacher, Bildungsplaene zu entwerfen, die
unabhaengig von den pragmatischen Erfordernissen der Lebenswelt auf
Dauerhaftigkeit angelegt sind.  Eine optimale, auf die pragmatischen
Beduerfnisse der in hohem Masse vermittelten und durch Arbeitsteilung
und weltweite Verknuepfung gekennzeichneten Arbeitswelt ausgerichtete
Erziehung muss vor allem das Erlernen neuer kognitiver Faehigkeiten in
den Mittelpunkt stellen.  Die zentralisierte, nicht sequentielle,
nicht deterministische Erfahrung erfordert kognitive Faehigkeiten, die
sich von den Merkmalen einer allgemeinen Bildung und Schriftkultur
unterscheiden.  Frueher hatte man aufgrund seiner Schulausbildung noch
vor dem Schulabschluss einen Platz in der Arbeitswelt gefunden.  Heute
produzieren Schulen die merkwuerdige Version des allgemein gebildeten
Schuelers, der dann noch das College besuchen muss, das dadurch immer
mehr zu einer Berufsschule (wenn auch laengst nicht im erforderlichen
Ausmass) wird.  Die Universitaeten ihrerseits haben unter dem Alibi der
Chancengleichheit und in der ausschliesslichen Beschaeftigung mit sich
selbst der allgemeinen Erziehung und Bildung mehr Schaden zugefuegt
als Nutzen, indem sie den Buergern ihre Bildungsvorstellungen als die
einzig denkbaren zur Erreichung eines besseren Lebens aufoktroyiert
haben.  Das Ergebnis sind ueberfuellte Kurse, in denen passive
Studenten wie am Fliessband durch die Kurse geschleust werden.  Allein
das Wort Universitaet bezeichnet eine universelle Bildungsauffassung,
die sich im Mittelalter entwickelt hat und in den USA schon vor ueber
einem Jahrhundert ihre Gueltigkeit verlor.  Im Zeitalter einer
globalen Wirklichkeit und vieler nebeneinander gueltiger Paradigmen
ist die Universitaet keineswegs mehr universell, sondern in hohem Masse
spezialisiert.

Bei all diesen Veraenderungen hat Amerika, dessen Identitaet auf
Innovation und Selbstverantwortung gruendet, seine ureigene
Philosophie der Dezentralisierung und Hierarchiefreiheit offenbar
vergessen.  Bei der Dezentralisierung und Vernetzung der
Arbeitsplaetze, bei der Neustrukturierung von Unternehmen waren Firmen
aus der Computertechnologiebranche fuehrend.  Die meisten
Wirtschaftsvertreter, besonders jene in den etablierten grossen Firmen,
zeigen sich noch immer zurueckhaltend, wenn es darum geht, Methoden
des Matrixmanagements oder dezentralisierte Organisation und
Betriebsstrukturen einzufuehren.  Nach einer Welle der
Umstrukturierung und Verschlankung sehen sich die Praesidenten und
Vorstandsvorsitzenden (im uebrigen ganz aehnlich wie
Universitaetspraesidenten und Schuldirektoren) unveraendert als Koenige,
waehrend sich die Arbeiter, sofern sie nicht durch Maschinen ersetzt
wurden, in einem sklavenaehnlichen Zustand befinden.  Formen der
Dezentralisierung wie Heimarbeit oder andere Arbeits- und
Verantwortungsteilung, allesamt effizienzerhoehend, setzen sich nur
muehsam durch.  Doch die Verhaeltnisse aendern sich!  Wo immer es
Mechanismen gibt, die die Welt von ihren auf klassischer Bildung und
Schriftkultur basierenden Handlungsprinzipien hinfuehren in eine
Zukunft erhoehter Effizienz und voellig neuer Taetigkeiten, tragen sie
den Stempel der USA. Und ohne Zweifel sind alle diese Mechanismen
digitaler Natur.

Die Abwendung von den urspruenglichen pluralistischen Grundlagen der
amerikanischen Geschichte wirkt sich auch im politischen Bereich aus.
Ehedem hatte Amerika eine ansehnliche Zahl von politischen Parteien
aufzuweisen.  Heute ist das politische System mehr oder weniger auf
ein dualistisches Modell zweier miteinander wetteifernder Parteien
reduziert, in dem sich das politische System jenes Weltreichs
widerspiegelt, dem es urspruenglich angehoerte.  Andere europaeische und
zahlreiche afrikanische und asiatische Laender haben ein
Vielparteiensystem, in dem sich die Vielfalt der Meinungen
widerspiegelt und das entsprechend den Vorteil der Vielfalt nutzen
kann.  Solche Systeme bringen einen groesseren Prozentsatz der Buerger
zur Wahl als das Zweiparteiensystem in den Vereinigten Staaten.  Alle
vier Jahre fordern die Amerikaner bei den Wahlen ein breiteres
Parteienangebot, aber nur ein einziger Staat, Alaska, kann mit mehr
als zwei Parteien aufwarten; interessanterweise gehoert der Gouverneur
von Alaska weder der Republikanischen noch der Demokratischen Partei
an.

Die USA haben einen derartigen Bildungskomplex entwickelt, dass nahezu
alles als Bildung durchgeht--kulturelle Bildung, Computerbildung,
visuelle Bildung usw. unabhaengig davon, ob Bildung wirklich gefragt
ist oder nicht.  Bildung hat sich gewissermassen selbst spezialisiert.
Hinzu treten neue Bildungsformen, die sich von den Idealen und
Erwartungen der klassischen Bildung deutlich unterscheiden und sich
in solchen Bereichen der Lebenspraxis herausgebildet haben, in denen
Schreiben und Lesen nicht mehr erforderlich sind.  Die sich darin
abzeichnende Ausdrucksvielfalt und Bandbreite der
Kommunikationsmoeglichkeiten lassen die neuen Errungenschaften des
Menschen erkennen und oeffnen neue Wege fuer Kreativitaet und
Wirtschaftskraft.  Der Zustand der Sprache, besonders der Niedergang
der Schriftkultur, ist zugleich ein Symptom fuer diesen neuen
Entwicklungsprozess.  In ihm spiegelt sich keineswegs ein Versagen der
Landespolitik oder des politischen Willens.  Dieses
Entwicklungsstadium verraet lediglich einen neuen, sich staendig
weiterentwickelnden Geist, der sich nicht einer einzigen Bildungsform
unterwerfen laesst, welche zudem in mancherlei Hinsicht ihre
Nuetzlichkeit verloren hat.  Moeglicherweise hat Amerika erst mit
diesem neuen Stadium seine eigentliche Reife gefunden.  Nicht wenige
sehen in der Krise der Sprache die Krise des weissen Mannes (siehe
Gottfried Benn) oder doch zumindest der westlichen Kultur.

Ist also die USA das Sinnbild einer Kultur der Schriftlosigkeit, der
‘Illiteralitaet’?  Sie ist es zumindest in dem Masse, in dem sie eine
Alternative zu einer Welt darstellt, die ausschliesslich durch
traditionelle Bildung und Schriftkultur gekennzeichnet ist.  Als
Verkoerperung einer Kultur jenseits der Schriftkultur hat Amerika
gezeigt, wie verschiedene Bildungsformen nebeneinander bestehen und
sich gegenseitig ergaenzen koennen.  Wo immer die Grundprinzipien der
Anpassung, der Offenheit, der Erprobung und UEberpruefung neuer Modelle
und neuer pragmatisch ausgerichteter Institutionen verfolgt werden,
ist das Ergebnis eine erhoehte Effizienz.  Der Preis, den die Menschen
fuer diese erhoehte Effizienz bezahlen muessen, ist nicht gering:
Personalabbau, Arbeitsplatzwechsel und Entwurzelung, Arbeitslosigkeit,
ein Verlust des Gefuehls der Bestaendigkeit, nach dem sich letztlich
ein jeder sehnt.  Ebenso aufgegeben werden muss die Faehigkeit oder der
Anspruch, alle in einer bestimmten Situation relevanten Aspekte
ueberblicken und bedenken zu koennen--die politischen, oekologischen,
sozialen, legalen und religioesen.  Solche Aspekte gehen ueber das
unmittelbar Erfahrbare hinaus und setzen an Stelle des
spezialisierten, auf die eigentliche Aufgabe konzentrierten,
bisweilen aber auch kurzsichtigen und engstirnigen Blicks einen
breiten Blickwinkel voraus, den die alten Bildungs- und
Ausbildungsformen ermoeglichten.  Andererseits sieht es ganz so aus,
als haetten wir gar keine Alternative mehr.  Und im grossen und ganzen
wird sich vermutlich niemand zuruecksehnen nach einem Zustand, wie er
vor 2000 Jahren herrschte.
