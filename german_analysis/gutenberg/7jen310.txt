Project Gutenberg Etexts are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep etexts in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
or increase our production and reach our goals.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

We need your donations more than ever!

As of November, 2001, contributions are being solicited from people

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer 
to
donate.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm 
etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States 
copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this etext,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the etext,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word
     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.

Vorwort zur deutschen Ausgabe

Unsere Welt ist in Unordnung geraten.  Die Arbeitslosigkeit ist eine
grosse Belastung fuer alle.  Sozialleistungen werden weiter drastisch
gekuerzt.  Das Universitaetssystem befindet sich im Umbruch.  Politik,
Wirtschaft und Arbeitswelt durchlaufen Veraenderungen, die sich nicht
nach dem gewohnten ordentlichen Muster des sogenannten Fortschritts
richten.  Gleichwohl verfolgen Politiker aller Couleur politische
Programme, die mit den eigentlichen Problemen und Herausforderungen
in Deutschland (und in Europa) nicht das Geringste zu tun haben.  Das
vorliegende Buch moechte sich diesen Herausforderungen widmen, aus
einer Perspektive, die die Zwangslaeufigkeit dieser Entwicklung betont.

Wenn man eine Hypothese vorstellt, benoetigt man ein geeignetes
Prueffeld.  In meinen Augen ist Deutschland am besten dafuer geeignet.
In keinem anderen Land der Welt laesst sich die Dramatik des Umbruchs
so unmittelbar verfolgen wie hier.  In Deutschland treffen die Kraefte
und Werte, die zu den grossen historischen Errungenschaften und den
katastrophalen historischen Fehlleistungen dieses Landes gefuehrt
haben, mit den neuen Kraeften und Werten, die das Gesicht der Welt
veraendern, gewissermassen in Reinform zusammen.

An Ordnung, Disziplin und Fortschritt gewoehnt, beklagen die Buerger
heute eine allgegenwaertige laehmende Buerokratie, die von Regierung und
Verwaltung ausgeht.  Frueher galt das, verbunden mit dem Namen
Bismarcks, als gute deutsche Tugend, eine der vielen
Qualitaetsmaschinen „Made in Germany“.  Im Verlauf der Zeit aber wurde
der Buerger abhaengig von ihr und konnte sich nicht vorstellen, jemals
ohne sie auszukommen.  Die Mehrheit schreckt vor Alternativen zurueck
und moechte nicht einmal ueber sie nachdenken.  Gepraegt von Technik und
Qualitaetsarbeit ist die Vorstellung, dass das Industriezeitalter
seinem Ende entgegengeht, den meisten eine Schreckensvision.  Sie
wuerden eher ihre Schrebergaerten hergeben als die digitale Autobahn zu
akzeptieren, die doch die Staus auf ihren richtigen Autobahnen zu den
Hauptverkehrszeiten abbauen koennte--ich betone das „koennte“.  Noch
immer lebt es sich gut durch den Export eines technischen und
wissenschaftlichen Know-how, dessen Glanzzeit allerdings vorueber ist.

Als ein hochzivilisiertes Land ist Deutschland fest entschlossen, den
barbarischen Teil seiner Vergangenheit hinter sich zu lassen.  Der
Klarheit halber sei gesagt, was ich unter barbarisch verstehe:
Hitler-Deutschland verdient keinen anderen Namen, ebensowenig wie
alle anderen AEusserungen von Aggression, Antisemitismus und Rassismus,
die noch immer nicht der Vergangenheit angehoeren.  Aber bis heute hat
man nicht verstanden, dass eben jene pragmatische Struktur, die die
industrielle Kraft Deutschlands begruendete, auch die destruktiven
Kraefte beguenstigte.  (Man denke nur an die Technologieexporte, die
die wahnsinnigen Fuehrer oelreicher Laender erst juengst in die Haende
bekommen haben.) Das wiedervereinigte Deutschland ist bereit, in
einer Welt mit globalen Aufgaben und globalen Problemen Verantwortung
zu uebernehmen.  Es setzt sich unter anderem fuer den Schutz des
tropischen Regenwaldes ein und zahlt fuer Werte--den Schutz der
Umwelt--statt fuer Produkte.  Aber die politischen Fuehrer Deutschlands
und mit ihnen grosse Teile der Bevoelkerung haben noch nicht begriffen,
dass der Osten des Landes nicht unbedingt ein Duplikat des Westens
werden muss, damit beide Teile zusammenpassen.  Differenz, d. h.
Andersartigkeit, ist eine Qualitaet, die sich in Deutschland keiner
grossen Wertschaetzung erfreut.  Verlorene Chancen sind der Preis, den
Deutschland fuer diese preussische Tugend der Gleichmacherei bezahlen
muss.

Die englische Originalfassung dieses Buches wurde 1997 auf der
Leipziger Buchmesse vorgestellt und in der Folge von der Kritik
wohlwollend aufgenommen.  Dank der grosszuegigen Unterstuetzung durch
die Mittelsten-Scheid Stiftung Wuppertal und die Alfred und Claere
Pott Stiftung Essen, fuer die ich an dieser Stelle noch einmal Dank
sage, konnte dann Anfang 1998 die Realisierung des von Beginn an
bestehenden Plans einer deutschsprachigen Ausgabe konkret ins Auge
gefasst werden.  Und nachdem Prof. Dr. Norbert Greiner, bei dem ich
mich hier ebenfalls herzlich bedanken moechte, fuer die UEbersetzung
gewonnen war, konnte zuegig an die Erarbeitung einer gegenueber der
englischen Ausgabe deutlich komprimierten und staerker auf den
deutschsprachigen Diskussionskontext zugeschnittenen deutschen
Ausgabe gegangen werden.  Einige Kapitel der Originalausgabe sind in
der deutschsprachigen Edition entfallen, andere wurden stark
ueberarbeitet.  Entfallen sind vor allem solche Kapitel, die sich in
ihren inhaltlichen Bezuegen einem deutschen Leser nicht unmittelbar
erschliessen wuerden.  Ein Nachwort, das sich ausschliesslich an die
deutschen Leser wendet, wurde ergaenzt.

Die deutsche Fassung ist also eigentlich ein anderes Buch.  Wer das
Thema erweitern und vertiefen moechte, ist selbstverstaendich
eingeladen, auf die englische Version zurueckzugreifen, in die 15
Jahre intensiver Forschung, Beobachtung und Erfahrung mit der neuen
Technologie und der amerikanischen Kultur eingegangen sind.  Ein
Vorzug der kompakten deutschen Version liegt darin, dass die juengsten
Entwicklungen--die so schnell vergessen sein werden wie alle anderen
Tagesthemen--„Fortsetzungen“ meiner Argumente darstellen und sie
gewissermassen kommentieren.  Sie haben wenig miteinander zu tun und
sind dennoch in den folgenden Kapiteln antizipiert: Guildos Auftritt
beim Grand Prix d’Eurovision (liebt er uns eigentlich immer noch, und
warum ist das so wichtig?), die enttaeuschende Leistung der deutschen
Nationalmannschaft bei der Fussballweltmeisterschaft (standen sich im
Endspiel Brasilien und Frankreich oder Nike und Adidas gegenueber?),
die Asienkrise, das Ergebnis der Bundestagswahlen, der Euro, neue
Entwicklungen in Wissenschaft und Technologie, die juengsten
Arbeitslosenzahlen, die OEkosteuer und vieles mehr.  Wer sich der Muehe
einer gruendlichen Lektuere des vorliegenden Buches unterzieht, wird
sich auf diese Entwicklungen einen eigenen Reim machen koennen, sehr
viel besser als die Mediengurus, die uns das Denken abnehmen wollen.
Zumindest wird er ueber die wortreichen Artikel halbgebildeter
Akademiker und opportunistischer Journalisten schmunzeln, die allzeit
bereit sind, anderen zu erklaeren, was sie selbst nicht verstehen.

Wie in der englischen Version moechte ich auch meine deutschen Leser
einladen, mit mir in Kontakt zu treten und mir ihre kritischen
Kommentare oder Fragen per e-mail zukommen zu lassen: nadin@acm.org.
Im Einklang mit dem Ziel des Buches, fuer die Kommunikation jenseits

Kapitel 1:

Schriftkultur, Sprache und Markt

Maerkte sind vermittelnde Maschinen.  Heutzutage verstehen wir unter
Maschine allerdings etwas anderes als das, was das industrielle
Maschinenzeitalter darunter verstand--ein Zeitalter, das wir eng mit
dem pragmatischen Handlungsrahmen der Schriftkultur verbunden sehen.
Heute ruft der Begriff Maschine eher Assoziationen an Software, d. h.
Programme, weniger an Hardware, d. h.  Dinge, hervor.  Insgesamt
umfasst der Begriff Maschine jedoch Input und Output,
Verarbeitungsprozess, Kontrollmechanismen und vorhersagbare
Funktionsfaehigkeit.  Hier beginnen unsere Schwierigkeiten, und zwar
weil uns Maerkte bestenfalls als willkuerlich, planlos, alles andere
als programmiert erscheinen.  Marktvoraussage ist fast ein Oxymoron.
Was fuer eine Formel Fachleute auch ersinnen--der Markt geriert sich
vollkommen anders.

Eine unglaubliche Zahl von Transaktionen unterwirft die Produkte der
menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung staendig dem Test der Markteffizienz.
Nichts kann sich diesem Test entziehen: Ideen, Waren, Individuen,
Kunst, Sport, Unterhaltung.  Wie eine Kaulquappe scheint sich der
Markt selbst in seinen Transaktionen zu aendern.  Bisweilen erscheinen
diese uns so esoterisch, dass wir nicht einmal ahnen, was Input und
was Output in dieser Maschine ist.  Aber wir alle erwarten, dass sich
am Ende der haessliche Frosch in einen Maerchenprinzen verwandelt!

Ohne allzuviel vorwegzunehmen, koennen wir allerdings sagen, dass
dieser staendig wachsende Mechanismus menschlicher Selbstevaluierung
mit seiner gegenwaertigen Dynamik und im gegenwaertigen Umfang sich
nicht innerhalb des pragmatischen Rahmens der Schriftkultur haette
entwickeln koennen.  Gewiss koennen wir ueberall auf der Welt in Basaren
und Einkaufszentren Marktablaeufe erleben, die wir mit
vorausgegangenen pragmatischen Handlungsrahmen (etwa dem
Tauschhandel) in Verbindung bringen.  Als die wirklichen neuen
Marktformen in einer quasi reinen Form, also jene, die fuer ein
Erfahrungsstadium jenseits der Schriftkultur typisch sind, muss man
sich aber die Aktienboersen und die im Internet abgewickelten Formen
des Warentausches und der Auktionen vergegenwaertigen.  Man muss sich
jene unsichtbaren, weit verzweigten, im Netzwerk sich vollziehenden
Transaktionen vorstellen, bei denen kaum noch zu sagen ist, wer sie
in Gang gebracht, diese oder eine andere fortgefuehrt oder einen
Handel erfolgreich abgeschlossen hat, bzw. nach welchen Kriterien
sich dies vollzog.  Diese Transaktionen fuehren gleichsam ein
Eigenleben, haben eine Eigendynamik.

Der Begriff Vermittlungsmaschine konnotiert auch die Vorstellung von
einem Programm.  Manch ein Boersenmakler steht der Entwicklung, in der
viele Vermittlungen durch Entitaeten stattfinden, die weder sprechen
noch schreiben koennen, reserviert gegenueber.  Dennoch ist der
Boersenhandel mit Hilfe von Programmen heute eine
Selbstverstaendlichkeit.  Wirtschaftsexperten und Marktforscher, die
gemeinsam Software auf der Grundlage von biologischen Analogien, der
Genetik und dynamischen Systemmodellen entwickeln, belegen dies
nachdruecklich.


Vorbemerkungen

Wenn wir das Verhaeltnis zwischen Markt und Schriftkultur, bzw. einem
Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur, naeher betrachten, brauchen wir
zunaechst einen begrifflichen Rahmen, innerhalb dessen die spezifische
Rolle der Sprache als Vermittlungselement auf diesem Markt genauer zu
fassen ist.  Insbesondere muessen wir die Funktionen betrachten, die
die Schriftkultur bei der Diversifizierung von Maerkten und deren
Effizienzsteigerung erfuellt hat.  Wenn naemlich die Grenzen der
Vermittlungsfaehigkeiten der Schriftkultur erreicht sind, wird auch
ihre Effizienz in Frage gestellt.  Das geschieht nicht etwa ausserhalb
des Marktes, wie einige Wissenschaftler und Politiker uns glauben
machen wollen.  Diese Erkenntnis stellt sich auf dem Markt selbst ein,
auf dem im uebrigen auch geistige Arbeit einschliesslich der
Schriftkultur als Ware gehandelt wird.

Im folgenden sei Markt verstanden als ein Zeichenprozess, durch den
sich die Menschen in der Welt konstituieren.  Insofern koennen
Transaktionen auf dem Markt als Erweiterungen der menschlichen
biologischen Anlagen gesehen werden: Die Produkte unserer Arbeit
verkoerpern die strukturalen Merkmale unserer natuerlichen Anlagen und
genuegen den Beduerfnissen und Erwartungen, die diesen Merkmalen
entsprechen.  Diese Produkte sind Ausdruck unserer Persoenlichkeit und
unserer Kultur, sie ergeben sich aus den Erwartungen und Werten, die
fuer die menschliche Gattung charakteristisch sind, und lassen das
Selbstbewusstsein und die Zukunftsziele dieser Gattung erkennen.  Mit
der Sprache, mehr noch mit der Schriftkultur, werden Maerkte zu
Auslegungsinstanzen, projektive Instantierungen (d. h.
Materialisierungen) von uns selbst auf dem Weg zu einer neuen
Entwicklungsschwelle, einer neuen Skala.  Die Selbstkonstituierung
des Menschen durch Maerkte versinnbildlicht die erreichten Ebenen der
produktiven und kreativen Kraefte und die Ziele, die urspruenglich dem
UEberleben dienten, spaeter dem Wohlstand und nunmehr der Komplexitaet
einer globalen Skala gegenwaertiger und zukuenftiger Handlungsformen.

Von den fruehesten Formen des Tauschhandels bis zum heutigen Handel
mit Futures und Optionen, von der Geldwirtschaft zur bargeldlosen
Gesellschaft haben Maerkte seit jeher den Rahmen fuer eine immer hoehere
Handelseffizienz geschaffen, die oft genug gleichbedeutend mit Profit
ist.  Die allgemeinen Erklaerungen, zum Beispiel der Zeichencharakter
des Marktes, lassen dennoch einige spezifische Fragen offen: Wie
kommt es z. B., dass ein Geruecht ueber eine Firma deren Boersenwert
beeinflussen kann, waehrend veroeffentlichte Rechenschaftsberichte
nahezu unbeachtet und wirkungslos bleiben?  Es koennte sein, dass die
verborgenen Strukturen der im vorliegenden Buch diskutierten Ablaeufe
mehr zur Erklaerung und Vorhersage solcher Phaenomene beitragen koennen
als die vielfaeltigen mit akademischer Aura versehenen Theorien.


Products "R" Us

Wenn wir den Menschen als ein Zeichen setzendes Wesen (zoon
semeiotikon) verstehen, so will das besagen, dass der Mensch seine
individuelle Wirklichkeit in die Realitaet des allgemeinen Daseins
durch semiotische Mittel hineinprojiziert.  Auf dem Markt treffen die
drei Einheiten des Zeichenprozesses zusammen: das Darstellende
(Representamen), das, was dargestellt ist (Gegenstand) und der
Interpretationsvorgang (Interpretant).  Diese Begriffe koennen auch in
Bezug auf den Markt definiert werden.  Das Representamen ist das auf
dem Markt erkennbare Zeichenrepertoire.  Dabei kann es sich um
vielerlei Dinge handeln, um Nuetzlichkeit (eines bestimmten Produktes),
Seltenheit, Quantitaet, das zur Herstellung verwendete Material, die
fuer die Entwicklung und Hervorbringung eines Produktes aufgewendete
Phantasie oder die fuer den Herstellungsprozess verwendete Technologie
oder verbrauchte Energie.  Die Menschen koennen durch voellig
unerwartete Eigenschaften eines Produktes angezogen werden, koennen
geradezu eine Abhaengigkeit von Farbe, Form, Markennamen, Geruch usw.
entwickeln.  Manchmal ist das Representamen der Preis, der die an
einem Produkt beteiligten Elemente oder andere Preiskriterien wie
Verkaufstrend, die Attraktivitaet (sexiness) eines Produkts, die
Leichtglaeubigkeit oder die mangelnden wirtschaftlichen Kenntnisse von
Kaeufern benennt.  In jedem Fall repraesentiert der Preis das Produkt,
wenn auch nicht immer auf angemessene Weise.  Dem Gegenstand des
Zeichenprozesses entspricht das Produkt, sei es ein hergestellter
Gegenstand, ein Gedanke, eine Handlung, ein Ablauf oder ein Geschaeft.
Wenn wir einmal vom unmittelbaren Tauschhandel absehen, ist jeder
Marktgegenstand durch einige der oben aufgelisteten Eigenschaften
repraesentiert.  Dass diese Darstellungselemente keinen unmittelbar
einsichtigen Bezug zum Gegenstand haben muessen, zeigt nur, wie viele
Vermittlungseinheiten auf dem Markt wirksam sind.

Nichts ist ein Zeichen, solange es nicht als Zeichen interpretiert
wird.  Wir verstehen diesen Interpretanten als einen Ablauf, denn
Interpretationen koennen ad infinitum fortlaufen.  Ein Beispiel: Brot
ist ein Nahrungsmittel; ein akademischer Titel bezeugt die Tatsache,
dass ein Studium erfolgreich beendet wurde; Computer koennen als
verbesserte Schreibmaschinen oder fuer die Hervorbringung von Daten
verwendet werden.  Als Zeichen aber kann Brot fuer alles stehen, was
es verkoerpert: unser taegliches Brot; eine bestimmte Ernaehrungskultur;
das Wissen, das in den Getreideanbau und in die Getreideverarbeitung,
in die Hefeherstellung und in den Ofenbau, in die Kontrolle des
Backvorgangs eingeht.  Selbst symbolische, auf Mythos oder Religion
bezogene Interpretationen gehoeren zur Interpretation des Brotes als
Zeichen.  Ganz aehnlich verhaelt es sich mit akademischen Titeln, die
auf einen allgemeinen Bildungshintergrund, auf ein berufliches Umfeld,
auf eine Funktion und auf bestimmte Zukunftserwartungen hinweisen.
Und ganz aehnlich koennen Computer ueber ihre Funktionen hinaus auf die
Art der Anbindung an die Welt, auf die Art der Vernetzung, auf den
finanziellen Hintergrund seines Besitzers verweisen.

Aus der Voraussetzung, dass ein Zeichen nur durch Interpretation zu
einem solchen wird, ergibt sich, dass die Interpretation
gleichbedeutend ist mit der Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen als
Zeichen: Der Mensch wird re-praesentiert durch seine Produkte.  Die
Nuetzlichkeit wird einem Produkt abgelesen; ein Produkt kann auf
Wohlwollen oder Ablehnung treffen; es kann Beduerfnisse und
Erwartungen wecken.  Die sich selbst konstituierenden Individuen
erfahren durch ihr Handeln eine Selbstwertung (Erfolg oder Misserfolg),
die durch das Produkt (Ergebnis) ihrer Handlungsweise repraesentiert
wird; dabei kann es sich um ein greifbares oder immaterielles
Ergebnis handeln, einen konkreten Gegenstand, einen Ablauf (auch
Vermittlungsprozesse) oder einen Gedankenhandel.  Diese Lesarten
gehoeren ebenfalls zum Interpretationsvorgang.  Das Konglomerat aller
Lesarten ist das Portrait des abstrakten Konsumenten, der all
diejenigen verkoerpert, die ihre Individualitaet in den Transaktionen
konstituieren, die den Markt ausmachen.  Ein Gebrauchtwagenhaendler
oder ein Computerverkaeufer, ein Einzelhaendler oder ein
Universitaetsprofessor identifizieren sich jeweils auf ihre Weise im
Markt und durch den Markt.  Jeder wird durch einige charakteristische
Merkmale seiner Arbeit dargestellt.  Jeder wird auf dem Markt,
jeweils mit Blick auf den lebenspraktischen Zusammenhang der
Transaktion, als zuverlaessig, kompetent oder kreativ usw.
interpretiert.  Die Interpretationsformen des Marktes sind sehr
unterschiedlich; sie reichen von der einfachen Beobachtung des
Marktes bis zur unmittelbaren Eingebundenheit in die Marktmechanismen
durch Produkte, Warentausch oder Gesetzgebung.

Der Markt ist der Ort, an dem die drei Elemente des
Zeichenprozesses--das, was vermarktet wird (Gegenstand), die Sprache
oder Zeichensysteme der Vermarktung (Representamen), die
Interpretation (abgeschlossene oder nicht vollzogene
Transaktion)--zusammentreffen.  Der Markt kann unmittelbar oder
vermittelt sein, wirklich oder symbolisch, geschlossen oder offen,
frei oder reguliert.  Wochenmarkt, Supermarkt, Direktverkauf der
Hersteller oder eine Einkaufszeile sind Beispiele fuer reale Maerkte.
Der Markt gewinnt vermittelte oder symbolische Zuege in solchen Faellen,
wo das Produkt nicht unmittelbar in seiner dreidimensionalen
Realitaet dargeboten, sondern durch ein Bild, eine Beschreibung oder
ein Versprechen praesentiert wird.  Hierher gehoeren Versandhaeuser oder
Aktien- und Termingeschaefte, die allerdings aus den direkten, realen
Maerkten abgeleitet sind.  Frueher einmal war die Wall Street von
zahlreichen Maerkten umgeben: Sie boten vielfaeltige exotische Produkte
feil, die die Schiffe aus aller Welt herangetragen hatten.  Heute ist
die Wall Street ein System von Geraeten und Haendlern, die auf
Bestellzetteln oder Computerbildschirmen Zeichen entschluesseln, die
sich auf Handelsprodukte beziehen, von denen sie nichts verstehen.

Die Boerse ist heute ein Datenverarbeitungszentrum.  Nur so konnten
die Erwartungen an eine optimale Markteffizienz erfuellt werden.
Dennoch muessen die Zeichenprozesse dieses neuen Marktes in Echtzeit
stattfinden, die so real und notwendig ist wie die Zeit, die beim
Tauschhandel oder bei persoenlichen Verhandlungen ueber Produkte im
Spiel war.  Nur veraendert die neue Praxis des Marktes die Dauer von
Marktzyklen und die Geschwindigkeit geschaeftlicher Transaktionen.
Das Feilschen auf einem Basar erfordert Zeit, digitale Transaktionen
mit Hilfe von entsprechenden Programmen sind abgeschlossen, bevor
irgend jemand ihre Folgen kalkulieren kann.  Regulierungsmechanismen
koennen die Dynamik solcher Vermittlungsablaeufe beeinflussen.


Die Sprache des Marktes

Zeichen vermitteln zwischen dem auf dem Markt repraesentierten
Gegenstand und dem Interpretant bzw. dem Interpretationsvorgang--den
Menschen also, die sich im Interpretationsprozess, Beduerfniserfuellung
eingeschlossen, konstituieren.  Jeder Markt, gleich welchen Typus,
ist ein Vermittlungsraum.  Die Unterschiede zwischen den
verschiedenen Markttypen (Tauschhandel, Wochenmaerkte und
Lebensmittelmessen, stark regulierte Maerkte, sogenannte freie Maerkte,
Untergrundmaerkte) liegen nicht so sehr im Produkt oder im
Produktionsprozess, sondern im jeweiligen Vermittlungstypus.  Dabei
spielt die jeweilige dynamische Struktur des Marktes eine besondere
Rolle.

Gegenstaende (Sachen, Geld, Gedanken, Ablaeufe), die Sprache, in der
der Gegenstand ausgedrueckt wird, und die zum Abschluss oder Misserfolg
fuehrende Interpretation sind die drei strukturalen Invariablen, die
jedem soziooekonomischen Umfeld zu eigen sind.  Im sogenannten freien
Markt (der mehr ein abstrakter Begriff als eine Wirklichkeit ist) und
in strengen Formen der Planwirtschaft sind die Beziehungen zwischen
den drei Elementen variabel, nicht aber die Elemente selbst.  In
einem konkreten Zusammenhang kann der Interpretationsprozess
nachhaltig durch die Assoziationen zwischen einem Produkt und seinen
Darstellungsformen beeinflusst werden.

Zahlreiche Dokumente der Sprachgeschichte zeugen von den
Handelsbeziehungen des Menschen, von den einfachen bis zu den sehr
komplexen Formen.  Besitzverhaeltnisse und Besitzmerkmale werden
ebenso versprachlicht wie die Veraenderungen von Wechselkursen und des
sich durch die Marktablaeufe stets erweiternden Lebenshorizonts.  Aus
diesem Zusammenhang sind die ersten schriftlichen Dokumente
ueberliefert; sie unterstuetzen unsere These, dass die fuer eine
begrenzte Skala des Werteaustausches charakteristischen Marktablaeufe
die Wiege fuer Notation, Schrift und Schriftkultur darstellten.

Die enorme Komplexitaet der Marktmaschinerie ist durch eine Dynamik
gekennzeichnet, die ab einem bestimmten Entwicklungsstadium nicht
mehr durch die Gesetze und Erwartungen der Schriftkultur in den Griff
zu bekommen war.  Marktablaeufe unterliegen einer Form der
Selbstorganisation, die durch viele Parameter gesteuert wird; einige
von ihnen koennen wir kontrollieren, andere entziehen sich unserem
direkten Einfluss.  Zunehmend wird diese Dynamik von spezialisierten
Sondersprachen unterstuetzt, die den praktischen Kontext fuer neue
Typen der Transaktion liefern.  Netconomy war urspruenglich ein aus
net, network und economy zusammengesetztes Modewort.  In weniger als
einem Jahr setzte es sich als gelaeufiger Begriff fuer eine neue Form
des Marktes durch, der mit einer ausserordentlichen Effizienz immer
groessere Teile der Weltwirtschaft fuer sich vereinnahmte.  Die Folgen
dieser Netconomy wirken sich auch jeweils vor Ort aus.  Traditionelle
Distributionskanaele koennen sich eruebrigen, Wirtschaftszyklen werden
beschleunigt und Preise gesenkt.  In den virtuellen Geschaeften der
Netconomy werden heute schon Computer, Autos, Software und
juristische Dienstleistungen in grossem Umfang abgewickelt.

Wir wollen uns nun dem Marktprozess als Zeichenprozess in allen seinen
Aspekten zuwenden.  Indem die Menschen Waren darbieten, so hatten wir
gesagt, bieten sie sich selber dar.  Die verschiedenen Eigenschaften
des Produktes (Farbe, Geruch, Textur, Stil, Design usw.) wie auch die
Qualitaeten seiner Darbietung (Werbung, Verpackung, AEhnlichkeit zu
anderen Produkten) und damit zusammenhaengende Eigenschaften (Prestige,
Ideologie) gehoeren zu den Komponenten dieses Vorgangs.  Bisweilen
ist der Gegenstand an sich--ein neues Kleidungsstueck, Werkzeug, Haus,
Getraenk--weniger wichtig als das "Image", das er besitzt.  Sekundaere
Funktionen wie Schoenheit, Vergnuegen oder Anpassung ueberlagern die
primaere Funktion der Beduerfnisbefriedigung.  Im Zeichenprozess des
Marktes erweist sich eine derart motivierte Sehnsucht nach einem
Produkt als mindestens ebenso wichtig wie das tatsaechliche Beduerfnis.
In einem grossen Teil unserer Welt ist Selbstkonstituierung nicht
mehr laenger eine Frage des UEberlebenstriebs, sondern eine Frage des
Vergnuegens.  Je hoeher in einem Kontext des dekadenten UEberflusses die
semiotische Ebene des Marktes liegt, desto bedeutungsloser wird das
Marktgesetz der lebensnotwendigen Beduerfnisbefriedigung.

Die auf Lebenserhaltung abzielende menschliche Taetigkeit
unterscheidet sich erheblich von jenen Taetigkeiten, die zu einem
UEberschuss fuehren und dementsprechend fuer den Handel auf dem Markt zur
Disposition stehen.  UEberschuss und Tausch, die durch die
landwirtschaftliche Taetigkeit ermoeglicht wurden, hatten die Skala der
menschlichen Taetigkeiten erweitert und Zeichen, Zeichensysteme und
schliesslich Sprache erforderlich gemacht.  UEberschuesse koennen
vielfaeltig genutzt werden.  Hierfuer waren Zeichen und spaeter die
Differenzierungsformen der Sprache noetig.  Rituale, Schmuck, Krieg,
Religion, Akkumulationstechniken und Mittel der UEberredung sind
Beispiele fuer solche Ausdifferenzierungen.  Alle diese Verwendungen
sind charakteristisch fuer Interaktionsformen zwischen Menschen, die
sich als Siedler niedergelassen haben, und sie brachten Produkte
hervor, die mehr waren als materielle Konsumgueter.  Sie waren
allesamt Projektionen individueller Selbstkonstituierung.

Jedes Produkt geht aus einem Zyklus von Entwicklung, Herstellung,
Handel und dem daran geknuepften Verstaendnis von Nuetzlichkeit und
Dauerhaftigkeit hervor.  Als die rudimentaeren Formen von Schreiben
und Lesen, spaeter die hochentwickelten Formen der Schriftkultur am
Markt teilhatten, waren die Moeglichkeiten dafuer geschaffen, die ueber
die unmittelbaren Beduerfnisse der Lebenserhaltung hinausgehenden
Produkte so zu verwenden, dass weitere UEberschuesse erzeugt werden
konnten.  Der Markt der Handelsgueter, der Dienstleistungen, der
Sklaven und der Ideen wurde ergaenzt durch den Markt der bezahlten
Arbeitskraefte, die sich, wie die roemischen Soldaten, das Geld fuer
ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienten.  Diese neue Kategorie Mensch setzt
sich in einen pragmatischen Handlungsrahmen, in dem Produktion
(Arbeit) und die Produktionsmittel voneinander getrennt waren.  Eine
aehnliche Differenzierung vollzog sich mit der Sprache, mit der diese
Arbeiter sich konstituierten.  In dem Masse, in dem die Arbeit vom
letztendlichen Produkt der Arbeit entfremdet wurde, entstand auch
eine Sprache des Produktes.


Die Sprache der Produkte

Der ausschliesslich auf die Notwendigkeiten des Lebens bezogene
Warenaustausch entsprach einer Skala, die Zusammenhang und
Homogenitaet garantierte.  In dieser ueberschaubaren kleinen Welt
bedurfte es keiner Gebrauchsanweisungen fuer die im Tauschhandel
erworbenen Produkte.  Der langsame Rhythmus der Produktionszyklen
blieb auf den natuerlichen Lebensrhythmus bezogen.  Dieser begrenzte
Markt war Teil eines sozialen Mechanismus, der alle Individuen in die
gleiche begrenzte Erfahrung einband und sie an ihr teilhaftig werden
liess.

Die heutigen Maerkte sind durch sehr komplexe Vermittlungsmechanismen
gekennzeichnet und stellen daher kein Umfeld mehr fuer eine allen
Menschen gemeinsame Erfahrung dar.  Im Gegenteil sind die heutigen
Maerkte eher Rahmen, innerhalb derer verschiedene Formen menschlicher
Erfahrung in Konkurrenz zueinander treten.  Das bedarf noch einiger
Erlaeuterungen.  Produkte verkoerpern nicht nur Materialien, Design und
Fertigkeiten, sondern auch eine Sprache fuer ihre optimale
Funktionsfaehigkeit.  Insofern stellen sie auch eine Vielzahl von
Wegen dar, in denen sich die Menschen durch die Sprache dieser
Produkte konstituieren.  Der Markt wird so zu einem Umschlagsort fuer
die vielen Sprachen, die die Produkte sprechen.  Die heute erreichten
Effizienzebenen haben zu Erwartungen gefuehrt, die ihrerseits die
komplexen Myriaden dessen ermoeglichten, was heute produziert wird.
In diesem pragmatischen Rahmen spielt Schriftkultur und Alphabetismus
nur noch eine marginale Rolle.

Abgesehen von der Zurueckdraengung der Schriftkultur muessen wir
allerdings noch einen anderen Preis bezahlen: Weil jedes Produkt
nicht nur seine eigene Sprache beinhaltet, sondern auch seine eigenen
Wertkriterien, verzeichnen wir insgesamt einen Qualitaetsverlust.
Fast jedes Produkt ist nur noch eines unter vielen anderen, aus denen
wir auswaehlen; ein jedes traegt seine eigene Rechtfertigung in sich.
Der Wert wird dadurch relativiert, und oft genug liegt der Grund fuer
einen Kauf oder fuer die Suche nach etwas Neuem gar nicht im Wert des
Produkts.  Grammatikregeln, die uns eine Vorstellung von der Ordnung
und der Qualitaet des Schriftgebrauchs vermittelten, sind auf Produkte
nicht anwendbar.  Ebenso waren unsere Moralvorstellungen in die
Sprache eingebettet und durch Schrift und Bildung getragen.  Die
Moralvorstellungen, die in den partiellen Alphabetismen der
miteinander konkurrierenden Produkte verkoerpert sind, wollen den
Konsumenten nicht mehr als religioese oder ethische Prinzipien
erscheinen, sondern allenfalls als Rechtfertigung fuer politischen
Einfluss.  UEber bestimmte Regulierungen des Marktes bringt sich die
Politik als Selbstbedienungsfaktor in die Handelsbeziehungen ein.


Handel und Schriftkultur

Frueher haben die kleinen Geschaefte in unserer Nachbarschaft nicht nur
unseren taeglichen Bedarf abgedeckt, sondern waren gleichzeitig
Kommunikationszentren.  Ein Supermarkt muss sich an Lagerkapazitaeten
und optimaler Raumnutzung, an schnellem Warendurchgang und einer
relativ geringen Verdienstspanne am einzelnen Produkt orientieren:
Hier sind Kommunikation und Gespraech kontraproduktiv.  Versandhaeuser
und elektronische Bestellung haben das Gespraech voellig eruebrigt.  Sie
operieren jenseits von Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur und jenseits
von menschlicher Interaktion.  Die Handelsablaeufe sind auf ein
Minimum reduziert: Auswahl, Bestaetigung, Angabe der Kreditkarte oder
ihre automatische Erkennung und Bestaetigung durch einen
Netzwerkservice.

Die auf der Schriftkultur basierenden Handelsformen haben alle
Merkmale der geschriebenen Sprache und des Lesens erfordert, so weit
sie sich auf diese Transaktion bezogen.  Die Schriftkultur trug dazu
bei, dass die Beduerfnisse breiter ausgefaechert und die Wuensche genauer
artikuliert wurden, dementsprechend konnten sich die Maerkte
entwickeln und eine bis dahin nicht gekannte Effizienz erreichen.
Die dafuer noetige Ausbildung und das Verbot von Kinderarbeit
verkuerzten einerseits den produktiven Teil des menschlichen Lebens,
andererseits wurde dessen Effizienz durch die aus der Schriftkultur
hervorgehenden Lebensformen erhoeht.  Hoehere Produktivitaet und eine
breitere Nachfrage optimierten die Marktzyklen.  Seit der Zeit der
phoenizischen Kaufleute haben die Schrift und die aus ihr
hervorgehende Schriftkultur ihren Beitrag geleistet zu den Strategien
des Warentausches, zur Besteuerung--die direkteste Form des
politischen Eingriffs in den Markt--und zu den regulierenden
Eingriffen in die vielfaeltigen Formen, in denen sich die Menschen im
und durch den Markt konstituieren.  Schriftliche Vertraege weckten
Erwartungen bezueglich einer weitergehenden, allgemeineren Planung auf
der Grundlage der Schriftlichkeit.

Zwischen der Gewinnung und Verarbeitung von Rohmaterialien und dem
Verkauf und Konsum eines Produktes sind viele Ebenen geschaltet.  Auf
jeder Ebene ist eine andere Sprache wirksam, manchmal sehr konkret,
bisweilen sehr abstrakt.  Diese Sprachen sollen die
Verarbeitungsprozesse und Handelsablaeufe beschleunigen, die Risiken
reduzieren, den Profit erhoehen und die Effektivitaet weltweiter
Handelsbeziehungen sichern.  Ohne negativen Einfluss auf die Effizienz
der Vermittlung koennen diese neuen Handelsformen jedoch nicht mehr im
Zentralismus einer Schriftkultur befangen bleiben.  Die Ergebnisse
einer 70jaehrigen Planwirtschaft in der Sowjetunion und ihrer
Satellitenstaaten--allesamt hochgebildete Gesellschaften--ist hierfuer
ein sichtbarer Beweis.  Die Geschwindigkeit der heutigen
Handelsablaeufe und der parallele Verlauf der Verhandlungen erfordern
Sprachen von optimaler Funktionalitaet und minimaler Ambiguitaet.
Manche Transaktionen muessen auf visuelle Argumente zurueckgreifen, die
ueber die Moeglichkeiten der Telekonferenz weit hinausgehen.  Produkte
und Verfahren werden noch im Verlauf der Verhandlungen durch die
interaktive Verknuepfung aller am Design, an der Herstellung und an
der Vermarktung Beteiligten modifiziert.

Die UEberschreitung nationaler oder politischer (auch kultureller und
religioeser) Allianzen fuehrt zu einer neuen Form von Freiheit, die
allerdings auch Freiheit von der schriftkulturellen Form einer
Nationalsprache und von allen im schriftkulturellen Diskurs
beheimateten Darstellungen und Definitionen von Freiheit bedeutet.
Da Zeichensysteme und ganz besonders Sprachen keine neutralen
Ausdrucksmittel sind, muessen wir uns zunehmend auch in den Zeichen
anderer Kulturen zurechtfinden.  Heute gibt es schon
Unternehmensberatungen, die sich auf die Probleme der
Interkulturalitaet und die unterschiedlichen Kulturformen
verschiedener Laender spezialisieren.  Sie handeln mit dem, was Robert
Reich Symbolmanipulation genannt hat.  Deren Rat erstreckt sich auch
auf Bereiche und Sitten, die jenseits der in der Schriftkultur
festgehaltenen Werte liegen: also etwa auf die Frage, in welchen
Laendern Bestechung der effizienteste Weg zum geschaeftlichen Erfolg
ist.


Wessen Markt?  Wessen Freiheit?

Ein Markt, der an die moralischen und politischen Begriffe des
schriftkulturellen Diskurses gebunden bleibt, erreicht schnell die
Grenzen seiner Effizienz.  Wir begegnen diesen Grenzen auf andere
Weise, wenn wir in bestimmten gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhaengen mit
Idealen oder Verhandlungspositionen konfrontiert werden, deren
implizite Wertvorstellungen sich aus Erwartungen (bezueglich eines
bestimmten Lebensstandards oder irgend welcher Vorteile) ergeben, die
in Vertraegen und Gesetzen eingefroren sind.  Viele europaeische Laender
erleben derzeit die Krise ihres schriftkulturellen Erbes, weil
ueberholte, den neuen Effizienzerwartungen nicht mehr entsprechende
Arbeitsverhaeltnisse in Arbeitsgesetzen kodifiziert sind.

Andererseits muessen wir sehen, dass die in der amerikanischen
Verfassung garantierten Menschenrechte auf dem weltweiten Markt
gerade von denen vergessen werden, fuer die sie angeblich
selbstverstaendlich sind.  Kein Amerikaner--nicht einmal ein
Angehoeriger einer Minderheit--schert sich beim Kauf von neuen
Turnschuhen auch nur einen Deut darum, dass die Frauen und manchmal
sogar Kinder, die diese Turnschuhe in fernoestlichen Laendern
anfertigen, damit nicht einmal ihren Lebensunterhalt verdienen koennen.
Und diese unmoralische oder opportunistische Haltung koennen wir
nicht einmal dem Markt zuschreiben, sondern jenen Konsumenten, die
das Groesste und Beste zum kleinsten Preis erwarten.  Es ist fraglich,
ob Bildung und Schriftkultur wirksamer als die heutigen
Effizienzerwartungen jene Gerechtigkeit bewirken wuerden, die im
Elfenbeinturm der Literatur eingeklagt wird.  Wer an einen Markt, der
durch Wettbewerb gekennzeichnet ist und auf dem nur Effizienz und
Profit zaehlen, ethische Erwartungen herantraegt, wird schnell
enttaeuscht sein, wenngleich es vielleicht die Gewissensbisse lindern
mag.  Maerkte sind der Ausdruck derer, die sie konstituieren; sie sind
realistisch, wenn nicht sogar zynisch.

Allein aus Gruenden der Effizienz geben Maerkte die Rahmenbedingungen
fuer die Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen ab, der Freiheiten und
Rechte geniesst, die zu seinen produktiven Faehigkeiten beitragen.  Der
Gedanke, dass Maerkte nicht nur von grossen Spannungen gekennzeichnet
und ohne Moral, sondern auch die Wiege fuer Freiheit, Toleranz
(politische, soziale, religioese und geistige) und Kreativitaet sind,
wird nicht jedem gefallen.  Aber wir sollten nicht vergessen, dass die
amerikanische Revolution nicht zuletzt durch Handelsstreitigkeiten
hervorgerufen wurde.  Nach dem Zusammenbruch des Kommunismus in den
Sowjetlaendern setzen sich im ehemaligen Ostblock allmaehlich und
muehsam Formen des Waren- und Gedankenaustausches durch, die denen im
Westen ganz aehnlich sind.  Und trotz aller gegenwaertiger
Schwierigkeiten erkennen wir deutlich eine Entwicklung zu mehr
Freiheit und weniger Regulierungswut.  Lediglich die Volksrepublik
China ist noch im Griff einer zentralistisch geregelten
Planwirtschaft.  Und doch zeichnet sich auch dort ab, dass die
Konkurrenz zwischen offenen Maerkten und der freie Fluss von Guetern auf
ein klares zukuenftiges Ziel hinsteuert.  Es wird vielleicht noch
etwas dauern, aber dann werden auch die Chinesen auf dem Festland so
frei sein wie ihre Nachbarn in Taiwan.  Letztlich entscheidet die
Interaktion auf dem Markt das Schicksal der Menschen.

Und der Markt wird die Schriftkultur hinter sich lassen, wenn diese
seine Effizienz beeintraechtigt; er wird sich mit Hilfe von
Mechanismen weiterentwickeln, die den neuen Bedingungen des neuen
Marktes angemessen sind.  Wenn wir verstehen wollen, wie Maerkte
funktionieren, hat es ueberhaupt keinen Sinn mehr, auf Erklaerungen
zurueckzugreifen, die aus ueberholten Formen der Lebenspraxis
entwikkelt wurden.  Es waere Zeitverschwendung und wuerde in Nostalgie
enden.  Die neue komplexe Lebenspraxis des neuen Marktes und damit
die neuen Moeglichkeiten unserer Selbstkonstituierung wuerden wir
dadurch nicht besser beherrschen.


Neue Maerkte, Neue Sprachen

Unser Beschreibungsmodell, das den Markt als Zeichenprozess definiert,
machte den offenen Charakter jeder Transaktion sichtbar; unsere
Eroerterung der zahlreichen Phasen, in denen sich die Konstitution von
Maerkten vollzieht, hat die distributive Natur von Marktprozessen
dargelegt.  Um die veraenderten Bedingungen der menschlichen
Selbstkonstituierung auf dem Markt in einer radikal veraenderten Skala
mit einer entsprechend neuen Dynamik naeher zu erklaeren, muessen wir zu
beiden Bereichen einige Ergaenzungen machen.

Die Verwendung von Zeichen und von Sprache ist eine spezifisch
menschliche Taetigkeit.  Die Verfasser eines gesprochenen oder
geschriebenen Textes konstituieren damit ihre Identitaet und richten
sich gleichzeitig darauf ein, die Antwort einer potentiellen oder
intendierten Leserschaft entgegenzunehmen und zu interpretieren.
Dieses gilt fuer alle zeichenhaften Ausdrucksformen und ihre
Kombinationen.  Text, Musik, Geruch koennen Bilder assoziieren oder
auch Assoziationen untereinander hervorrufen.  Diese Assoziation kann
weitervermittelt werden an andere, die sie wiederum ad infinitum
verbreiten, und zwar oft so, dass das Ausgangszeichen (d. h. also die
Ausgangsperson, die ein Zeichen in Antizipation der durch andere
vollzogenen Interpretation des Zeichens entwirft) am Ausgangspunkt
dieses UEbermittlungsprozesses vollkommen vergessen ist.

Wenn wir nun diesen Gedanken auf die Produkte menschlicher Taetigkeit
uebertragen, koennen wir die Hervorbringungen des Menschen unter drei
Gesichtspunkten betrachten:
1. unter ihrer Ausdrucksleistung--etwa das von einer Maschine, einem
Produkt, einem bestimmten Nahrungs- oder Kleidungsmittel, einem
Wirtschaftszweig erfuellte Beduerfnis;
2. der Kommunikationsleistung--erfuellt das Produkt ein Beduerfnis
weniger oder vieler, auf welche Weise wird das Beduerfnis erfuellt, was
wird ausgesagt ueber die, die dieses Produkt hergestellt haben, und
die, die ihre Identitaet durch die Verwendung dieses Produktes setzen,
was erfahren wir ueber realisierte Chancen und eingegangene Risiken;
und
3. der Bedeutungsleistung--der in dem Produkt ausgedrueckte Wissens-
und Kompetenzstandard.
Das heisst natuerlich nicht, dass jedes Alltagsprodukt ein Zeichen oder
eine Sprache ist.  Aber es kann als Zeichen fuer einen Gegenstand (der
Produktionsstand in einem bestimmten Bereich, die Qualitaet des
Designs, die Kompetenz in der Ausfuehrung) interpretiert werden und
damit etwas aussagen ueber den pragmatischen Lebenszusammenhang des
Menschen und seine durch diese Pragmatik ermoeglichte
Identitaetsfindung.  Wir alle kennen Faelle, in denen dem Sprecher das
Wort auf den Lippen erstirbt, weil ihm niemand zuhoert.  Analog hierzu
kann auch ein Produkt aus unserem Leben verschwinden, weil es fuer
unsere Lebenspraxis irrelevant geworden ist.  Es gibt viele solcher
Faelle, in denen Zeichen diese Qualitaet der Interpretierbarkeit
verloren haben.

Eine Firma, die an die Boerse geht, wird an zahlreichen Eigenschaften
gemessen.  Das Wachstumspotential ist eine dieser Eigenschaften,
deshalb werden z. B. die im Internetbereich taetigen Firmen bei ihrem
Gang an die Boerse so hoch bewertet.  Dieses Potential kann in
schriftlicher Form dargelegt werden mittels veroeffentlichter Daten
ueber die erworbenen Patente, mittels Marktanalysen oder aber ueber die
intuitive Einsicht, dass sich in diesem Marktzeichen mehr verbirgt als
nur der Name und der anfaengliche Boersenwert.  In einer begrenzten
Skala der menschlichen Erfahrung konnte ein jeder an der Erfahrung
teilhaben; mit der Erweiterung der Skala hat die Schriftkultur die
Informationen uebermittelt und so die Rolle eines partiellen
Garantietraegers uebernommen.  Heutzutage gibt es nicht nur ein
Unternehmen fuer ein bestimmtes Produkt und eine Handlung, sondern
viele aehnliche und immer neue erhoehen den Konkurrenzdruck; Angebot
und Nachfrage regeln sich auf einem Markt, auf dem der Verlust des
einen der Gewinn des anderen ist.  Die Schriftkultur kann nicht
laenger als Hintergrund fuer die Dynamik dieser Veraenderung und
Erneuerung dienen.  Wuerde sie sich fuer die Kontrolle derartiger
Marktablaeufe eignen, haette sich die Firma Netscape--ein Synonym
schlechthin fuer den Internet-Browser--niemals so entwickeln koennen;
AEhnliches gilt fuer die Unternehmen, die die Software fuer das
Telefonieren via Internet (voice over ISP) entwickelt haben.

Bei einem relativ homogenen Markt erwies sich die Sprache als ein
angemessenes Kommunikationsmittel.  Solange die verschiedenen
Kontexte, die gemeinsam den heutigen Weltmarkt ausmachen, sich nicht
so erheblich unterschieden, wie es sich derzeit abzeichnet, waren
Schriftsprache und Schriftkultur ein gut funktionierender Kompromiss.
Aber nicht nur die Maerkte, sondern auch die Handelsformen selbst
haben sich veraendert: vom Austausch von Guetern gegen Gueter oder vom
Austausch von Guetern gegen einen universellen Ersatz (Gold, Silber,
Edelsteine) oder gegen konventionelle (Geld-) Einheiten hin zu Groessen
wie den Euro oder das ueber die Netzwerke gehandelte e-Money; in
diesem Entwicklungsschritt wird die eine allein gueltige Schriftkultur
durch eine Vielzahl von Alphabetismen und "Literalitaeten" ersetzt,
die an die einzelnen Transaktionssegmente gebunden sind.
Aktienanteile an einer italienischen oder spanischen Firma,
Warentermingeschaefte oder Obligationen fuer Investmentfonds der
Dritten Welt--sie alle unterliegen ihren eigenen Handelsgesetzen mit
einer jeweils eigenen Sprache.

Die Spezialisierung, die zur Effizienzsteigerung des Marktes fuehrte,
hat auch die Zahl von Sondersprachen und neuen Bildungsformen erhoeht.
Diese bringen das Produktionspotential von Unternehmen und den Wert
ihres Managements auf den Markt.  Sie verzeichnen z. B. die Hoehe der
erwarteten landwirtschaftlichen Produktivitaet (einschliesslich des
Risikos der Wetterbedingungen) und die im Zusammenhang der
fortschreitenden wirtschaftlichen Globalisierung sich abzeichnenden
unternehmerischen Risiken.  Sie koennen ihrerseits wiederum in
Programme eingebracht werden, die mit anderen Programmen in Beziehung
treten.  Darueber hinaus binden die Mechanismen, die fuer den
distributiven Charakter des heutigen globalen Marktes verantwortlich
sind, weitere Sprachen in den Markt ein, in diesem Fall die Sprachen
der "weichen" Maschinen, die unabhaengig von Schriftkultur mit
Faehigkeiten zur Informationssuche und heuristischen Planung
ausgestattet sind.

Marktsimulationen ermoeglichen die Erstellung von intelligenten
Programmen fuer die Abwicklung des Handels und die Entwicklung
zahlreicher selbstaendiger intelligenter Agenten, die sich selbst
modifizieren, auf neue Bedingungen einstellen und so immer bessere
Handelsergebnisse erzielen koennen.  Kurz: Vor dem Hintergrund eines
starken integrativen Prozesses spielen sich viele Vermittlungsformen
ab.  Dieser Hintergrund ist eben jener neue pragmatische Rahmen, der
die globale Plattform fuer eine in viele Teilbereiche aufgegliederte
Wirtschaft mit immer kuerzeren Produktionszyklen abgibt.  Der Prozess
kennt kaum noch sequentielle Ablaeufe und keinen Zentralismus.  Mit
anderen Worten: Nahezu die gesamte Marktaktivitaet vollzieht sich in
parallel ablaufenden verteilten Prozessen.  Darueber hinaus ergeben
sich in den fliessenden Koordinaten der weltweiten Handelsbeziehungen
neue Konfigurationen, d. h. sich veraendernde Interessenszentren.
Jedes einzelne Geschaeft entwickelt als ein sich selbst
organisierender Nukleus seine eigene Dynamik.  Auch die Beziehungen
zwischen solchen Konfigurationsnuklei sind dynamisch.  Die
Beziehungen zwischen den daran beteiligten Elementen sind nicht
linear und veraendern sich kontinuierlich.  Solidaritaet wird durch
Wettbewerb ersetzt, der nicht selten feindlich ist oder Formen der
Feindlichkeit annimmt.  So verzehrt der Markt sich selbst und damit
auch das Erbe der Schriftkultur, an deren Stelle er provisorische und
fuer spezielle programmierbare Funktionen eingerichtete
Spezialsprachen setzt.

Wann immer Individuen ihre Identitaet in ein Produkt hineinprojizieren,
wird die in diesem Produkt verkoerperte vieldimensionale Erfahrung
zum Tausch mit anderen dargeboten.  Auf dem Markt wird die Erfahrung
auf diejenige Dimension reduziert, die dem gegebenen Kontext der
Transaktion entspricht.  Mit seinem Verhalten auf dem Markt drueckt
der Mensch das Bewusstsein seiner selbst aus, seine kritischen und
selbstkritischen Faehigkeiten und seine Gerichtetheit auf die Zukunft.
Die abstrakte Natur der Marktprozesse, die Befreiung von der
Schriftkultur und die UEberantwortung an Technologien, die einen
effizienten Austausch ermoeglichen, verweisen auf eine Zukunft, die
manchen, die in anderen pragmatischen Zusammenhaengen aufgewachsen
sind, besorgniserregend erscheinen mag.

Die sozialistischen Modelle, deren ideologische Saeulen Begriffe wie
buergerlicher Besitz, Klassenunterschied, Reproduktion der
Arbeitskraft und aehnliche Kategorien waren und die aus einem
pragmatischen Rahmen hervorgingen, der die Schriftkultur moeglich und
notwendig gemacht hatte, haben sich eruebrigt.  Besitz und Maerkte sind
verteilt (nicht immer in einer Weise, die unserem Verstaendnis von
Fairness entspricht).  Wir definieren uns zunehmend in einem
gesellschaftlichen Kontinuum, das in mancherlei Hinsicht keinen Platz
mehr fuer das Aussergewoehnliche hat und an dessen Stelle das
Durchschnittliche und Mediokre setzt.  Die selbstkonstitutive Kraft
des Menschen wird nicht nur in den neuen Formen der Lebenspraxis
reproduziert, sondern multipliziert in einer Lebenspraxis des
UEberschusses, der neuen UEberschuss produziert.  Damit verliert der
Mensch seinen Sinn fuer Dauerhaftigkeit und fuer das Aussergewoehnliche
als Merkmale seiner Produkte und seiner Selbstkonstituierung durch
Arbeit.


Alphabetismus und das Transiente

Wenn ein Produkt mit einer lebenslangen Garantie auf den Markt kommt
und der Hersteller wenige Monate nach dem Verkauf des Produktes
bankrott geht, stellen sich normalerweise Fragen nach dem korrekten
Verhalten des Herstellers, nach falschen Angaben ueber das Produkt und
nach der Qualitaet der Werbung.  Solche Vorgaenge, gegen die niemand
immun ist, koennen nicht einfach abgetan werden, denn das Agieren auf
dem Markt bedeutet immer einen Umgang mit menschlichen Werten, wie
relativ diese auch sein moegen.  Ehrenhaftigkeit, Wahrheit und eine
Achtung vor dem gegebenen Wort gehoeren zur Schriftkultur und sind
entsprechend in den Buechern dieser Schriftkultur ausgedrueckt.  Diese
und alle anderen Buecher verlieren ihren Sinn, wenn wir die
Schriftkultur hinter uns gelassen haben.  Das heisst allerdings nicht,
dass in einem Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur alle Werte
korrumpiert und bedeutungsleer werden.  Maerkte leisten etwas anderes:
Sie bauen die Erwartungen der Menschen in ihre eigenen Mechanismen
ein.  Das heisst, sie muessen nicht deshalb bestimmte menschliche
Erwartungen erfuellen, weil diese schriftlich niedergelegt sind,
sondern weil die Maerkte anders nicht erfolgreich funktionieren wuerden.
Wie dies im einzelnen geschieht, bedarf einer ausfuehrlicheren
Eroerterungen.  Wir wollen dabei mit der eingangs gestellten Frage
beginnen: Was geschieht mit der lebenslangen Produktgarantie, wenn
der Hersteller bankrott geht?

Wir haben bereits in verschiedenen Zusammenhaengen gesehen, dass die
sich in der Schriftkultur vollziehende sprachliche
Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen Stabilitaet und progressives
Wachstum insinuiert.  Die in dieser Lebenspraxis gefundenen
Produktionsmittel weisen ebenfalls Eigenschaften auf, die
Dauerhaftigkeit garantieren.  So erscheint das industrielle Modell
als Erweiterung des in der Schriftkultur verwurzelten
Schoepfungsmodells.  Maschinen waren leistungsstark und beherrschend.
Sie und ihre Produkte ueberdauerten die Generation derer, die sie
entwickelten und verwendeten.

Schriftkultur und Bildung waren an den komplexen Lebensumstaenden
beteiligt, die zur industriellen Revolution fuehrten, und sie wurden
durch diese dann weiter gefoerdert und unterstuetzt.  Elektrisches
Licht verlaengerte die Zeitraeume, die zum Lesen zur Verfuegung standen.
Buecher konnten schneller und billiger gedruckt werden, weil das
Papier schneller und billiger hergestellt und die Druckmaschinen
durch staerkere Motoren angetrieben wurden.  Somit stand auch mehr
Zeit fuer Ausbildung und Studium zur Verfuegung; die industrielle
Gesellschaft erkannte, dass mit der Entwicklung komplizierterer
Maschinen qualifizierte Arbeitskraefte produktiver waren.  All dies
vollzog sich vor einem Erwartungshorizont, der wesentlich durch
Dauerhaftigkeit gekennzeichnet war und sich auch auf die Struktur der
Maerkte auswirkte.  Im Gegensatz zu landwirtschaftlichen Produkten,
die den Einfluessen von Wetter und Zeit ausgesetzt sind, koennen
industrielle Produkte auf Kommission bestellt und gelagert werden.
In diesen heterogenen und vermehrt auf Kredit kalkulierten
Marktstrukturen war die Schriftkultur ein wesentliches
Vermittlungsinstrument.  Produktionszyklen waren lang und folgten
aufeinander wie die Jahreszeiten, wie die Buchstaben in einem Wort.
Ein grosser Hersteller verkoerperte mit seinen Produkten geradezu
Dauerhaftigkeit.  Eine lebenslange Garantie auf solche Produkte
beinhaltet eine Aussage ueber seine auf Dauer angelegte
Leistungsfaehigkeit und versinnbildlicht in gewisser Weise die Sprache,
die die Leistungsfaehigkeit des Produktes beschreibt.

Jenseits der Schriftkultur gelten diese Verhaeltnisse nicht mehr.
Weder das Design eines Produkts, noch die verwendeten Materialien und
angewandten Prinzipien sind darauf ausgelegt, ueber einen Zyklus
optimaler Effizienz hinaus zu funktionieren.  Das ist weder eine
moralische Entscheidung noch ein abwegiger Plan.  In unseren
Produkten druecken sich lediglich andere Erwartungen aus.  Ihre
Lebensdauer entspricht der Dynamik des Wandels, der neuen Skala
menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung und der fuer diese Skala typischen
Effizienzbesessenheit.  Unsere Produkte werden fluechtiger, weil die
relativ gleichfoermigen Zyklen unserer Selbstkonstituierung kuerzer
geworden sind.

Die Lebenserwartung ist gestiegen, und diejenigen, die den Hoehepunkt
ihrer produktiven Kraft ueberschritten haben, werden wohl bald die
Mehrheit der Bevoelkerung ausmachen.  Durch diese Veraenderung wird die
durch die neuen Vermittlungsstrategien erreichte hohe
Produktivitaetsebene nicht beeintraechtigt.  Ein laengeres Leben heisst
heute lediglich, dass man in mehrere Zyklen der Veraenderung
eingebunden ist (was allerdings andere Veraenderungen, etwa im Bereich
von Bildung und Ausbildung und im Familienleben, mit einschliesst).
Im Vergleich zu den vorangegangenen Jahrhunderten, in denen sich die
Entwicklung langsam vollzog, bezeugt eine abrupte Veraenderung
ihrerseits eine neue conditio humana.

Wo frueher Bildung und Schriftkultur fuer die Koordination der
vielfaeltigen Beitraege des Menschen zur Lebenspraxis noetig waren,
stehen heute neue Formen der Koordination und Integration.  Die ihnen
entsprechende Lebenspraxis ist durch Intensitaet und Verteilung
gekennzeichnet, und die Produkte tragen anstelle des Prinzips der
Dauerhaftigkeit das Prinzip der Veraenderung in sich, das alle
menschliche Erfahrung beherrscht.  Auf diese Weise machten sich
Marktbedingungen fuer das Fluechtige, Voruebergehende geltend.  Wenn ein
lebenslanges Funktionieren von Produkten garantiert wird, dann wird
unter lebenslang der relativ kurze Zyklus des gesamten Sortiments
verstanden.  Und auch die Moeglichkeit, dass ein Hersteller bankrott
geht, kommt nicht ueberraschend, denn die strukturellen Merkmale
unserer Effizienzerwartungen fuehren zu Produktionseinheiten, deren
Dauer (oder Kuerze) sich nach der Bedarfsdauer ihrer Produkte richtet.
Auf diese Weise werden also unsere Erwartungen in die
Marktmechanismen integriert.  Diese Produkte werden durch viele
Alphabetismen vermittelt, die dem Produkt innewohnen.  Nun wird auch
klar, warum wir auf eine lebenslange Produktgarantie verzichten
koennen: Wir entsorgen nicht nur die hergestellten Produkte, sondern
auch die in ihnen verkoerperte Sprache (bzw.  Sprachen).  Jede
Transaktion auf dem Markt des Fluechtigen entspricht einer
Lebenspraxis, die das faustische Prinzip in einen Werbeslogan
verwandelt.


Markt, Werbung, Schriftlichkeit

Die Rolle der Werbung in Markt und Gesellschaft ist durchaus
umstritten.  Die Meinungen reichen von Robert L. Heilbroners Urteil,
dass die Werbung die Moral der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft am
nachhaltigsten untergrabe, bis zu McLuhans Apologie, dass die Werbung
unserer Zeit unsere Werte, Sehnsuechte und Taetigkeiten am besten
widerspiegele.  Wir wollen nicht Partei ergreifen.  Ob wir nun
Werbung bewundern oder verachten, ignorieren oder geniessen, sie
spielt in unserem heutigen Leben eine enorm wichtige Rolle.  Wer aber
mit der Geschichte der Werbung einigermassen vertraut ist, wird wissen,
dass sich die Skala dieses Taetigkeitsbereichs als Bestandteil des
Marktes radikal veraendert hat.  Uns interessiert an der Werbung nicht
nur, wieviel Bildung und Schriftkultur (oder nicht-schriftkulturelle,
‘analphabetische’ Elemente) in ihr stecken, sondern auch, wie sich
die Mittel der Schriftkultur fuer die psychologischen, ethischen und
rationalen (oder irrationalen) Aspekte der Handelsablaeufe auf dem
Markt eignen.

Im uebrigen zeigt uns ein Blick auf die Werbung der vergangenen
Jahrhunderte, welche Rolle die Schriftkultur in der Gesellschaft und
in der kaufmaennischen Welt gespielt hat.  Mund-zu-Mund-Werbung und
Angebotstafeln vor einem Geschaeft stehen fuer eine Zeit, in der
Handelsablaeufe von geringem Umfang und mit geringer Reichweite an der
Tagesordnung waren.  Die Werbestrategien um die Jahrhundertwende
verdeutlichen ihrerseits die damals erreichten Standards der
Schriftkultur und die Effizienzerwartungen, die man bezueglich der
Handelszusammenhaenge und der Skala jener Zeit an sie richtete.  Die
Werbung jener Zeit enthaelt mehr Text als Bild und spricht mehr den
Verstand als die Sinne an.  Als Zeitungen und Wochenmagazine die
bestimmenden Kommunikationsmittel waren, verliess man sich in der
Werbung auf die UEberredungskraft des Wortes.  Nicht wirkliche
Ehrenhaftigkeit oder Werte wurden in ihnen ausgedrueckt, sondern nur
der Anschein davon.  Das schwarz auf weiss zu Papier gebrachte Wort
musste einfach und wahrhaftig erscheinen.

Das jedenfalls galt fuer Amerika.  In Europa hatte die Werbung zu
jener Zeit einen anderen Stil entwickelt, verriet aber noch immer das
Vertrauen in die alten Werte.  Viele bekannte Kuenstler wurden fuer die
Werbung gewonnen.  Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, El Lissitzky und Herbert
Bayer sind die bekanntesten.  Fuer den gebildeten und auf
Schriftkultur fixierten, aber kuenstlerisch interessierten Europaeer
jener Zeit besassen solche Werbungen fuer hochwertige Produkte und
Ereignisse eine groessere Suggestionskraft.  Vermutlich in der
Nachfolge dieser europaeischen Tradition experimentierten dann auch
amerikanische Designer nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg mit dem Bild als
Werbetraeger und schufen die Wiege fuer das Graphik-Design in den USA.
Als dann noch leistungsfaehigere Visualisierungsmedien zur Hand waren,
die zur Erhoehung ihrer Effektivitaet auf psychologische Daten
zurueckgreifen konnten, wurde das Bild in der Werbung zum
beherrschenden Faktor.  So offen und mehrdeutig ein Bild auch sein
mag, steigende Verkaufszahlen bestaetigten allemal die Wirkmaechtigkeit
des Bildes in der Werbung.  Sofern heute auf Schrift in der Werbung
zurueckgegriffen wird, geschieht es im wesentlichen mit Blick auf die
visuellen Aspekte der Schrift.

Auf den Maerkten herrscht alles andere als ein einfacher, klarer
Kausalzusammenhang.  Der UEbergang von einer wohl strukturierten,
rationalen Interpretation des Marktes und von seinem ethischen
Gebaren zu Irrationalitaet und Entstellung ist leicht vollzogen und
laesst sich an den neuen Formen ablesen, die die Maerkte genommen haben,
und an den neuen Techniken ihrer Transaktion und der damit
verbundenen Werbung.  Mit Irrationalitaet meinen wir die Aufgabe
allgemeiner Vernunftregeln (oder oekonomischer Theorien) bezueglich des
Warentausches.  In den 80er Jahren zeigte sich dies auf dem OElmarkt,
dem Kunstmarkt, dem Markt fuer Adoptivkinder und bei den Angeboten
neuer Werte auf dem Aktienmarkt.

Wirtschaftstheorien oder der Text einer Werbung koennen diese
Irrationalitaet nur anerkennen und Erklaerungen vorschlagen.  Es gibt
Ansaetze und Schulmeinungen im Bereich der Marktanalyse, die auf
Spieltheorie, Psychodrama, zyklischer Modellierung, den Mondphasen
usw. beruhen.  Sie alle produzieren eine Unmenge von
Informationsbroschueren, die die schwer vorhersagbaren
wirtschaftlichen und finanziellen Phaenomene zu erklaeren und zu
verstehen suchen.  Sprachaehnliche Erklaerungen und Ratschlaege sind
Teil der Werbung, Teil der Sprache des Marktes, die ihre eigene
Schriftlichkeit entwickelt und viele darin einbindet.  Doch selbst
der gebildetste Teilhaber an den Marktablaeufen kann diesen Prozess
nicht anhalten, denn die an diesen Ablauf teilhabende Schriftlichkeit
unterscheidet sich von der Schriftlichkeit, die in einem Produkt oder
seiner Werbung verkoerpert ist.  Zu jeder Zeit sind, wie im Leben,
irrationale Elemente auf dem Markt praesent; diese sind aber nicht zu
vergleichen mit dem Ausmass, in dem die Sprache des Marktes die
Hysterie etwa des Schwarzen Montags im Jahr 1987 an der New Yorker
Boerse reflektierte oder ihre pragmatische Funktion bisweilen gaenzlich
aufgibt.

Wir alle klagen darueber, dass unsere Intimsphaere kleiner wird,
erlauben aber gleichzeitig durch unsere Praesenz auf dem Markt, dass
uns die vom Markt ausgeuebte Integrationskraft erfasst, ohne zu sehen,
wie eng diese beiden Aspekte zusammenhaengen.  Die Schriftkultur hatte
frueher auch eine Schutzfunktion ausgeuebt und Regeln der Diskretion
und des Anstands festgeschrieben.  Die Illiteralitaet indes versetzt
uns in Furcht; sie macht uns zwar effizienter, oeffnet aber all den
Mitteln Tuer und Tor, die uns unserer Identitaet berauben.  Wenn wir
unsere Geschaefte online betreiben, geben wir, ohne zu zoegern, unsere
persoenlichen Daten und die Nummer unserer Kreditkarte preis und
setzen dabei stillschweigend einen Bereich der Privatheit voraus, der
fuer den Kode unseres schriftkulturellen Verhaltens selbstverstaendlich
war.  Aber gerade diejenigen, die Bildung und Kommunikationsformen
aus dem Umgang mit Computern gewonnen haben, sollten wissen, wie
unbegrenzt die Macht des Netzes ist, wenn es darum geht, fuer alle nur
denkbaren Verwendungen Informationen zu suchen, zu finden und zu
klassifizieren.

In diesem neuen Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur wendet sich die
Werbung nicht mehr nur an einen undifferenzierten grossen Markt,
sondern sehr differenziert auch an kleinere Gruppen, selbst an das
Individuum.  "Sag mir, was du kaufen oder verkaufen moechtest, und ich
sage dir, wer du bist": Diese Feststellung beschreibt sehr genau, wie
der Zeichenvorgang auf dem Markt uns die Beteiligten transparent
macht.  Der enorme Aufwand, mit dem heute ein neues Muesli, eine neue
Software, ein Wahlkampf, ein Film oder eine Sportveranstaltung
vermarktet werden, hat aus der Sprache der Werbung eine eigene
Sprache gemacht mit einem eigenen Vokabular und einer eigenen
Grammatik.  Diese veraendern sich stetig, weil sich die von ihnen
dargestellte Welt schnell und stetig veraendert.  "Sag mir, was du
kaufst, und ich sag dir, wer du bist."  Unaufhoerlich und ueberall
machen enorm erfindungsreiche Digitaltechniken Aufnahmen von uns, die
Feinabstimmung uebernimmt der Markt.  Das Kaufen von Produkten ist
laengst vorbei.  Heute kaufen uns die Produkte.

Werbung ist nicht mehr nur Mitteilung oder Erlaeuterung.  Werbung ist
Informationsverarbeitung mit bisweilen bizarren Ausmassen und darueber
hinaus sehr erfindungsreich, wenn es um die Querverweisung von
Information und die Feinabstimmung der Botschaft auf die
individuellen Beduerfnisse hin geht.  Automatische Datenanalyse wird
ergaenzt durch Abstimmungsmethoden, die das Gewicht der Woerter den
spezifischen Beduerfnissen des Adressaten anpassen.  In der Realitaet
des Marktes und seines Gehilfen, der Werbung, werden Sprachen, die
sich auf Kunst, Erziehung, Ideologie oder Sexualitaet beziehen, von
der grenzenlosen Vermittlungsmaschinerie eingenommen, die den
pragmatischen Rahmen unserer heutigen Existenz ausmacht.  Nichts ist
wertvoller als das Wissen darum, wer wir sind.  Vermutlich sind jene
Makler, die mit den Informationen ueber einen jeden einzelnen von uns
handeln, auf diesem Markt der vielen miteinander konkurrierenden
partiellen Literalitaeten die erfolgreichsten.

Im Verlauf dieser Entwicklung hat die Sprache ihre Moeglichkeiten
erschoepft und die Schriftkultur ihre beherrschende Rolle in unserer
Kultur verloren.  Eine jede schriftkulturelle AEusserung ging
stillschweigend davon aus, dass der Mensch die optimale
Informationsquelle und der ideale Empfaenger sei.  Die ‘illiterate’
Botschaft kann sich automatisch vermitteln, als Bild oder als Text,
als Video oder als Internet-Spamming, was immer fuer das auserkorene
menschliche Ziel am treffsichersten erscheint.  Wir haben gar keine
andere Wahl.  Direkte Verhandlungen zwischen Personen sind laengst dem
Austausch ueber Faxgeraete gewichen und werden zukuenftig als
Verhandlungen zwischen Softwareprogrammen gefuehrt werden.  Die Folgen
davon werden so weitreichend sein, dass es wenig Sinn ergaebe, auf
diese Situation emotional mit reiner Begeisterung oder blosser
Verachtung zu reagieren.

Die Pragmatik des heutigen Marktes unterliegt der Notwendigkeit, den
UEberfluss staendig auszuweiten, um den von Begehr und Erwartung
getriebenen Austausch von Guetern und Dienstleistungen anzutreiben.
Derartiges Begehren und derartige Erwartungen in der globalen Skala
der menschlichen Interaktionen sind von einer einzigen beherrschenden
Form von Bildung und Schriftkultur nicht mehr in den Griff zu
bekommen.  Hunderte von Literalitaeten, die ihrerseits eine ebenso
grosse Zahl von Selbstkonstituierungsformen ueberall auf der Welt
verkoerpern, sind unter dem Superzeichen, das wir Markt nennen,
zusammengefasst.

Der Markt--im engen Sinne als Umschlagplatz von Guetern und als
Zeichenprozess, der Struktur und Dynamik verbindet--bringt all das
zusammen, was die Beziehungen zwischen dem Individuum und seinem
sozialen Umfeld regelt: Sprache, Sitten, Gebraeuche, Wissen,
Technologie, Bilder, Klaenge, Gerueche und vieles andere.  Durch den
Markt werden Wirtschaftsformen bestaetigt oder einer schmerzlichen
Umstrukturierung unterworfen.  Die zurueckliegenden Jahre haben
diesbezueglich sehr viel Unruhe verursacht, aber auch oekonomische
Chancen geboten--ein Ausdruck neuer pragmatischer Umstaende.
Konkurrenz, Spezialisierung und Kooperation haben sich verstaerkt.
Ein aufregendes und zugleich fuer manche beunruhigendes Wachstum der
wirtschaftlichen Aktivitaet hat neue Hochleistungsmaerkte
hervorgebracht.  Phaenomene wie just in time, point of sale und
elektronischer Austausch mussten sich entwickeln, weil die neue
Lebenspraxis sie erforderlich machte.

Deshalb koennen wir auch nicht so ohne weiteres den Erklaerungen folgen,
die die Dynamik des Wirtschaftslebens auf die technologischen
Veraenderungen zurueckfuehren.  Die schnelleren Wirtschaftszyklen
verlaufen nicht neben den neuen praktischen Erfahrungen menschlicher
Selbstkonstituierung, sondern sind auf sie bezogen.  Kognitive
Ressourcen zaehlen zu den wichtigsten Guetern der neuen
wirtschaftlichen Erfahrungen.  Und der Markt richtet sich darauf ein,
indem er fuer den beschleunigten Umschlag dieser Gueter Mechanismen und
Zeichenprozesse entwickelt, die eine bislang nicht erreichte
technologische Komplexitaet aufweisen.  Dynamische Systeme fuer
intelligente Agenten und verbesserte Moeglichkeiten fuer die
Einschaetzung von Marktchancen und Prognosen haben neue Algorithmen
hervorgebracht, die diese neuen kognitiven Ressourcen angemessen
ausdruecken.  Sie koennten aufbluehen in einem Kontext, der Freiheit von
jeglicher Hierarchie und Zentralismus, Losloesung von Sequentialitaet
und Determinismus erfordert.  Selbst das interessante
Wirtschaftsmodell, das Wirtschaft als ein OEkosystem versteht (ich
beziehe mich hier auf Rothschilds Bionomics), verraet doch in letzter
Konsequenz eine deterministische Sehweise.

Zeichenprozesse (auch Semiosen genannt) koennen keine wirtschaftlichen
Veraenderungen hervorrufen.  Aber Zeichenprozesse reflektieren in der
Form hochentwickelter Transaktionen die Veraenderungen, die sich in
der pragmatischen Grundlage des Menschen vollzogen haben.  Die
zahlreichen neuen Unternehmen von Fast-food-Ketten ueber
Mikrochip-Hersteller bis zu RoboterEntwicklern, die das menschliche
Wissen in die neuen Waren und Dienstleistungen umsetzen, zeigen die
Notwendigkeit dieser pragmatischen Veraenderungen.  Angebotsvielfalt
und UEberfluss koennen vielleicht auf Wettbewerb und Zusammenarbeit
zurueckgefuehrt werden, aber die eigentliche Triebkraft der Wirtschaft
und des Marktes ist das objektive Beduerfnis nach Effizienzebenen, die
der heute erreichten globalen Skala menschlicher Taetigkeit
entsprechen.  Eine zentrale Planung wie ueberhaupt jegliche
zentralistische Struktur hat sich nicht wegen des technologischen
Fortschritts eruebrigt, sondern weil sie nicht mehr mit effizienten
praktischen Erfahrungen in Einklang zu bringen war.

Wie die Maerkte in einer Zivilisation jenseits der Schriftkultur
aussehen, hat sich aus den vorausgegangenen UEberlegungen
herauskristallisiert.  Sie sind gekennzeichnet durch vielfaeltige
Vermittlungsinstanzen, rasche Entwicklungszyklen sowie eine globale
Verknuepfung und Abhaengigkeit.  An die Stelle des Menschen als
optimaler Informationsquelle und idealem Empfaenger treten
elektronisch vermittelte Datenverarbeitungsprozesse, die sich
jederzeit an jeden in einem jeden Kontext wenden koennen: an die
Produzenten von Rohmaterialien, an Energielieferanten, an Hersteller
und Verkaeufer.  Die Analyse des Kaeuferverhaltens beim Scannen der
Internetangebote geht direkt in Programme ein, die Produktion,
Marketing und Distribution steuern.  Kauf und Verkauf regeln sich
nicht mehr ueber persoenliche Verkaufsgepraeche, Fax oder e-mail,
sondern als Interaktion zwischen Programmen.  An die Stelle von
Massenmaerkten treten spezialisierte Einzelmaerkte.  Die Dynamik dieser
Maerkte, die sich in den einzelnen Zellen der Selbstorganisation
ausdrueckt, entspricht dabei der Dynamik der Menschen, die sich in
dieser ihrer Realitaet konstituieren.



Kapitel 2:

Sprache und Arbeitswelt

Arbeit ist ein Mittel der Selbsterhaltung, das ueber den primitiven
Kampf um das UEberleben hinausgeht.  Den Begriff Arbeit koennen wir
eigentlich erst verwenden, wenn wir von einem Bewusstsein des Menschen
seiner selbst und von einem Bewusstsein seiner Selbstkonstituierung in
praktischen Erfahrungen ausgehen koennen.  Das Bewusstsein von Arbeit
und die Anfaenge der Sprache gehoeren eng zusammen.

Unter Arbeit verstehen wir nicht die spezifische Ausfuehrung dieser
oder jener Taetigkeit, sondern Muster und Profile menschlichen
Handelns.  Wir betrachten sie also vor allem unter einem funktionalen
Gesichtspunkt, der auch die Frage aufwirft, wie sich diese Muster
reproduzieren.  Interaktion, Veraenderung, Wachstum, Verbreitung und
Beendigung sind Bestandteile dieser Profile.  Es ist offensichtlich,
dass die Arbeitsprofile der landwirtschaftlichen Taetigkeit sich von
denen der vorindustriellen, der industriellen oder der
postindustriellen Zeit unterscheiden.  Wir wollen im folgenden die
Arbeitsprofile der durch Schriftkultur gekennzeichneten Arbeitswelt
mit denen im Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur vergleichen.

Die landwirtschaftliche Taetigkeit ist wesentlich von topographischen
und klimatischen Bedingungen abhaengig.  Gleichwohl hat sich bei den
in diese Taetigkeit eingebundenen Menschen unabhaengig von ihrer
jeweiligen geographischen Lage eine kohaerente Erfahrung eingestellt.
Die in der jeweiligen Sprache zum Ausdruck gebrachte Erfahrung weist
einen klar umrissenen Satz von Problemen, Fragen und Wissen auf, der
trotz des jeweils fragmentarisierten Weltblicks insgesamt homogener
ist, als wir erwartet haetten.  Im Vergleich dazu sprechen die
Chiphersteller im Silicon Valley oder in entlegenen chinesischen
Provinzen, in Russland oder in einem Entwicklungsland Osteuropas, in
Asien oder Afrika von vornherein dieselbe Sprache und stehen vor
denselben Problemen.

Landwirtschaftliche Taetigkeit verlaeuft nach dem bottom-up-Prinzip,
das in diesem Fall ein reaktives Prinzip ist.  Die Reaktion auf
gegebene Probleme fuehrte langsam, aber stetig zu Entscheidungen
zwischen Handlungsalternativen.  Erfahrung fuehrte zu repetitiven
Handlungsmustern.  Effiziente Erfahrungen setzten sich durch, andere
wurden verworfen.  So formte sich allmaehlich ein Bestand an Wissen,
der einem jeden, der in diese UEberlebenspraktiken eingebunden war,
zur Verfuegung stand.  Im Falle der Chipfabrik ist die Struktur nach
dem top-down-Prinzip gestaltet: Von vornherein sind bestimmte und
klar definierte Ziele und Gruende sowie das notwendige, seiner Natur
nach nicht in Schriftlichkeit eingebundene Wissen Teil der
Erfahrungsstruktur.  Nur so ist die hohe Effizienz zu erreichen.
Durch begleitende Massnahmen werden die verfuegbaren Faehigkeiten und
Fertigkeiten unablaessig verbessert.  Die Taetigkeit ist programmiert.
Eine klare Vorstellung von den Zielen des Unternehmens--hohe Qualitaet,
hohe Effizienz, ausgepraegte Anpassungsfaehigkeit an neue
Erfordernisse--ist in das gesamte Unternehmenssystem eingebaut.

In beiden Modellen entwickelt sich die Sprache als Teil und Ausdruck
dieser Erfahrung.  Koordination, Kommunikation, Aufzeichnung und
Wissensvermittlung erfordern fuer den reproduktiven Prozess der Arbeit
die Transferleistung der Sprache.  Gewiss ist die Sprache der
landwirtschaftlichen Lebenspraxis natuerlicher und staerker auf den
Naturzustand des damaligen Menschen bezogen gewesen als die Sprache
im Chipzeitalter jenseits der Schriftkultur, die von einer
ausserordentlichen Praezision sein muss, um den hochspezialisierten und
hocheffizienten Arbeitsablaeufen zu genuegen.  Die Funktionen der
letzteren Sprachform unterscheiden sich von denen der natuerlichen
Sprache, die als allgemeines Mittel menschlicher Interaktion jedoch
nach wie vor gueltig bleibt.

Diese einleitenden Bemerkungen zum sich veraendernden Verhaeltnis
zwischen Sprache und Arbeit moegen genuegen.  Unsere Terminologie
orientiert sich am heute gaengigen Jargon der Genetik und ihrem
Gegenstueck, der Memetik.  Dennoch ist in diesem Zusammenhang Vorsicht
geboten, denn Memetik ist auf die quantitative Analyse kultureller
Dynamik gerichtet, wohingegen sich die Semiotik vornehmlich mit
qualitativen Aspekten beschaeftigt.

Wie wir bereits eroertert haben, liefert die biologische
Evolutionstheorie heute die Metaphern fuer die neueren
Wirtschaftswissenschaften wie auch fuer die Theorien ueber
Wissenserwerb und Wissensverbreitung oder die Reproduktion von
Gedanken.  Viele beschaeftigen sich bereits mit der neuen Sparte der
memetischen Forschung.  Die Mehrheit widmet sich effektiven, d. h.
meist computergestuetzten Verfahren zur Entwicklung von Mechanismen,
die die menschlichen Interaktionen verbessern sollen.  So aufregend
dies alles ist, koennten sich jedoch qualitative UEberlegungen als
mindestens ebenso nuetzlich erweisen, wenn wir sie in konkrete
praktische Erfahrungen umsetzen koennten.  Wenn sich aus der
Evolutionstheorie ergibt, dass jeder lebendige Organismus
zweckbestimmt ist, dann laesst sich die Dynamik der menschlichen
Taetigkeit, wie sie sich in aufeinanderfolgenden pragmatischen Rahmen
ihrer Entwicklungsstadien niedergeschlagen hat, mit dem Mechanismus
der natuerlichen Auslese allein nicht erklaeren.  An diesem Punkt zeigt
sich der Unterschied zwischen der Auffassung vom Zeichencharakter der
menschlichen Interaktion, auch der in der Arbeit sich vollziehenden
Interaktion, und der quantitativen Auffassung.  Solange natuerliche
Auslese selbst als praktische Erfahrung--als Wahl zwischen mehreren
Moeglichkeiten--verstanden wird, kann man sie nicht gleichzeitig zur
Erklaerung dafuer, wie sie sich vollzieht, heranziehen.

Wir koennen Arbeit in Analogie zu den Maschinen--denen von gestern und
denen von heute--als eine Maschine betrachten, die sich selbst
reproduziert.  In der Terminologie der Memetik wuerde man Arbeit als
eine komplexe replikative Einheit beschreiben, als eine Meta-Meme.
Aber beide Vergleiche beziehen sich auf den Aspekt des
Informationsaustausches, der nur ein Teil des Zeichenprozesses ist.
Damit wollen wir nicht sagen, dass Arbeit auf Zeichenprozesse oder auf
Sprache reduzierbar ist.  Uns interessiert hier die Verbindung
zwischen Arbeit und Zeichen bzw. zwischen Arbeit und Sprache.  Uns
interessiert ferner, inwieweit und inwiefern pragmatische
Handlungsrahmen und die Merkmale der Spracherfahrung sich gegenseitig
beeinflussen und voneinander abhaengig sind und inwieweit dieser
Zusammenhang memetisch zu verstehen ist, ohne allerdings darauf
reduziert zu werden.


Innerhalb und ausserhalb der Welt

Wenn wir die Leistungsfaehigkeit der unmittelbaren Erfahrung mit der
Leistungsfaehigkeit von vermittelten Erfahrungsformen--vermittelt
durch Werkzeuge, Zeichen oder Sprachen--vergleichen, so zeigt sich,
dass die Effizienz der durch Zeichensysteme vermittelten Handlungen
hoeher ist.  Die Quelle dieser Effizienzsteigerung liegt in der
kognitiven Leistung, die die angemessenen Mittel mit dem erstrebten
Ziel koordiniert.  Im Rueckblick koennen wir verstehen, wie ungeheuer
gross diese Aufgabe war: Beobachtung, Vergleich, Entwicklung und
Abwaegung von Alternativen mussten ins Spiel gebracht werden.  Die
Nachbildung solcher kognitiven Prozesse ist nach allem, was wir nach
juengsten wissenschaftlichen und technologischen Forschungen in diesem
Bereich wissen, noch lange nicht absehbar, zumal solche kognitiven
Prozesse sich ueber lange Zeitraeume entwickelt haben.

Sprache ist wie jedes andere Zeichensystem ein integraler Bestandteil
bei der Selbstkonstituierung und Selbstbehauptung des Menschen.  Sie
spielt in diesem Prozess eine dynamische Rolle.  Sie entspricht den
verschiedenen pragmatischen Zusammenhaengen, in denen die Menschen
ihre strukturale Wirklichkeit in die Wirklichkeit ihres Lebens
hineinprojizieren.  Das biophysische System, innerhalb dessen sich
diese Projektion abspielt, wurde und wird nachhaltigen Veraenderungen
unterworfen.  Diese Veraenderungen spiegeln sich in der biophysischen
Veraenderung des Menschen wider.  Als Teil dieser sich veraendernden
Welt und als deren Beobachter befindet sich der Mensch mithin
gleichzeitig innerhalb und ausserhalb der Welt: innerhalb der Welt als
eine genetische Sequenz, ausserhalb der Welt als ihr Bewusstsein und
Gewissen, das sich neben allen anderen Formen des Bewusstseins auch in
der Arbeit ausdrueckt.

Ob wir nun Sprache in ihrem sehr begrenzten fruehen Stadium oder als
ein potentiell universelles Ausdrucks-, Darstellungs- und
Kommunikationssystem betrachten, wir muessen sie immer in ihrer
Abhaengigkeit von der menschlichen Natur sehen.  Ebenso muessen wir ihr
Verhaeltnis zu anderen Ausdrucks-, Darstellungs- und
Kommunikationsformen miteinbeziehen.  Die Notwendigkeit von Sprache
zeigt sich in dem Mass, in dem die evolutionaere Bestimmung und die
Selbstbestimmung des Menschen oder der Gesellschaft korrelieren.
Sprache ergibt sich aus den praktischen Erfahrungen des Menschen.
Gleichzeitig aber ist sie fuer diese konstitutiv, und zwar zusammen
mit vielen anderen Elementen der menschlichen Praxis, wie etwa der
biologischen Anlage, der Heuristik und Logik, Dialektik und
Ausbildung.  Das gilt fuer alle Stadien der Sprachentwicklung.  In der
Form, die sie innerhalb der Schriftkultur bekommen hat, bewirkte die
Sprache die zunehmende Spezialisierung und Fragmentarisierung der
menschlichen Praxis.  Wir sind heutzutage Zeugen und zugleich
Betreiber eines Prozesses, in dem der schriftkulturelle Gebrauch von
Sprache durch die Analphabetisierung der vielen Sprachen in der
Arbeitswelt, auf dem Markt und sogar im gesellschaftlichen Leben
ersetzt wird.

Zeichensysteme aller Art, vor allem aber die Sprache, haben die
vielen Projekte aufgenommen und gespeichert, die die Bedingungen der
Lebenspraxis, wie sie in den vorangegangenen Kapiteln beschrieben
wurden, veraendert haben.  Eine jede Veraenderung hat die strukturalen
Grenzen der Sprache evidenter gemacht.  Diese Grenzen sind heute um
so schaerfer konturiert, je mehr neue Sprache, vor allem
Visualisierungen, entwickelt werden, die sich den neuen Erwartungen
stellen, Erwartungen bezueglich verbesserter Expressivitaet, hoeherer
Verarbeitungsgeschwindigkeit und Interoperabilitaet--ein Bild kann
weitere Handlungen veranlassen.

Die vielen nebeneinander existierenden Sprachen sind zwar alle sehr
spezialisiert, aber insofern ihrem Charakter nach global, als sie
ueberall auf der Welt fuer diesen speziellen Bereich Verwendung finden.
Eine Chipfabrik, um bei unserem Beispiel zu bleiben, eine
Pizzabaeckerei oder eine Hamburgerkueche kann jederzeit in jede Ecke
dieser Welt schluesselfertig geliefert werden.  Die Sprachen der
Mathematik, der Ingenieurwissenschaft oder der Genetik koennen fuer
sich allein genommen durch all die Merkmale beschrieben werden, die
die natuerliche Sprache aufweist und die sie aus diesem Grunde fuer die
Komplexitaeten in der heute erreichten Skala unserer Aktivitaet
unbrauchbar gemacht haben: Sequentialitaet, Dualismus, Zentralismus
und Determinismus.  Aber sie koennen in andere praktische
Erfahrungshorizonte, etwa der Automatisierung, integriert werden, so
dass sich aus ihnen eine neue Dynamik entwickeln kann.  Sie sind
sicherlich weniger ausdrucksfaehig als die natuerliche Sprache, aber
dafuer um so praeziser.


Wir sind, was wir tun

In unserer heutigen Welt ist Kommunikation weitgehend versachlicht
und vollzieht sich ueber die Vermittlung durch ein Produkt.  Ihre
Quelle ist die menschliche Arbeit.  Insofern traegt sie auch viele
Merkmale jener Sprachen, die in diese Arbeit eingebunden sind.  In
der durch das Produkt gegebenen physischen oder geistigen
Wirklichkeit werden Spezialsprachen in die universale Sprache der
Beduerfnisbefriedigung oder der Schaffung neuer Beduerfnisse
rueckuebersetzt, wobei diese Beduerfnisse durch die
Vermittlungsmechanismen des Marktes weiterverarbeitet werden.  Die
Versachlichung der Sprache (von lateinisch res: die Umformung von
Leben, Sprache, Gefuehl, Arbeit in Sachen) ergibt sich aus der
verfremdenden Logik des Marktes und seiner Natur als Zeichenprozess.

Maerkte abstrahieren die individuellen Beitraege zu einem Produkt.
Zuallererst wird die Sprache selbst versachlicht und konsumiert.  Der
Markt verdinglicht diesen Sprachbeitrag, indem er das Leben, die
Energie, die Zweifel, die Zeit, vor allem aber die Sprache zu einer
Ware macht, die als Produkt auf dem Markt angeboten wird.  Dieses
hohe Mass an Integration fuehrt zu Bedingungen, in denen hohe
Effizienz--so viel wie moeglich so billig wie moeglich--zum
UEberlebenskriterium wird.  Menschliche Individualitaet wird durch das
Produkt absorbiert.  Die Menschen legen im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes
ihr Leben und alles, was dazugehoert--Geschichte, Erziehung, Familie,
Gefuehle, Kultur, Wuensche und Sehnsuechte--in die Ergebnisse ihrer
praktischen Erfahrungen.  Diese Absorbierung des Menschen im Produkt
vollzieht sich auf verschiedenen Ebenen.  Neben der Sprache wird aber
auch das sich in der Arbeit konstituierende Individuum versachlicht
und konsumiert: Das Produkt beinhaltet einen Teil der begrenzten
Lebenszeit derer, die es entwickelt haben.

Jede Form vermittelter Arbeit haengt von den vermittelnden Instanzen
ab.  So wie eine bestimmte Arbeitsform durch eine andere,
effizientere, ersetzt werden kann, wird auch die vermittelnde Sprache
durch andere Mittel ersetzt.  Jene Sprachen, die urspruenglich die
Jagd koordinierten oder die Fruehformen der Landwirtschaft
organisierten, mussten den nachfolgenden praktischen Erfahrungen der
Selbstkonstituierung durch Sprache Platz machen.  Dies gilt fuer jede
Form von Arbeit, ob sie nun landwirtschaftliche, industrielle,
kuenstlerische oder ideologische Produkte hervorbringt.  Hier greifen
die Metaphern aus der Genetik und der Evolutionstheorie.  Wir koennen
die Evolution der Arbeit in memetischer Begrifflichkeit beschreiben,
wir koennen damit allerdings nicht hinreichend die aktive Rolle von
Zeichenprozessen beschreiben.  Die menschliche Reproduktion in ihren
sexuellen und kulturellen Auspraegungen wuerde darueber hinaus
bedeutungslos, wenn wir sie losgeloest von dem pragmatischen Rahmen
betrachten wuerden, in dem sich die menschliche Selbstkonstituierung
vollzieht.

Um zu zeigen, wie Sprache konsumiert wird, wollen wir einen kurzen
Blick auf den Arbeitsbereich werfen, den wir Erziehung nennen.
Heutzutage hat sich der Bedarf an fortlaufender Ausbildung drastisch
erhoeht.  Das Paradigma einer einmaligen, lebenslang gueltigen
Ausbildung hat sich gemeinsam mit Schriftkultur und der auf sie
gruendenden Bildung erschoepft.  Kuerzere Produktionszyklen erfordern
veraenderte Werkzeuge und eine dazugehoerende veraenderte Ausbildung.
Eine fuer eine Lebensdauer gueltige Berufsausbildung, die moeglich war,
als der Fortschritt der Technologie sich noch linear vollzog,
erforderte lediglich die Pflege der einmal erworbenen Faehigkeiten und
geringfuegige Anpassung des vorhandenen Wissens.  Dieses Ideal gehoert
der Vergangenheit an.  Die heutigen Effizienzanforderungen muessen in
Ausbildungsstrategien umgesetzt werden, die weniger kostenaufwendig,
aber auch weniger lange gueltig sind als die, die man mit der
Schriftkultur erwarb.  Diese Strategien produzieren die heute
benoetigten gebildeten Operatoren aller Art, Ausbildung wird selbst zu
einem Produkt, das von vielen Weiterbildungsfirmen angeboten wird.
Zu deren Kunden gehoeren die Angestellten von Fast-food-Ketten, die
Betreiber von Atomkraftwerken, Tiefkuehleinrichtungen, Mitglieder der
Parlamente und Netzwerkbetreiber.  Alle diese Produkte werden auf dem
Markt gehandelt, und auf dem Markt wird die Sprache der Werbung, des
Designs und der OEffentlichkeitsarbeit ebenso konsumiert wie die
Ausbildung, die sich zunehmend auf aussersprachliche
Kommunikationsmittel verlegt.


Maschine und Schriftkultur

Der Mensch hat Maschinen gebaut, die den menschlichen Arm und seine
Funktionen imitiert und auf diese Weise die Natur der Arbeit
veraendert haben.  Die Faehigkeiten, die man zur Beherrschung dieser
Maschinen benoetigte, unterschieden sich von den handwerklichen
Faehigkeiten, die nun nicht mehr von Generation zu Generation
uebertragen wurden und daher an Gueltigkeit und Dauerhaftigkeit
verloren.  Die industrielle Revolution erreichte Effizienzebenen, die
fuer den Unterhalt von Maschinen und Arbeitern ausreichten.  Diese
Maschinen wurden permanent verbessert und erforderten immer besser
ausgebildete Operatoren, deren Ausbildung darauf ausgerichtet war,
das Maximum aus den ihnen anvertrauten Produktionsmitteln
herauszuholen.

Heute verliert die natuerliche Sprache fuer die praktischen Erfahrungen
des Menschen immer mehr an Bedeutung.  Das, was uns als verminderte
Schreib-, Leseund Ausdrucksfaehigkeit erscheint, ist tatsaechlich ein
Symptom fuer eine neue Grundlage der Lebenspraxis.  Die Ausdrucks- und
Kommunikationsmittel der Schriftkultur werden nicht nur durch andere
Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsformen ergaenzt, sondern zunehmend durch
sie ersetzt.  Oder sie werden auf ein stereotypes Repertoire
reduziert, das man leicht mechanisieren, automatisieren und
schliesslich als erledigt betrachten kann.  Die Kontrolle eines
automatisierten Montagebandes, der Betrieb einer komplizierten
Maschine, die Ausfuehrung einer sehr begrenzten Taetigkeit ohne
UEberblick ueber den gesamten Arbeitszusammenhang und viele aehnliche
Funktionen bringen den Menschen heute in eine Situation, in der die
Kompetenz des Einzelnen darauf reduziert ist, die gestellte
spezifische Aufgabe kompetent zu loesen.  Bevor diese Aufgabe
wegrationalisiert wird, wird sie stereotypisiert.  Sofern Sprache
ergaenzend zu der involvierten Fachsprache hier noch eine Rolle spielt,
wird sie komprimiert und auf den begrenzten, d. h. noetigen und
moeglichen Kommunikationsbedarf hin zugeschnitten und der sich
veraendernden Situation permanent und schnell angepasst.

Ein Handbuch fuer den Betrieb oder die Reparatur einer
hochkomplizierten Maschine oder Waffe beinhaltet heute weniger Woerter
als Bilder.  Und die verwendeten Woerter sind auf das Bild bezogen.
Oft ist aber das Handbuch bereits durch ein Video, eine Laserdiskette,
eine CD-ROM oder durch im Netzwerk verankerte und jederzeit
aufrufbare Bedienungshilfen ersetzt.  Oder aber die Maschine selbst
beinhaltet ein computerisiertes Handbuch, dessen Pages (auf dem
Bildschirm) aufgerufen werden koennen und die notwendigen
Informationen fuer die einzelnen Bedienungsschritte liefern; dies kann
auch in Form synthetischer Sprache fuer kurze AEusserungen und
vorfabrizierte Dialoge geschehen.  Hierfuer nur einige Beispiele: In
den USA werden bereits Dollarnoten entwickelt, die uns ihren Wert
nennen; Autos sind mit Geraeten ausgestattet, die uns ansprechen, wenn
wir die Tuer nicht geschlossen oder den Sicherheitsgurt nicht angelegt
haben; Glueckwunschkarten koennen bereits muendlich aufgezeichnete
Botschaften des Absenders (und zukuenftig vermutlich sogar laufende
Bilder) enthalten.  Auch wenn derartige Artifakte den oberflaechlichen
Geschmack ihrer Benutzer verraten, verweisen sie letztlich doch alle
auf eine neue Lebenspraxis und die ihr zugrundeliegende Struktur, die
der Komplexitaet der neuen Skala der Menschheit gerechter wird.

Vielleicht landen die Stimmen, die wir heute in unseren Autos hoeren,
schon bald in einem Museum, wenn das allgemeine Leitsystem fuer unsere
Autos installiert ist und wir nur noch den Zielort und bestimmte
Routen und Vorlieben eingeben muessen.  Und selbst das Supertech-Auto
koennte sich schnell zu seinen musealen Vorlaeufern gesellen, wenn die
Energieorgien, die wir taeglich zu den Stosszeiten auf Strassen und
Autobahnen erleben, durch rationellere Arbeits- und Lebensstrategien
ersetzt werden.  Die Telekommunikation befindet sich noch in den
Kinderschuhen und laesst erst vage erkennen, was sich daraus noch alles
entwickeln koennte.  Die sprechende Glueckwunschkarte koennte durch ein
Programm ersetzt werden, das sich an die Geburtstage unserer
Verwandten und Freunde erinnert, das Profil des Adressaten aus den
gespeicherten Daten (Vorlieben, Lebensumstaende, etc.) heraussucht und
daraus eine Originalbotschaft erstellt, die mit der elektronischen
Zeitung zum Morgenkaffee auf den Tisch kommt.  All das koennte bereits
heute mit geringem Aufwand von den Herstellern von Bildschirmschonern
angefertigt werden.

Wie immer die Zukunft aussehen wird, deutlich ist, dass sich gerade
auch die Produktionsmittel immer weiter entwickeln.  Der
Bildungsstand in bezug auf die von der Schriftkultur bereitgestellte
Bildung bleibt jedoch auf einem relativ geringem Niveau, weil die
Menschen fuer die meisten heutigen Arbeitsformen diese Form von
Bildung nicht mehr benoetigen.  Einer der Gruende liegt sicherlich
darin, dass die meisten neuen Maschinen das Wissen, das man fuer ihren
Betrieb benoetigt, in sich einprogrammiert haben.  Sie sind allesamt
viel effizienter als Menschen.  Diese Entwicklung hat auch ihre
Auswirkungen auf die Universitaetsausbildung.  Sofern Universitaeten
ihre Studenten auf die Arbeitswelt vorbereiten sollen, muessen sie
sich denselben hohen Effizienzerwartungen stellen.  Daher sind
Universitaeten heute zunehmend Ausbildungsstaetten fuer bestimmte
hochqualifizierte Berufe und weniger Orte der Bildung im
traditionellen Sinne der allgemeinen kulturellen Bildung und der
Vermittlung von Grundlagenwissen in allen Bereichen.

Wenn wir auf den niedrigen Bildungsstand verweisen, wollen wir damit
nicht in die Klage der Humanisten einstimmen, sondern die
tatsaechliche Situation auf dem Arbeitsmarkt beschreiben.  Die
Tatsache, dass die natuerliche Sprache zumindest in ihrer
schriftsprachlichen Form weder die wichtigste Vermittlungsinstanz fuer
kollektive Erfahrung noch das allgemeingueltige Ausbildungsmittel
darstellt, ist struktural bedingt.  Die heutige praktische Erfahrung
menschlicher Selbstkonstituierung beruht in allen ihren
Aspekten--Arbeit, Markt, Ausbildung, gesellschaftliches Leben--mehr
auf Bildern als auf Schriftlichkeit.  Wo immer eine bestimmte Norm
oder ein Gesetz zu befolgen ist, verwenden wir heute piktographische
Darstellungen, und zwar nicht nur, um die Grenzen der einzelnen
Nationalsprachen zu ueberwinden (wie auf Flughaefen, in Olympiastadien,
bei Verkehrszeichen oder bei internationalen Handelsbeziehungen),
sondern als Ausdruck einer bestimmten Lebensart und Funktionsweise
des Menschen.  Die heutige Kommunikation ist eindeutig vom visuellen
Element beherrscht.

Woerter und Saetze, die im Verlauf ihrer historischen Verwendung in
unterschiedlichen sozialen, geographischen und historischen
Zusammenhaengen zu mehrdeutig geworden sind, erfordern zuviel
Bildungsanstrengungen, um einer erfolgreichen Kommunikation zu dienen.
Die auf Schriftkultur basierende Kommunikation erfordert einen
hoeheren Aufwand als den, der fuer das Hervorbringen, Erkennen und
Betrachten von Bildern noetig ist.  Bilder verkoerpern eine
positivistische Einstellung und bringen eine relativistische Haltung
mit sich.  Sie muessen nicht in sequentieller Abfolge gelesen werden,
ihre Lektuere erfordert keine zeitlichen und finanziellen
Lernanstrengungen, sie weisen nicht die der Schriftkultur eigene
Regelstrenge auf, kurz: Der Gebrauch von Bildern spiegelt unsere
Effizienzerwartungen wider, die sich aus der neuen Skala des Menschen
ergeben.  Die Verlagerung von einer eher schriftlich orientierten zu
einer eher visuell orientierten Kultur ergibt sich nicht aus den
Entwicklungen der Medientechnologie, sie ist vielmehr das Ergebnis
fundamentaler Veraenderungen der Arbeits- und Wirtschaftswelt, die
diese neuen Medien erst erforderlich und schliesslich ihre Produktion
und Verbreitung moeglich gemacht haben.

Die hier diskutierte Veraenderung ist sehr komplex.  Die Beduerfnisse
einer vermittelten Praxis und die neuen leistungsfaehigen
Vermittlungsmechanismen der Massenkommunikation, die das Individuum
in den Mechanismus einer globalen Wirtschaft integrieren, kommen in
dieser Veraenderung zum Ausdruck.  Der UEbergang von einer Sprache zu
einer Vielfalt von Spezialsprachen und von direkter zu indirekter
durch Multimedien vielfach vermittelter Kommunikation beschraenkt sich
dabei nicht einfach nur darauf, den Logozentrismus (ein strukturelles
Merkmal von auf Schriftkultur gruendenden Kulturen) und die daran
gebundene Logik abzulegen.  Wir alle sind eingebunden in den Prozess,
der viele Bedeutungszentren an die Stelle des Wortes und der
traditionellen Sprachkompetenzen setzt.  Diese Zentren koennen in der
Subkultur oder in der etablierten Kultur angesiedelt sein.  Nehmen
wir als Beispiel nur die Internet-Cafes, in denen man beim
Kaffeetrinken ueber die Kontinente hinweg kommuniziert, oder die
Gespraeche, die ein japanischer Journalist in einer sowjetischen
Raumstation mit seinen Kollegen fuehrt, oder die Bilder, die wir von
einer Kunstausstellung in Bogota vermittelt bekommen.  Alles dies
sind die Ausdrucksformen der neuen Erfahrungen, die sich im
sogenannten Cyberspace nachvollziehen lassen.


Der Wegwerfmensch

Fuer jedes Phaenomen wird es je nach Standpunkt des Betrachters
unterschiedliche Erklaerungen geben.  Aber unabhaengig von den
Erklaerungen, die man fuer das hier beschriebene Phaenomen anbieten kann,
bleibt die allen Erklaerungen zugrundeliegende Tatsache, dass sich
nachhaltige Veraenderungen vollzogen haben und dass diese Veraenderungen
darauf zurueckzufuehren sind, dass der Mensch seine Identitaet zunehmend
in solchen Formen der Selbstkonstituierung findet, die nicht an
Schriftkultur und schriftkulturelle Bildung geknuepft sind.  Mit dem
allmaehlichen Verzicht auf Lese- und Schreiberfahrungen und dem
Aufkommen anderer Kommunikations- und Rezeptionsformen ist der Mensch
noch einer weiteren Strukturveraenderung unterworfen: der Verlagerung
von Zentralismus auf Dezentralismus, von einem zentripetalen
Existenz- und Handlungsmodell, in dessen Mittelpunkt das
traditionelle Wertsystem (religioese, aesthetische, moralische,
politische Werte usw.) steht, zu einem zentrifugalen Modell: von
einem monolithischen zu einem pluralistischen Modell.  Der Verlust
des Zentrums bedeutet paradoxerweise, dass der Mensch auch seine
zentrale Rolle und seinen Bezugswert verliert.  Das fuehrt zu einer
dramatischen Situation: Wenn die menschliche Kreativitaet den
begrenzten Vorrat an Ressourcen (Mineralien, Energie, Nahrungsmittel,
Wasser usw.) dadurch auszugleichen versucht, dass sie Ersatzquellen
oder eine effizientere Verwendung der traditionellen Ressourcen
findet, dann wird der Mensch selbst zu einer Wegwerfware; je
begrenzter seine praktische Selbstkonstituierung ist, desto
disponibler wird er.

Innerhalb der durch die Schriftkultur gekennzeichneten Lebenspraxis
wurden Maschinen weniger oft ausgewechselt; selbst wenn sie
ausgewechselt oder veraendert wurden, behielt der, der sie betrieb,
seinen Platz.  Die einmal erworbenen Grundfertigkeiten reichten fuer
die Dauer eines Arbeitslebens.  Ebenso waren die konstruierten
Gegenstaende auf lebenslange Dauer angelegt.

Die von uns beschriebene Lebenspraxis jenseits der Schriftkultur mit
ihren schnellen Veraenderungen und immer kuerzer werdenden Zyklen
machte auch den Menschen ersetzbar.  In der neuen Skala der
menschlichen Taetigkeit verliert das grosse und wachsende Angebot der
Ware Mensch zunehmend an Wert: an Marktwert, an geistigem und an
tatsaechlichem Wert.  Die Wuerde des Lebens gibt der ausgekluegelten
Technologie der Lebenserhaltung, dem mechanischen Verlauf des Daseins
und den Studios fuer Fitness und Bodybuilding Raum.  An der
unbegrenzten Boerse der Ersatzteile werden Nieren oder Herzen
(mechanische oder natuerliche) fast genauso gefuehrt wie Schweinemaegen
und Zement, van Goghs Gemaelde, CD-Geraete und hoechstentwickelte
medizinische Instrumente.  Alles gilt als Ware.  Hinter all diesen
Waren verbirgt sich hochspezialisierte Arbeit, die auf dem Niveau des
Profisports oder des Managementprofis bezahlt wird.

Der arbeitende Mensch, der sich mit seiner Arbeit in kurzlebige
Produkte hineinprojiziert, projiziert zugleich deren Disponibilitaet
als neuen moralischen Wert in sie hinein, was nicht ohne Auswirkungen
auf seine eigenen Lebensbedingungen bleibt und schliesslich zur
Aufloesung der traditionellen Werte fuehrt.  Die hohe Effizienz unserer
Arbeit garantiert der Menschheit zwar ausreichende
UEberlebensressourcen, aber nicht mehr die praktischen Erfahrungen,
die die Integritaet des Individuums und die Wuerde des menschlichen
Daseins sichern.  Innerhalb eines schriftkulturellen Diskurses und
der dazugehoerigen Ideologie der Dauerhaftigkeit sorgt diese neue
Moral der Disponibilitaet fuer Schlagzeilen; aber da die
Strukturbedingungen, die zu dieser Moral fuehrten, davon unbetroffen
bleiben, verlieren sich die Schlagzeilen unter den zahllosen anderen
kulturkritischen Kommentaren, einschliesslich derjenigen, die den
Niedergang der Schriftkultur beklagen.

Natuerlich gehoert die Disponibilitaet der Sprache in diesen
Zusammenhang.  Wenn Grundfertigkeiten in unserer schnellebigen Welt
des Umbruchs immer weniger bedeutsam werden, wird auch dem Individuum
immer weniger Gewicht beigemessen.  Unter dem Schlagwort von
Grundfertigkeiten werden junge und weniger junge Arbeiter einer
Ausbildung im Lesen und Schreiben unterzogen, die mit den praktischen
Erfahrungen immer kuerzer werdender Arbeitszyklen immer weniger zu tun
haben.  Auf der Suche nach billigen Arbeitskraeften haben viele
Unternehmen die Vereinigten Staaten entdeckt; hier treffen sie in
weiten Bereichen auf eine Effizienz, die sie unter den aus der
Schriftkultur hervorgegangenen Arbeitsgesetzen ihrer Laender niemals
erreichen koennten.  Mercedes Benz, BMW, Porsche und viele japanische
Unternehmen bilden ihre Arbeitskraefte in South Carolina, Mississippi,
Arkansas und anderen Staaten aus.  Die Einsatzfaehigkeit dieser
Arbeitskraefte ist fast mit der von Maschinen zu vergleichen, wenn
diese Arbeitskraefte nicht ohnehin durch Automatisierung ersetzt
werden.

Der technologische und der menschliche Zyklus sind so eng ineinander
verwoben, dass man von der hybriden Natur der heutigen Technologie
ohne weiteres sagen kann: Maschinen mit einer life-Komponente.  Viele
Maschinen sind nicht mehr uns zu Diensten, sondern wir ihnen.  Unsere
Ausstattung zum Desktop-Publishing auf allerhoechstem Qualitaetsniveau,
zur Datenverarbeitung fuer finanzielle Transaktionen oder zur
Visualisierung wissenschaftlicher Phaenomene erfordert es, dass wir die
Maschinen mit Daten fuettern und das entsprechende Programm fahren,
damit sich ein vernuenftiges Ergebnis einstellt.  Lediglich in solchen
Faellen, in denen die Maschine vielleicht nicht den Unterschied
zwischen guter und schlechter Schrift erkennt, muss der Operator mit
seinem Wissen eingreifen, das immaterielle Faktoren wie Stil, Gefuehl
oder Geschmack umfasst.


Die Skala der Arbeit und die Skala der Sprache

In allen unseren gegenwaertigen und unserer Zeit vorausgegangenen
Handlungsrahmen war es relativ einfach, eine Kontinuitaet von Mitteln,
Methoden und zeitlichen Prozessen herzustellen.  Von groesserem
Interesse sind aber die Diskontinuitaeten.  Wir sehen uns einem
solchen Umbruch ausgesetzt.  Der Gegensatz zwischen der Schriftkultur
und einem Zivilisationsstadium jenseits der Schriftkultur ist dafuer
spuerbarer Ausdruck.  Am unmittelbarsten nehmen wir diesen Umbruch in
seiner Auswirkung auf unsere Identitaetserfahrung im schnellen
wirtschaftlichen Wandel wahr.  Manche Industriezweige verschwinden
gleichsam ueber Nacht.  Viele innovative Ideen schaffen ebenso schnell
neue Arbeit, die allerdings neue Arbeitsbedingungen mit sich bringt.
Dieser Umbruch schlaegt sich nicht nur in Statistiken nieder; er ist
kennzeichnend fuer eine qualitative Veraenderung, die wir an den neuen
Beziehungen zwischen Arbeit und Sprache ablesen koennen.

Eine der Hauptthesen dieses Buches besagt, dass Umbrueche, in der
Theorie dynamischer Systeme auch Phasenverschiebungen genannt, sich
als Skalaveraenderungen aeussern.  Schwellenwerte kennzeichnen die
Herausbildung neuer Zeichenprozesse.  Wir konnten zeigen, wie die
praktischen Erfahrungen, durch die sich der Mensch seiner
Wirklichkeit vergewissert, durch die Skala beeinflusst werden,
innerhalb derer sie sich abspielen.  Ein wesentliches Merkmal der
Menschheitsentwicklung bestand darin, dass mit zunehmender Komplexitaet
der zu loesenden Aufgabe die dafuer notwendige Arbeit geteilt werden
musste.  Doch erst in der fuer unsere Zeit charakteristischen Skala hat
die fortschreitende Arbeitsteilung ihren kritischen Punkt erreicht.
In der Industriegesellschaft und in allen vorausgegangenen
Zivilisationsstadien war die Beziehung zwischen dem Ganzen (Aufgabe,
Ziel, Plan) und seinen Teilen (Teilaufgaben, Teilziele, aufeinander
folgende Planschritte) im Prinzip vom Menschen zu ueberblicken und zu
beherrschen.  Allenthalben erwies sich die Arbeitsteilung als eine
effiziente und erfolgreiche teile-und-herrsche-Strategie fuer die
zunehmende Komplexitaet der sich jeweils stellenden Aufgaben.

Auch die Schriftkultur und die Form der Schriftlichkeit, die selbst
eine Praxis von nicht zu unterschaetzender Komplexitaet darstellen,
erwiesen sich in diesem Prozess als hilfreich, solange die
Differenzierung der Arbeit und das Ausmass der zu leistenden
Integration im Rahmen der schriftkulturellen Komplexitaet lagen.  Ist
deren Komplexitaet allerdings einmal ueberschritten, dann ist es zwar
vielleicht noch vorstellbar, dass die von der Schriftkultur
bereitgestellten Mittel die Reintegration der Teile in das gewuenschte
Ganze leisten, aber das Management dieser Mittel jenseits einer von
uns zu ueberblickenden Komplexitaet liegen wuerde.  Obwohl also die
Schriftkultur auch heute noch in mancherlei Hinsicht leistungsfaehig
ist, erweist sie sich doch gegenueber den vielen von der Sprache
unabhaengigen pragmatischen Ebenen als relativ flach.  Und nicht nur
Schrift und Schriftkultur, auch die hochgelobte menschliche
Intelligenz koennte sich als flach erweisen.

Die veraenderte Bevoelkerungsskala und der damit verbundene Bedarf, der
exponentiell hoeher als jede Erfahrungsbreite eines Individuums ist,
hat zu einer vertieften Segmentierung der Arbeit und damit zu einer
Fuelle von Verschiedenheiten gefuehrt, die von einem einzelnen
Bewusstsein (mind) nicht mehr erfasst werden koennen.  Da aber die
Beschaffenheit eines jeden Bewusstseins (mind) fuer die
Selbstkonstituierung des Menschen von der Interaktion mit anderen
Bewusstseinsformen abhaengig ist, ergibt sich zwangslaeufig die
Notwendigkeit neuer Interaktionsmittel, die sich wesentlich von den
auf Sequentialitaet, Linearitaet und Dualismus bezogenen
Interaktionsmitteln unterscheiden.  Dieses neue Stadium ist nicht
einfach eine Fortschreibung eines vorausgegangenen, und noch weniger
ist es das Ergebnis eines stets wachsenden Fortschrittsprozesses.
Die Erfindung des Rades, an deren Anfang die Verwendung abgerundeter
Steine stand, oeffnete mit anderen an das Rad geknuepften
Erfahrungsformen eine Erneuerungsperspektive.  Die Erfindung des
Hebels leistete AEhnliches, moeglicherweise auch die Erfindung der
Buchstabenschrift und des Zahlensystems.  Deshalb konnte das Alte und
das Neue durch Vergleich, Metaphern und Analogien innerhalb einer
vorgegebenen Skala des Menschen zueinander in Beziehung gesetzt
werden.  Aber aus dem gleichen Grunde haben wir es bei einer
Veraenderung der Skala mit einem Umbruch zu tun, der die UEbersetzung
unserer Erfahrungen in die Sprache der Vergangenheit verbietet.

Ein Auto ist in gewisser Hinsicht Teil des zunehmenden
Fortschrittsprozesses, der mit der Pferdekutsche begann.  Flugzeug
und spaeter Rakete lassen sich schon weniger problemlos in einen
allmaehlichen Veraenderungsprozess einordnen, stehen aber noch immer in
relativer begrifflicher Naehe zu unseren Erfahrungen mit Fliegen und
Voegeln oder mit einer auf Ursache und Wirkung gruendenden Physik.  Ein
Atomkraftwerk hingegen ist jenseits solcher Erfahrungen.  Hier liegt
die Leistung darin, den Prozess zu zaehmen, ihn innerhalb einer Skala
zu halten, die ihn als neue Energiequelle verwendbar macht.  Das
Verhaeltnis zwischen den in diesem Prozess eingebundenen
Groessenordnungen--Materie auf atomarer Ebene im Vergleich zu der
enormen Maschinerie und Architektur--liegt nicht nur jenseits des
Wahrnehmungshorizonts eines individuellen Bewusstseins, sondern auch
jenseits derer, die diese Reaktoren betreiben, wenn sie nicht von
einer enormen Technologie von ebenfalls ausserordentlich hoher
Komplexitaet unterstuetzt wuerden.  Das Schmelzen des
Tschernobyl-Reaktors hat uns die Ungeheuerlichkeit des Vorgangs
demonstriert und zugleich gezeigt, wie bedeutungslos dagegen die in
die Schriftkultur eingebetteten Erfahrungen des traditionellen
Energiemanagements sind.

Die grossen Satelliten--und funktelefonischen Netzwerke, die den
frueher gelaeufigen Begriff des AEthers konkret verkoerpern, bieten ein
neues Beispiel fuer die durch die neue Skala der menschlichen
Taetigkeit bewirkte Skala menschlicher Arbeit; ein Gleiches gilt fuer
die Telefonnetzwerke--mit Kupfer-, Koaxial- oder Glasfaser.  Diese
Netzwerke, die die umfassende Kommunikation von Stimme, Daten und
Bildern mit einer ausgekluegelten Hochleistungstechnologie leisten,
verbieten jeden Vergleich mit Edisons Telefon, mit Briefen oder mit
Videokassetten.  Die Menge der vermittelten Informationen, die
Geschwindigkeit der Vermittlung und die dafuer entwickelten
Synchronisierungsmechanismen erstellen einen Rahmen fuer die
Interaktion zwischen den entlegensten Positionen, der fuer alle
Beteiligten die Zeit neu stellt und jegliche physische Distanz
eliminiert.  Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur haetten mit ihren
Moeglichkeiten solche Ebenen niemals erreichen koennen.

Und schliesslich laesst uns der Computer, allein oder eingebunden in
Netzwerke, die Grenzen unserer Wahrnehmungsfaehigkeit fuer komplexe
Zusammenhaenge in aller Deutlichkeit erkennen.  Die Tatsache, dass ein
Flugzeug etwa 200mal schneller ist als ein Fussgaenger und dass es
300-450 Passagiere einschliesslich deren Gepaeck fassen kann, bereitet
uns offenbar noch keine Probleme.  Der Computerchip hingegen ist eine
geistige Errungenschaft, die jenseits unserer
Verstaendnismoeglichkeiten liegt.  Die Funktionsweise eines digitalen
Computers--sowohl als Ganzes, als auch in allen seinen kleinen mit
vielfaeltigen und komplizierten Funktionen ausgestatteten
Komponenten--gehoert einer Skala an, zu der wir weder intuitiven noch
unmittelbaren Zugang haben.  Computer sind nicht einfach bessere
Rechenmaschinen oder Ladenkassen.  Das Zeitalter des Computers ist
vielmehr gekennzeichnet durch eine semiotische Fokussierung, in der
auf die Sprachverarbeitung der Schriftkultur die Symbolmanipulation
im Computer folgt.

Neben seiner unueberschaubaren Komplexitaet hat der Computer jedoch
auch noch andere Folgen: Er ersetzt die als Kontinuum aufgefasste Welt
durch eine aus verschiedenen diskreten Zustaenden bestehende Welt.
Das koennte auf den ersten Blick nur wie ein qualitativer Unterschied
anmuten, wenn sich die Abkehr von einer aus zusammenhaengenden
Funktionen und monotonem Verhalten bestehenden Welt--was immer auf
Extremfaelle zutrifft, gilt auch fuer alles zwischen den extremen
Polen--nicht konkretisieren wuerde als radikal veraenderte Bedingungen
fuer die identitaetsstiftende praktische Erfahrung.

Die Welt der Schriftkultur ist durch Analogerwartungen gekennzeichnet,
denen zufolge Akkumulation zu Fortschritt fuehrt: Mehr Wissen
(Sprache, Wissenschaft, Kunst) fuehrt zu vermehrten Mitteln
(Ressourcen) und vermehrtem Besitz.  Auch Fleiss und Strebsamkeit--in
allgemeiner oder spezifischer Form--ist Teil dieser analogen
Denkstruktur.  Das Digitale ist seiner Natur nach nicht linear.  Im
digitalen Bereich veraendert eine kleinste Abweichung das
Verarbeitungsresultat so drastisch, dass allein das Auffinden und
Beheben des Fehlers eine neue Erfahrung und oftmals eine neue
Wissensquelle darstellt.

Im geschriebenen Satz wird ein Schreib- oder Druckfehler fast
automatisch korrigiert.  Die Schriftlichkeit gibt uns ein Modell fuer
die Unterscheidung zwischen richtig und falsch in die Hand.  In der
digitalen Welt sind die Sprache des Programms und die Daten, die es
bearbeitet, schwer, wenn ueberhaupt, zu unterscheiden.  Diese
Maschinen koennen Symbole in einer viel groesseren Menge und Vielfalt
verarbeiten als der menschliche Verstand.  Da sie auch nicht die Last
vorangegangener praktischer Erfahrungen zu tragen haben, koennen
solche Maschinen auf potentielle Erfahrungen in einem Bezugsrahmen
hinarbeiten, zu dem Schriftkultur und Schriftlichkeit keinen Zugang
besitzen.  Das Verhalten eines Gegenstandes in einem
multidimensionalen Raum (vier, fuenf, sechs oder noch mehr
Dimensionen), Handlungen in einem regressiven Zeitverlauf oder in
verschiedenen unterschiedlichen und bezugslosen Zeitrahmen oder
Modellierungen, die ueber die Faehigkeit des menschlichen Verstandes
weit hinausgehen--diesen und vielen anderen Phaenomenen, die fuer das
UEberleben und die Weiterentwicklung der Menschheit von unmittelbarer
Bedeutung sind, widmet sich der digitale Computer.  Allerdings, so
koennte man einwenden, formuliert der Computer nicht die Probleme, die
er loest.  Darum geht es aber nicht.  Auch die Schriftkultur hat nicht
die Probleme formuliert, fuer die sie die Antworten lieferte.  Beide
verkoerpern auf ihre Weise Formulierungen und Antworten, die der Skala
entsprechen, der sie zuzuordnen sind.  Die weniger expressive Sprache
aus Nullen und Einsen (ja/nein, offen/geschlossen, weiss/schwarz) ist
dafuer praeziser und fuer die Komplexitaetsebenen unseres neuen
Evolutionsstadiums angemessener.  Die allgemeine Verwendbarkeit des
Computers, die Abstraktionsfaehigkeit des Programms fuer die
Symbolmanipulation und die sehr konkreten Daten, auf die die Arbeit
des Programms bezogen ist, stellen eine leistungsfaehige Verknuepfung
aus verdinglichtem Wissen, effektiven Prozeduren fuer Problemloesungen
und hohen Analysefaehigkeiten dar.  Diejenigen, die im Computer nur
eine wichtige technologische Metapher unserer Zeit sehen, verkennen
den durch ihn hervorgerufenen und ermoeglichten neuen Rhythmus unserer
Lebenspraxis und die Rolle, die der Computer eingenommen hat, in dem
Masse wie sich die Grenzen unseres Verstandes offenbart haben (so wie
der Mensch in der industriellen Gesellschaft die Grenzen seiner
koerperlichen Leistungsfaehigkeit erfahren musste).

Edsger Dijkstra hat fuer den Umgang mit dem radikal Neuen einen
methodischen Ansatz vorgeschlagen, in dessen Mittelpunkt "die
Schaffung und das Erlernen einer neuen fremden Sprache steht, die
nicht in irgendeine der bestehenden Muttersprachen uebersetzt werden
kann."  Dieser Vorschlag deutet in die richtige Richtung, geht aber
nicht weit genug.  Den radikalen Umbruch werden wir nur dann in den
Griff bekommen, wenn wir akzeptieren, dass Schriftkultur und
schriftkulturelle Bildung ihre Grenzen erreicht haben und an ihre
Stelle die Illiteralitaet, der Analphabetismus der zahllosen
Spezialsprachen tritt, die fuer unsere Selbstkonstituierung in den
neuen Lebensumstaenden erforderlich sind.  Dieser Abriss der
gegenwaertigen Veraenderungen mag zu neuer Verwirrung fuehren.  In dem,
was wir ueblicherweise eine zivilisierte Gesellschaft nennen, hat
bislang die Sprache als Einheitswaehrung fuer kulturellen Austausch
gegolten.  Werden nun die hoeheren Effizienzgrade und Erwartungen, die
den Markt und die Technologie antreiben, ihrerseits die neuen, von
ihnen geschaffenen Kommunikationsmittel untergraben?  Wird unsere
Sprache in einer ihrer neuen, nicht schriftkulturellen Verkoerperung,
wenn sie mit dem exponentiellen Informationswachstum nicht mehr
Schritt halten kann, sich ebenfalls einer Umstrukturierung
unterziehen muessen?  Werden wir eine voellig neue Art von Symbolen
entwickeln oder irgendeine Art von Vorverarbeitung, bevor die
Informationen an den Menschen vermittelt werden?  Alle diese Fragen
bleiben aber auf die Arbeit bezogen, auf die Arbeit als die
Erfahrungsform, aus der sich die menschliche Identitaet gemeinsam mit
den menschlichen Produkten, die den Stempel dieser Identitaet tragen,
ergibt.

Die aktive Rolle, die jedes Zeichensystem ausuebt, ist durchaus
vergleichbar mit der Funktion von Werkzeugen.  Die Hand, die einen
Stein wirft, wird von diesem auch "getroffen", d. h. beeinflusst.
Hebel, Haemmer, Zangen, Teleskope, Fuellhalter, Automaten und Computer
unterstuetzen unsere praktischen Erfahrungen, wirken sich aber
gleichzeitig auf die Individuen aus, die sich durch ihren Gebrauch in
der Welt konstituieren.  Eine Geste, ein geschriebenes Zeichen, ein
Laut, eine Koerperbewegung, geschriebene oder gelesene Woerter druecken
uns aus oder tragen unsere AEusserungen weiter und wirken sich
gleichzeitig auf diejenigen aus, die sich im Gebrauch dieser Zeichen
als Menschen konstituieren.  Der Einfluss der Sprache auf die Arbeit
ist daher gleichbedeutend mit dem Einfluss, den Sprache innerhalb
eines gegebenen pragmatischen Rahmens auf den Menschen ausuebt.  Um
einige Aspekte dieses aeusserst schwierigen Problems zu erhellen,
wollen wir die synkretistische Natur des Menschen etwas naeher
betrachten.


Angeborene Heuristik

Begriffliche Werkzeuge, die auf den Menschen in seiner
synkretistischen Natur abzielen, existieren nur in dem Masse, in dem
wir sie in der Sprache identifizieren koennen.  In jedem uns bekannten
System stehen Vielfalt und Praezision in einem komplementaeren
Verhaeltnis.  Was immer die Menschen tun, ihre Bemuehungen sind darauf
gerichtet, ihre Leistungen zu optimieren.  Zu viele Einzelheiten
beeintraechtigen die Effizienz, ungenuegende Genauigkeit beeintraechtigt
das Ergebnis.  Es gibt offenbar zwischen dem Was und dem Wie eine
strukturale Relation der Art eins : viele.  Wo immer uns
Effizienzueberlegungen dazu anhalten, die Wahl zwischen mehreren
Moeglichkeiten zu treffen, wird diese Relation durchgespielt.  Das
Optimale ist immer das, was sich nach bestem Wissen als das fuer das
Erreichen des Ziels am besten geeignete Mittel erweist.  Zugleich ist
ein solches Optimum kennzeichnend fuer die Pragmatik eines jeweiligen
Kontexts.  Jagd kann z. B. allein oder in Gruppen durchgefuehrt
werden, mit Steinen, Speeren, Pfeilen oder Fallen.

Der primitive synkretistische Mensch war (und ist in gegenwaertigen
primitiven Kulturen noch immer) in eine praktische Erfahrung
eingebunden, die er als Ganzheit erfuhr: natuerliche Veranlagung,
Beziehung zur natuerlichen Umwelt, erlernte Faehigkeiten und Wissen,
Gefuehle (wie Furcht, Freude, Trauer).  Der spezialisierte Mensch
konstituiert sich in partiellen Erfahrungen.  Gemeinsam ist beiden
gleichwohl die natuerliche Bedingung ihres Handelns.  Der Unterschied
zwischen beiden liegt in den entwickelten UEberlebens- und
Selbsterhaltungsstrategien, die von unmittelbaren Beduerfnissen und
direktem Handeln zu vermenschlichten Beduerfnissen und vermittelter
Handlung verlaufen.  Eine begrenzte Menge von Optionen (etwa der Art
"wenn hungrig, such Nahrung") wird ersetzt durch eine Vielfalt von
Optionen, die schliesslich zu der den Menschen eigenen heuristischen
Natur fuehrt.  Homo sapiens ist mithin dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass er
nach Optionen sucht.  Der Mensch ist kreativ und effizient.

Es mag sein, dass die menschliche Sprache angeboren ist (wie Chomsky
glaubt).  Fuer die heuristische Dimension des Menschen gilt dies ganz
gewiss.  Die Auswahl der Mittel (die Bestimmung des Wie) laesst auf das
erstrebte Ziel schliessen und auch auf das Bewusstsein von dem, was
moeglich ist, sowie das Bemuehen, den Bereich des Moeglichen zu
erweitern.  Das eigentliche Bestreben liegt nicht darin, die
Lebensumstaende unveraendert zu lassen, sondern den Bereich der
Moeglichkeiten zu erweitern und mehr als nur das UEberleben zu
garantieren.  Dieses Bemuehen nennen wir gemeinhin Fortschritt.

Unser einleitender kurzer UEberblick ueber die Geschichte der Schrift
hat gezeigt, dass die gleiche heuristische Strategie der Entwicklung
der Schriftkultur zugrundeliegt.  Vor der Entwicklung unseres
Alphabets in seiner heutigen Form gab es eine Reihe weniger optimaler
Schriftsysteme, deren konkrete Natur nur eine eingeschraenkte
Expressivitaet erlaubte.  Alle Sprachalphabete in ihrer heutigen Form
gingen aus einer langen Geschichte hervor, deren wesentliche
Antriebskraft das Streben nach Optimierung war: Arbeitspraxis
beeinflusste die Ausdrucksweise, die Ausdrucksweise schuf neue Rahmen
fuer die Arbeitspraxis, und gemeinsam entwickelten sich auf diese
Weise Erklaerungsmodelle fuer die Welt.  Das Was und das Wie im Bereich
der Sprachhandlung besass urspruenglich einen Komplexitaetsgrad, der dem
Komplexitaetsgrad der in ihr zum Ausdruck gebrachten Handlungen
entsprach.  Im Verlauf ihrer Entwicklung gewannen die Sprachen
jeweils die Komplexitaet der heuristischen Erfahrung, waehrend die
Handlungsformen einfacher wurden.

In solchen Vermittlungsmechanismen, die von einem hoeheren
Abstraktionsgrad als die Sprache sind, erreichte die Dimension des
Was und des Wie eine noch groessere Komplexitaet.  Diese spiegelte sich
in dem Unterschied wider, der zwischen der Groessenordnung der
menschlichen Arbeit und derjenigen des Ergebnisses bestand,
insbesondere in den bereitgestellten Wahlmoeglichkeiten.  In dem Masse,
in dem der Mensch als Individuum seine synkretistische Natur
preisgeben musste, verzeichnen wir als Parallelentwicklung die
Entstehung eines kompositen Synkretismus der Lebensgemeinschaft.
Eine relativ stabile individuelle Ganzheit wurde durch eine auf die
Lebensgemeinschaft bezogene, sich gleichwohl immer schneller
veraendernde Ganzheit ersetzt.  Die Spracherfahrungen waren in diese
Verlagerung einbezogen.  Der Mensch, der sich durch den
Sprachgebrauch in der Welt konstituierte, erkannte seine soziale
Dimension, welche ja ihrerseits ein Beispiel fuer die im Verlauf
seiner Entwicklung erreichte Ausdifferenzierung seiner Optionen ist.

Die heuristische Natur des Menschen aeusserte sich in dem Augenblick,
in dem sich die UEberlebensstrategien des Menschen aus ihrer
unmittelbaren Bindung an die natuerlichen Zyklen loesten: Wenn sich z.
B. die Zahl der Tiere, die auf eine bestimmte Beute Jagd machen,
erhoeht, so wird die gejagte Gruppe entweder neue UEberlebensstrategien
suchen oder in einem absehbaren Zeitraum nicht mehr als Nahrung zur
Verfuegung stehen.  Der Mensch hingegen verfolgte andere Strategien.
Statt sich auf wenige Methoden der Nahrungsversorgung zu
konzentrieren, diversifizierte er seine praktischen Erfahrungen der
Selbstkonstituierung und des UEberlebens und erschloss sich vielfaeltige
Ressourcen.  Der homo habilis entwickelte in einem praeagrikulturellen
Handlungsrahmen mannigfaltige Formen der Jagd, der Fischerei, der
Nahrungsmittelsuche.  Waehrend das begrenzte Nahrungsangebot bei allen
anderen Gattungen drastische Wachstumskontrollen zur Folge hatte,
entwickelte allein der Mensch eine Faehigkeit, die Palette seiner
Ressourcen zu erweitern.  Im Verlauf dieser Entwicklung wurde das
menschliche Wesen zu einem arbeitenden Wesen, und die Arbeit wurde
zum eigentlichen Wesensmerkmal der Gattung.

Spracherwerb und der UEbergang von den natuerlichen Erfahrungen der
Selbstkonstituierungen im UEberlebenskampf zu den praktischen
Erfahrungen in der Arbeit verlaufen parallel.  Mit jeder neuen Skala,
in der sich der Mensch wiederfand, entfernten sich die menschlichen
Arbeitsablaeufe von dem einfachen Muster von Aktion/Reaktion.  Wir
haben in verschiedenen Zusammenhaengen gezeigt, dass sich mit der
Entwicklung von Zeichenverwendung zu fruehen Sprachformen und von
fruehen Sprachformen zu fest etablierten sprachlichen Ausdrucksmitteln
die Skala der Menschheit erweitert und sich eine Grundstruktur der
Lebenspraxis durchgesetzt hat, die mit Sequentialitaet, Linearitaet,
Determinismus und Zentralismus einen neuen pragmatischen
Handlungsrahmen setzte.

Die Schriftfaehigkeit wurde relativ spaet erworben und ergab sich aus
dem Prozess der Arbeitsteilung.  Dieser Prozess war seinerseits
gebunden an die Diversifikation der Ressourcen und praktischen
Erfahrungen, die den Synkretismus auf der Ebene der
Lebensgemeinschaft bewahrte.  Nicht jeder schrieb, nicht jeder las.
Der neue Handlungsrahmen erforderte Ordnungsprinzipien, Methoden der
Aufgabenverteilung und der UEberpruefung der Aufgaben, einen gewissen
Zentralismus und, vor allem, Organisationsformen, die weitgehend von
der Religion und den Regierungsinstanzen gestaltet wurden.  Unter
diesen Bedingungen galt alles als Arbeit, was die Identitaetsfindung,
das UEberleben, die Veraenderung und den Fortschritt der menschlichen
Gattung foerderte.  Das drueckte sich in dem Masse in Sprache aus, in
dem es ausgedrueckt werden musste.  Mit anderen Worten: Auch die
Sprache ist Teil des menschlichen Bemuehens, Optionen und Ressourcen
zu diversifizieren.

Eine begrenzte Vermittlung durch Sprache und Schriftlichkeit wurde
noetig, um die Abstimmung von Beduerfnissen und Moeglichkeiten zu
optimieren.  Die Vermittlung nahm dabei ihrerseits den Charakter von
Arbeit an.  Fragen waren zu stellen und zu beantworten,
Verpflichtungen waren einzugehen, AEquivalenzen herzustellen.  Alle
Taetigkeiten waren darauf ausgerichtet, die verfuegbaren Ressourcen zu
nutzen und durch neue zu ergaenzen.  Die jeweiligen Zeichenprozesse
mussten mit der jeweiligen Entwicklung der Produktivitaet, der
Verfuegbarkeit von Ressourcen und dem daran geknuepften Planungsbedarf
Schritt halten.  Die Einfuehrung des Geldes markierte z. B. die
naechste abstraktere Vermittlungsebene, die die unmittelbaren
Lebensbeduerfnisse in eine vergleichende Skala von Massnahmen
uebersetzte, die diese Beduerfnisse befriedigen konnte.  Der
Zusammenhang, in dem sich Warentausch abspielte, fuehrte zur
Verwendung des Geldes, welches spaeter selbst zu einer Ressource,
einer Ware auf hoechster Ebene wurde.  Wie jede Vermittlungsform
entwickelte auch das Geld eine eigene Sprache.  Mit dem Aufkommen von
universellen Austauschmitteln, wie Sprache eines ist, entwickelten
sich das Was und das Wie der menschlichen Taetigkeit noch weiter
auseinander.  Direkter Handel nahm indirekte Formen an.  Die
Beduerfnisse wurden nicht mehr durch die zufaelligen Angebote eines
Marktes gestillt.  Der Markt verwandelte sich zunehmend in ein
Organisationsmittel, fuer dessen Ablaeufe und fuer dessen Erweiterung
die Sprache zu Diensten war.  In diesen Formen des Marktes war
Sprache noch immer rudimentaer, direkt, muendlich, an den unmittelbaren
Ausdruck gebunden und oft genug in dem Augenblick verbraucht, in dem
sich die Ressource oder die Option erschoepft hatte (sofern keine
Alternative entwickelt wurde).  Das gilt auch heute noch.

Spaeter erst entwickelte die Sprache ihre Moeglichkeiten, Sachverhalte
aufzuzeichnen, Transaktionen auszufuehren, Plaene zu entwickeln und
neue Erfahrungsbereiche zu erschliessen.  Die Logik dieser Sprachform
objektivierte gewissermassen die Logik der menschlichen Taetigkeit.
Sie ergaenzte die angeborene heuristische Veranlagung des Menschen.
Die Interaktionsformen des Marktes und die zunehmenden
Effizienzerwartungen verliehen der menschlichen Taetigkeit
vermitteltere Formen.  In jenen lange zurueckliegenden Zeiten, in
denen die ersten Sprachformen Kontur gewannen, vermehrte sich die
Zahl der Werkzeuge, bis schliesslich diese Werkzeuge zusammen mit
anderen Hervorbringungen des Menschen ueber ihre Funktion als
Hilfsmittel hinaus ihrerseits zu Handelsobjekten wurden.  Als
vermittelndes Element zwischen dem Hersteller und dem Hergestellten
war das Werkzeug Arbeitsmittel und zugleich Ziel: Bessere Werkzeuge
erforderten eine Unterweisung derer, die sie benutzten.  Der
angemessene Gebrauch wiederum erhoehte die Effizienz der Arbeit und
den Markterfolg der Produkte.  Bei der Ausfaecherung der praktischen
Erfahrungen spielten diese Werkzeuge eine aehnliche Rolle wie bei der
Erweiterung der Lebenserhaltungsgrundlagen.  Die Mittel, mit denen
Werkzeuge und andere menschliche Produkte geschaffen wurden, liessen
weitere Sprachen, etwa das Zeichnen, entstehen, auf welche die fruehen
Formen der Technik zurueckgreifen konnten.  In diesem Zusammenhang
muessen wir an eine bereits getroffene wichtige Feststellung erinnern:
Kein Werkzeug wird einfach nur benutzt.  Der Benutzer passt sich den
Bedingungen der Benutzung, dem Werkzeug, an und wird in gewisser
Weise selbst zum Benutzten, zum Werkzeug des Werkzeugs.  Das gilt
gerade auch fuer Sprache, Schrift und Schriftkultur.  Sie wurden
entwickelt zur Optimierung der menschlichen Lebenspraxis.  Aber die
Menschen haben sich auch den Zwaengen der von ihnen ersonnenen
Erfindung unterworfen.

Am Anfang der Schriftkultur fuehrte die Spannung zwischen einer
erzwungenen schriftlichen Praezision--die Naehe der Sprache zum
Gegenstand, die sprachliche Benennung nur solcher Gegenstaende, die
auch Piktogramme darstellen koennten--und einer relativ breit
gefaecherten muendlichen Sprache zu Konflikten zwischen den Verfechtern
der Schrift und den Huetern der Muendlichkeit (wie wir es an den
verschiedenen Positionen griechischer Philosophen ablesen konnten).
Das Geschriebene musste vom Gegenstand genauso befreit werden wie der
Mensch von einer bestimmten Quelle fuer Proteine oder Nahrungsmittel.
Es musste zu allgemeineren Ausdrucksformen finden und auf Familien,
Typen, Klassen usw. von Gegenstaenden verweisen koennen.  Muendlichkeit
musste gezaehmt und mit Schriftlichkeit in Einklang gebracht werden.
Und dieser Zaehmungsprozess konnte sich nur durch Arbeit und durch
soziale Interaktion vollziehen.  Alle menschlichen Bemuehungen, das
aus der Arbeit gewonnene Wissen in entsprechende Gegenstaende
umzusetzen (die das Messen, die Orientierung oder die Navigation
erleichterten), legen hierfuer ein Zeugnis ab.  Die phonetische
Schrift als Fortentwicklung der menschlichen Bemuehungen zur
Optimierung der Schrift konnte die muendliche Sprache besser nachahmen.
Persoenliche Merkmale, die das Muendliche expressiv gestalteten, und
soziale Merkmale, die das Geschriebene mit Merkmalen versahen, die
sie naeher an das Gesprochene heranfuehrten, werden durch das
phonetische System unterstuetzt.  Das theokratische System der
Piktographen und die von anderen als demokratisch bezeichnete Sprache
der phonetischen Schrift verdienen ihre Namen nur dann, wenn wir
beide Sprache als konstitutiv und repraesentativ fuer die menschliche
Erfahrung verstehen.  Undifferenzierte Arbeit ist theokratisch.  Ihre
Gesetze ergeben sich aus dem, was Gegenstand der praktischen
Erfahrung ist.  Geteilte Arbeit ist trotz ihrer Auswirkungen auf die
Integritaet derer, die nur einen kleinen Teil des gesamten
Arbeitsprozesses ausmachen, ihrer Natur nach partizipatorisch in dem
Sinne, dass ihre Ergebnisse von der Leistung eines jeden in diesen
Arbeitsprozess eingebundenen Menschen abhaengen.  Ausuebung und
Erfahrung von Sprache und Ausuebung und Erfahrung von geteilter Arbeit
sind wesensmaessig miteinander verbunden und entsprechen dem
pragmatischen Rahmen jener menschlichen Skala, aus der sie
hervorgingen.  Arbeitsteilung und die Bindung von sehr abstrakten
phonetischen Einheiten an sehr konkrete Formen der Versprachlichung
menschlicher Erfahrung bedingen sich gegenseitig.


Alternativen

Zur Erklaerung der Veraenderungen, die von einer allumfassenden
Schriftkultur zu einem Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur gefuehrt
haben, rekurrierten wir auf das malthusianische Prinzip (die
Bevoelkerung waechst geometrisch an, die Quellen fuer Nahrungsmittel
hingegen arithmetisch).  Nicht in Betracht allerdings zog Malthus die
heuristische Natur des Menschen, d. h. die zunehmende Umsetzung des
kreativen Potentials dieser Gattung, das nicht nur seine eigene Natur
bewahrt, sondern kraft dieser Kreativitaet eine eigene
nicht-natuerliche Natur schafft.  Im Prozess seiner
Selbstkonstituierung schafft der Mensch die Mittel fuer sein UEberleben
und fuer zukuenftiges Wachstum jenseits der Zirkularitaet einfacher
UEberlebensstrategien.  Henry George hat im vergangenen Jahrhundert
diesen Umstand in einem Vergleich zwischen Raubvoegeln und Menschen
verdeutlicht: Beide Spezies essen Huehner; aber eine Zunahme von
Raubvoegeln wuerde zu einer Verringerung der Zahl von Huehnern fuehren,
waehrend ein Bevoelkerungswachstum zu einem Zuwachs der Zahl von
Huehnern fuehrt.  Obwohl dieses Beispiel viele andere Faktoren, die fuer
das Aussterben von Gattungen oder fuer die Zahlenverhaeltnisse von
Tieren und Menschen verantwortlich sind, ausser acht laesst, verweist es
doch auf einen wesentlichen Aspekt der menschlichen Gattung, der mit
eben dieser erwaehnten Kreativitaet und einer erweiterten Skala der
menschlichen Taetigkeit zu tun hat, aus der heraus die Schriftkultur
notwendig erwuchs.

Auch zu der Zeit, als George sein Beispiel formulierte, zeichneten
sich Probleme ab, die dem malthusianischen Gesetz zu entsprechen
schienen.  Holz, Kohle und OEl als Brennstoff fuer Lampen wurden
zunehmend knapper, so wie wir heute einer Erschoepfung vieler unserer
Ressourcen (Mineralien, Energie- und Nahrungsmittelressourcen, Wasser
usw.) befuerchten muessen.  Diejenigen, die das Versiegen solcher
Ressourcen verkuenden, uebersehen die Tatsache, dass der Mensch bei
allen vorangegangenen Verknappungen Alternativen entwickelte, die er
in neue praktische Erfahrungen integrieren konnte.  Als im 16.
Jahrhundert in England das Holz knapp wurde, entdeckte man die Kohle;
im 19. Jahrhundert wurde Kerosin fuer die Beleuchtung nutzbar gemacht
(1859); weitere Kohlevorraete wurden entdeckt; man entwickelte
Maschinen mit geringerem Energieverbrauch und zur effizienteren
Kohlegewinnung; verschiedene Industriezweige stellten sich auf andere
Mineralien ein.  Die strenge Abhaengigkeit von jahreszeitlichen Zyklen
und vom Getreide- und Gemueseanbau wurde zunehmend durch neue
Techniken zur Verarbeitung und Lagerung von Lebensmitteln ersetzt.
Die neue Lebenspraxis des 19. Jahrhunderts weist die strukturalen
Merkmale einer erweiterten Skala der Menschheit auf.  Diese betrifft
die Natur der menschlichen Arbeit und die Natur der
gesellschaftlichen, politischen und staatlichen Organisation
innerhalb der sich damals herausbildenden Nationalstaaten.  Im
Rueckblick auf die Dynamik des Wachstums und die Verfuegbarkeit von
Ressourcen zeigt sich heute, dass mit der Entwicklung von Sprache, von
Schreiben und Lesen und schliesslich mit der Entwicklung von
Schriftkultur und Bildung sowie durch die ausserhalb der Sprache
liegende Technik ein lebenspraktischer Zusammenhang eingerichtet
wurde, der die zunehmende Unausgeglichenheit zwischen
Bevoelkerungswachstum und Ressourcen ausgleichen konnte.

Unsere heutige Zeit ist in mehrfacher Hinsicht Ausdruck eines
Zeichenprozesses, dessen Wurzeln tief in den pragmatischen
Zusammenhang zurueckreichen, in dem die Schrift entstand.  Heute sind
Technik und Technologie vorherrschend.  Wenn wir diesen Zeichenprozess
von Technik und Technologie, also die Entwicklung des Verhaeltnisses
zwischen an Technik und Technologie gebundener Arbeit und der Sprache,
beschreiben wollen, stossen wir sowohl auf Kontinuitaet--in Form
sukzessiver Reproduktion--und auf Diskontinuitaet--in der
grundsaetzlich neuen Natur der gegenwaertigen technischen und
technologischen Arbeit.  Wir koennen uns dabei sowohl auf die
Verbreitung des auf dem phoenizischen Alphabet gruendenden
Schriftsystems beziehen als auch auf die Sprache des Zeichnens, die
die Entwicklung der Technik beguenstigte.

Phoenizische Haendler lieferten Materialien an die Minoer.  In der
minoischen Bestattungskultur war es ueblich, den Bestatteten wertvolle
Gegenstaende, die den Leistungsstand der damaligen Handwerkskunst
widerspiegelten, mit ins Grab zu geben.  Diese Gegenstaende wurden aus
Silber, Gold, Zinn und Blei hergestellt.  Aufgrund der gesteigerten
Nachfrage nach solchen Metallen war der Markt allmaehlich erschoepft.
Auf der Suche nach diesem Handelsgut mussten die phoenizischen Haendler
immer weitere Wege gehen und bessere Werkzeuge zum Abbau und zur
Vorverarbeitung der Mineralien entwickeln.  Schrift und Zeichnungen
waren in diesen Prozess der Kompensation zwischen Beduerfnissen und
verfuegbaren Ressourcen eingebunden, und die fortwaehrende Suche nach
neuen Ressourcen fuehrte automatisch zur Verbreitung von Schrift und
Handwerk: Wir muessen diesen Vorgang mithin als Teil der Dynamik
bestimmter Wirtschaftsraeume sehen.

Wir koennen nur im Rueckblick die Frage beantworten, bis zu welchem
Punkt diese die schriftkulturellen und technischen Fertigkeiten
einbeziehenden Kompensationshandlungen effektiv waren und wann sie
ihren Hoehepunkt erreichten, der vermutlich irgendwann im Zeitalter
der industriellen Revolution liegt.  Gibt es einen Zeitpunkt, in dem
die Waagschale zugunsten der technischen Ausdrucks- und
Kommunikationsmittel ausschlug?  Wenn dies so ist, koennen wir ihn
nicht naeher bezeichnen.  Als sich aber das Potential der
Schriftkultur zur Unterstuetzung der menschlichen
Selbstkonstituierungserfahrungen in einem neuen pragmatischen
Zusammenhang erschoepft hatte, wurden neue Mittel notwendig.  Ziel des
vorliegenden Buches ist es, die Dynamik dieses Umbruchs zu erklaeren.
Dazu gehoert gewiss die Technologie, aber nicht als Ursache, sondern
eher als Ergebnis der neuen Dynamik.

Der maechtige Strom der breit ausgefaecherten Erfahrungen, der durch
zahlreiche neue Sprachen einschliesslich der Sprache des Designs und
der Technik befoerdert wurde, fuehrte zu einem verstaerkten Bewusstwerden
von der Bedeutung der Vermittlung, die ihrerseits ein Ziel an sich
wurde.


Vermittlung der Vermittlung

Wir wollen den Verlauf unserer Argumentation an dieser Stelle fuer
einen Augenblick unterbrechen und uns die Folgen vergegenwaertigen,
die die nachgezeichnete Entwicklung fuer die Gegenwart mit sich bringt.
Wir haben gesehen, wie die Formen des jeweiligen Marktes die
allgemeine Struktur des menschlichen Handelns spiegelten und wie
dieses sich in der Natur der an die jeweiligen Entwicklungsstadien
gebundenen Sprache ausdrueckte.  Wir haben ferner gesehen, wie von
einem gewissen Entwicklungsstadium an der Mensch Werkzeuge als
Erweiterung seiner koerperlichen und geistigen Funktionen verwendete.
Heute erleben wir, wie durch die Einschaltung von elektronisch,
pneumatisch, hydraulisch oder thermisch uebermittelten Anweisung eine
Vermittlung der Vermittlung stattfindet.  Ein Knopfdruck, die
Bewegung eines Hebels, die Bedienung eines Keyboards oder die
Ausloesung eines Relais setzen vollkommen durchprogrammierte
Aktivitaeten in Gang und fuehren zu weiterfuehrenden
Vermittlungsprozessen.  Zwischen Hand oder Koerperteil--die diese
Prozesse ausloesen--und dem verarbeiteten Material sind vielfaeltige
Verarbeitungsmechanismen und Zeichenfolgen zur Kontrolle geschaltet.
Unsere auf Arbeit, Religion, Erziehung, Dichtung und Marktvorgaenge
ausgerichtete Sprache wird neu strukturiert.  Es entstehen neue
Sprachebenen und neue, begrenzte, auf spezifische Funktionen
ausgerichtete Sprachen, mittels derer diese Vermittlungsprozesse
ablaufen.  Die Sprache des Zeichenbretts oder allgemeiner die Sprache
des Designs gehoert dazu.  Und es entstehen neue Beziehungen zwischen
den verschiedenen Sprachebenen und den neuentwickelten
Spezialsprachen.

In welchem Bezug steht nun dieser Vorgang zu der angeborenen
heuristischen Natur des Menschen und zu unserer These, dass sich die
Skala der menschlichen Taetigkeit nachhaltig veraendert?  Wir koennen
die von uns beobachteten Veraenderungen nicht mehr einfach damit
erklaeren, dass die technologische Umsetzung wissenschaftlicher
Erkenntnisse hoehere Effizienzebenen erreicht und damit zu einer
minderen Bedeutung der Schriftkultur gefuehrt hat.  Das
Bevoelkerungswachstum und die Dynamik der Diversifikation (mehr
Optionen, vermehrte Ressourcen) hat in der neuen Skala eine
vollkommen andere Dimension erreicht.  Es ist fast irrelevant
geworden, dass in den grossen Industrielaendern manch eine traditionelle
Ressource aufgebraucht worden ist.  Denn selbst bei den staendig
kleiner werdenden Flaechen zur landwirtschaftlichen Nutzung in der
westlichen Welt nehmen der Pro-Kopf-Verbrauch an Nahrungsmitteln und
die Verschiedenartigkeit des Angebots substantiell zu.  In der
Auseinandersetzung mit den traditionellen, sich ebenfalls
erschoepfenden Praxisformen der Schriftkultur haben wir mittlerweile
Mittel entwickelt, die uns dadurch gesetzten Grenzen zu ueberschreiten
und unter Einbeziehung von globalen Dimensionen, Konfigurationen,
Nichtlinearitaet und vielwertiger Logik neue Produkte hervorzubringen,
die der neuen Lage angemessen sind.

Wir haben gelernt, unsere Kreativitaet auf die Erschliessung neuer
Ressourcen zu richten und unsere Beduerfnisse und Moeglichkeiten aus
einer neuen Perspektive zu betrachten.  Wir duerfen allerdings
Globalitaet nicht mit dem japanischen Sushi-Restaurant in der Provence,
mit MacDonald’s in Moskau oder Peking, mit multinationalen
Unternehmen oder mit Investitionen im Ausland verwechseln.
Globalitaet bedeutet vielmehr, dass wir weltweit die gleichen
Ressourcen teilen und unsere kreative Energie auf deren Vermehrung
richten muessen, unabhaengig von den uns durch Sprache, Kultur, Staat
oder Allianzen gesetzten Grenzen.  Dieser Umstand hat neben den
ungeheuren Moeglichkeiten, die er bietet, auch ein haessliches Gesicht.
Um den Zugang zu wichtigen Ressourcen zu sichern und die Maerkte offen
zu halten, wuerde die Welt selbst vor einem Krieg nicht
zurueckschrecken (wie sie es immer wieder gezeigt hat).  Aber diese
haessliche Seite der Medaille praegt nicht unsere effektive Lebenspraxis
und bestimmt auch nicht die Bedingungen, unter denen wir uns in
dieser Welt mit ihrer neuen Dynamik und unseren neuen Erwartungen
setzen.

Unter den neuen Arbeitsformen jenseits der Schriftkultur haben sich
die alten Arbeitsformen wie Jagd und Fischen zu Sportarten und
Freizeituebungen gewandelt, und der Sammlerinstinkt des Menschen ist z.
B. in den Vereinigten Staaten so degeneriert, dass manch einer gar
nicht mehr weiss, dass in unseren Waeldern Pilze, Beeren und Nuesse als
Nahrungsmittel wachsen.  Auch die Landwirtschaft, vermutlich die
dauerhafteste Form der praktischen Erfahrung, befreit sich von den
durch die Natur vorgegebenen Strukturen und nimmt industrielle
Dimensionen an, die sich mit vielen technologischen Mitteln dem
jahreszeitlichen Ablauf entziehen.  Globale Dimensionen hat auch
unser Umgang mit Ressourcen und der Umwelt, haben Kommunikation,
Transport und Technologie, hat vor allem aber der Markt angenommen.
All das zeigt uns, dass wir die Veraenderungen nicht auf eine Erfindung
oder eine Verhaltensweise zurueckfuehren koennen, sondern auf die
veraenderten Bedingungen der menschlichen Erfahrung, die letztendlich
auch das menschliche Individuum veraendern wird.

Viele Arbeitsformen verlaufen heute ohne menschliche Kontrolle.  Der
Mensch als Betreiber von Programmen und Maschinen wurde ersetzt durch
eine Technologie, deren Effizienz- und Sicherheitsstandard jenseits
des menschlichen Fassungsvermoegens liegen.  Damit sind viele dieser
Arbeitsformen aber auch von den Fesseln der Sprache befreit,
insbesondere von denen der Schriftkultur.  Maschinen muessen keine
Rechtschreibung, Grammatik oder Syntaxregeln lernen.  Noch weniger
muss zwischen Mensch und Maschine eine vermittelnde Instanz der
Schriftlichkeit und Schriftkultur eingeschaltet werden, die nicht nur
ineffizient und mehrdeutig ist, sondern durch die verschiedenen
religioesen, politischen und ideologischen Verwendungen, die sie im
Verlauf der vergangenen Jahrhunderte genommen hat, belastet ist.  Die
neuen Sprachen, ob als Interface zwischen Maschinen oder zwischen
Menschen und Maschinen, sind nur begrenzt einsetzbar und nicht auf
Bestand hin konzipiert.  Fuer die Dynamik der Arbeitswelt sind diese
neuen Sprachen gut aufeinander abgestimmt.  Insgesamt wird unsere
Taetigkeit schneller, praeziser, segmentierter, arbeitsteiliger und
zugleich komplexer.  Sie unterliegt einer mehrwertigen Effizienzlogik,
nicht mehr der dualistischen Logik von wahr und falsch.

Man koennte aus dieser Darstellung moeglicherweise ein Votum gegen die
zahlreichen oekologischen Bewegungen und fuer Technokratie, fuer
grenzenloses Wachstum oder fuer die Planung von Wunderwelten ablesen.
Nichts davon trifft zu.  Ich moechte lediglich versuchen, ein
Verstehens- und Handlungsmodell zu entwerfen, das die Komplexitaet
unseres Problems ernst nimmt und nicht verniedlicht, wie es die
simplifizierenden Modelle der Schriftkultur oft getan haben.



Kapitel 3:


Schriftkultur, Bildung und Ausbildung

Bildung, Ausbildung und Schriftkultur haengen eng zusammen.  Das eine
ist ohne das andere nicht denkbar.  Andererseits hat es auch vor der
Schrift Erziehung gegeben, und es gibt Formen der Erziehung, die
nicht auf Schriftlichkeit beruhen, oder zumindest nicht
ausschliesslich.  Wir sollten bei unseren UEberlegungen, welche
Faktoren Bildung und Ausbildung auf Schriftlichkeit gegruendet haben
und welche Folgen sich daraus fuer ihre gegenseitige Abhaengigkeit
ergeben, diese Zusammenhaenge nicht ganz aus dem Auge verlieren.

Wie viele andere Einrichtungen, die die Merkmale schriftkultureller
Erfahrungen tragen, ist auch der gegenwaertige Stand des
Bildungswesens alles andere als ideal.  Mit der Schriftkultur setzte
sich im Bereich der Erziehung das Ideal von Dauerhaftigkeit und
Bestand fest.  Wir haben gesehen, dass die Schriftkultur fuer eine
Entwicklungsphase, mit der sich viele von uns noch immer eindeutig
identifizieren, das richtige Ziel und ein angemessenes Mittel war.
Innerhalb dieser Struktur hatten Erziehung und Ausbildung die Aufgabe,
optimale Formen der sozialen Interaktion zu foerdern und an Werten
auszurichten, die in der Sprache zum Ausdruck kamen.  Die in der
Schriftkultur verankerte Erziehung bezog sich auf eine Dynamik, die
innerhalb der begrenzten Skala der Menschheit Veraenderungen erlaubte,
die schliesslich zur Herausbildung von Nationen und Nationalstaaten
fuehrten--Einheiten mit relativer Autarkie.  Innerhalb nationaler
Grenzen konnten Bevoelkerungswachstum, Ressourcen und
Handlungsoptionen in Balance gehalten werden.

Diese zweifellos vereinfachte Darstellung erlaubt uns, die
Entwicklung der Erziehung von ihren fruehen Formen--der direkten
Weitergabe von Erfahrungen zwischen einzelnen Personen und zwischen
den Generationen--zu den religioes begruendeten Erziehungsformen
nachzuzeichnen.  Unter dem Einfluss religioeser Praemissen ging die
Erziehung spaeter ueber die Vermittlung des unmittelbaren, eng an die
Lebenspraxis gebundenen Wissens hinaus und wurde, wenn auch nicht
ganz muehelos, institutionalisiert in Form von Schulen und
Universitaeten, in denen Wissen, Wissenschaft und Gelehrsamkeit
verbreitet wurden.  Auch das war ein langer, viele Stufen
durchlaufender Prozess, der schliesslich zu unserem heutigen
allgemeinen Bildungssystem fuehrte, in dem Kirche und Staat getrennt
sind.  Die freie Erziehung und alle damit verbundenen Werte bilden
heute die allgemeine Grundlage unseres Bildungssystems.

Wenn man jemandem einen Hammer gibt, sieht jedes Problem wie ein
Nagel aus.  Wenn man jemandem ein Alphabet gibt, wird jedes Problem
zu einem Problem von Schriftkultur, Bildung und Erziehung--dieser
Vergleich charakterisiert einigermassen den gegenwaertigen
Diskussionsstand in Sachen Erziehung und Ausbildung.  Daraus folgt
allerdings nicht, dass mit dem Aufkommen des World Wide Web Erziehung
und Ausbildung darauf reduziert sein sollten, die notwendigen
Lehrplaene online anzubieten und die Erziehungsbeduerfnisse an dem, was
im Netzwerk zufaellig zur Verfuegung steht, auszurichten.  In der
heutigen Zeit des Umbruchs ist das Ende von Schriftkultur und
schriftkultureller Bildung nicht einfach ein Symptom, sondern eine
notwendige, ueber OnlineBildungsangebote hinausgehende Entwicklung.
Dies koennte nach einer voreiligen Kritik an der digitalen
Wissensverbreitung aussehen.  Wir wollen daher unsere Schlussfolgerung
etwas ausfuehrlicher rechtfertigen.


Das Hoechste und das Beste

Aus den neuen Formen unserer Selbstkonstituierung in einer Welt, die
durch Effizienz, hohe Bedarfsbefriedigung und eine unersaettliche
Faehigkeit, das Neue durch immer Neueres zu ersetzen, gekennzeichnet
ist, stellt sich auch das Problem von Erziehung und Ausbildung in
einer Weise neu, fuer die Schriftkultur und schriftkulturelle Bildung
nicht mehr hinreichend sind.  Seit etwa 30 Jahren schickt unser
Erziehungssystem die nachrueckenden Generationen in eine Zukunft, die
nur noch wenig mit den Inhalten, Strukturen und Denkweisen zu tun hat,
die diese Erziehung vermittelt.  Unter dem grossen Druck der sozialen,
politischen, oekonomischen und moralischen Erwartungen hat unser
Bildungssystem als Institution seine Glaubwuerdigkeit verloren, sofern
es sich in seinen Strukturen nicht analog zum Umbruch in unseren
Lebensumstaenden veraendert.  Die Inhalte und Denkweisen, die heute in
den Schulen, Laboratorien, Handbuechern und Erziehungsmethoden, nicht
zu reden vom lebendigen Inventar wie Lehrer und Ausbilder, vermittelt
werden, sind--wenn ueberhaupt--nur noch marginal auf den Umbruch von
einer einzigen beherrschenden Schriftkultur auf zahlreiche
Alphabetismen eingerichtet.  Zum gegenwaertigen Ausbildungsstand
junger Menschen hat IBM unverhohlen festgestellt: "Seit 1900 hat sich
fast jede Institution auf die jeweiligen Veraenderungen einstellen
koennen, mit einer Ausnahme: das Bildungssystem."

Gerade in letzter Zeit ist viel in die Ausbildung junger Menschen
investiert worden, aber an der Auffassung von Bildung und an der
Auffassungsfaehigkeit der Ausgebildeten hat sich wenig geaendert.  Wenn
heute an einem Gymnasium oder an einer Universitaet ein neues Labor
eingerichtet wird, ist es in dem Augenblick, in dem das letzte
Ausruestungsteil bestellt wurde, bereits veraltet.  Die Ausbildung
selbst unserer besten Lehrer hat sich inhaltlich bereits in dem
Augenblick eruebrigt, in dem die ersten Schueler in die Berufswelt
eintreten.  Je mehr sich unsere Schulen und Universitaeten bemuehen,
mit dem Umbruch Schritt zu halten, desto offensichtlicher wird es,
dass sie eine falsche Richtung einschlagen oder dass etwas im Kern
unseres Bildungssystems dieses Ziel unerreichbar macht.  Oft trifft
beides zu.  Manche schieben dieses Versagen auf die ueberladene
Buerokratie des Bildungssystems.  Daran ist sicher einiges wahr.
Andere fuehren das Versagen des Systems auf einen Mangel an guten
Lern- und Lehrmethoden zurueck.  Auch falsche Auffassungen von den
Aufgaben der Erziehung oder falsche Prioritaeten werden als Grund
genannt.  Gerade letztere haben zu immensen Fehlinvestitionen im
Bildungssektor gefuehrt.

Andere, nicht-schulische Gruende sind fuer die mangelnde
Leistungsfaehigkeit des Bildungssystems angefuehrt worden--falsch
verstandene Liberalitaet und Demokratie, Traditionsverlust, der
Zusammenbruch der Familie als Lebensund Erziehungsform, eine
ausschliesslich auf Tests abgerichtete Unterrichtsform.  Es gibt so
viele Erklaerungen wie es Kritiker unseres Bildungssystems gibt.
Manche dieser Erklaerungen greifen weit zurueck in die Zeit, in der die
Schrift entwickelt wurde: Erziehung beeintraechtigt Originalitaet,
daempft Spontaneitaet und zerstoert Kreativitaet.  Oder aber: Erziehung
leugnet in der sensibelsten Phase der individuellen Entwicklung, wenn
der Geist junger Menschen offen ist fuer alle nur denkbaren Eindruecke,
die Natuerlichkeit.

Wieder andere Argumente richten sich auf die gegenwaertige Situation:
Wenn die richtigen Texte gewaehlt (was immer hier richtig heisst) und
die besten Methoden angewandt wuerden, waere die Ausbildung fuer junge
Menschen interessanter und sie koennte es mit der Konkurrenz der
Unterhaltungsangebote aufnehmen.  Andere befuerworten einen leicht
verdaulichen Zugang zu Texten, die moeglicherweise als Comicstrips
oder als Internetbotschaften aus maximal sieben Saetzen mit maximal
sieben Woertern bestehen sollten.  Alle diese Erklaerungen gehen davon
aus, dass die Schriftkultur und schriftkulturelle Bildung ihre
Gueltigkeit bewahrt haben.  Sie alle entwerfen Strategien--einige
hilflos, einige verstiegen--, die die Funktion der schriftkulturellen
Bildung aufrecht erhalten sollen.  Ob sich die Bedingungen, die die
Schriftkultur entstehen liessen, so weit geaendert haben, dass nunmehr
eine voellig neue Lebenssituation auch neue Unterrichtsstrukturen
erfordern koennte, scheint niemanden zu interessieren.  Noch immer
scheint Matthew Arnolds traditionslastiges Selbstverstaendnis zu
gelten: "Bemuehe dich um das Hoechste und Beste, das unser Wissen
hervorgebracht hat."

In einer Welt, in der sich das Beste nur noch auf Waren, nicht auf
dynamisches Wissen bezieht, hat diese Position an UEberzeugungskraft
verloren.


Das Ideal und das Leben

Schulen aller Bildungsarten vermitteln ihren Schuelern eine
traditionelle Erziehung und bekennen sich zur soliden
Ausbildungstradition vergangener Zeiten.  Trotz allem behaupten die
Schulen unter dem Druck des Berufsmarktes, dass sie ihre Schueler auf
die neuen pragmatischen Lebensumstaende angemessen vorbereiten.
Einige Schulen bieten auch berufsbezogene Faecher an oder beziehen
berufsrelevante Ausbildungskomponenten in die traditionelle
Ausbildung ein.  EDV-Kurse gehoeren dazu.  Aber ein im Jahr 1996 in
den Vereinigten Staaten durchgefuehrter Test mit 500 Schulabsolventen
hat ergeben, dass nur 7% aller Testpersonen 15 von 20 Fragen richtig
beantworten konnten.  Fuenf Fragen bezogen sich auf Mathematik, der
Rest auf Geschichte und Literatur--allesamt also auf traditionellen
Bildungsstoff.

Diese und andere Ergebnisse lassen Bildungsexperten von einem
allgemein sinkenden Bildungsniveau sprechen, und die Experten klagen
darueber, dass das Bildungssystem nicht mehr den demokratischen Buerger
hervorbringe.  Derartige Analysen und Klagen nehmen ganz
offensichtlich keine Kenntnis davon, was sich in der Realitaet
abspielt.  Denn sie beziehen sich auf die USA, doch nachweislich das
reichste und vermutlich dynamischste Land der Welt, mit der
geringsten Arbeitslosenquote und der hoechsten Quote an
Unternehmensneugruendungen--wenn also die Bildung dennoch angeblich
versagt, so muss etwas anderes, Positives, an ihre Stelle getreten
sein.

Solange die Konzepte von Bildung und Ausbildung nicht neu gedacht
werden, koennen sie mit der Wirklichkeit nicht mehr Schritt halten.
Unter den gegenwaertig gefundenen Kompromissen wird unser
Bildungssystem weiter vor sich hin wursteln und die Klientel beider
Lager veraergern: diejenigen, die noch immer auf eine Bildung im
Rahmen des schriftkulturellen Modells fixiert sind, und diejenigen,
die Strukturveraenderungen fuer dringend geboten halten.

Vermutlich laesst sich der Universalitaetsanspruch des traditionellen
Bildungsmodells, der sich in den demokratischen Prinzipien von
Freiheit und Chancengleichheit widerspiegelt, in seiner
urspruenglichen Form nicht laenger aufrechterhalten.  Vielmehr sollte
sich das Bildungssystem gegenueber den Unterschieden zwischen den
Menschen, ihrem unterschiedlichen persoenlichen, sozialen und
kulturellen Hintergrund, ihrer Ethnizitaet und ihren individuellen
Faehigkeiten flexibler zeigen.  Statt zu standardisieren, sollte das
Bildungssystem die Unterschiede foerdern, um den Nutzen aus diesen
Unterschieden ziehen zu koennen.  Statt einen gleichen und allgemeinen
Zugang zur Mittelmaessigkeit zu garantieren, sollte das Bildungssystem,
unterschiedliche, sich ergaenzende Zugaenge zur Exzellenz bereitstellen.
Heute erweisen sich manche Menschen als unerziehbar.  Aber
vielleicht weisen sie nur Merkmale auf, die man nicht auf den in der
Schriftkultur verankerten gemeinsamen Bildungsnenner reduzieren kann.
Vielleicht koennten alternative Bildungswege ihre Faehigkeiten besser
erkennen und optimaler foerdern; vielleicht werden sich diese
Faehigkeiten in der Lebenspraxis als relevant und nuetzlich erweisen,
so unterschiedlich sie auch ausfallen moegen.

Eine Quotengleichheit in bezug auf Minoritaeten jeglicher Art geht
ebenfalls von einem falschen Demokratieverstaendnis im Bildungssystem
aus.  Denn oft genug werden diejenigen, die ermutigt und gefoerdert
werden sollen, damit ihrer speziellen Faehigkeiten und Chancen beraubt.
Das Prinzip der Quotengleichheit geht von der falschen Vorstellung
aus, dass der Einheitsbrei des perfekt funktionierenden Schmelztiegels
der Gesellschaft nuetzlicher sei als die Anerkennung und Foerderung von
Unterschieden.  Ob man damit eine gleichfoermige Mittelmaessigkeit oder
arbeitsteilige Exzellenz hervorbringt, scheint niemanden zu
interessieren.  Angemessener und realitaetsnaeher waere ein anderes
Verstaendnis von Chancengleichheit: wenn die Unterschiede anerkannt
und bewahrt und die daraus erwachsenden spezifischen Faehigkeit zur
vollen Entfaltung gebracht wuerden.

Das Bildungsprinzip der Schriftkultur bringt ein bestimmtes
Verstaendnis von Konformitaet und Standardisierung mit sich, das der
Lebenspraxis entspricht, die eine standardisierte Bildung notwendig
gemacht hatte.  Fuer die heute zur Verfuegung stehenden alternativen
Ausdrucks- und Kommunikationsmittel hat das derzeitige Bildungssystem
offenbar keinen Platz.  Aber gerade sie wuerden die Auswahlmoeglichkeit
aus einer erweiterten Skala von Optionen erheblich erleichtern; denn
gerade sie ermoeglichen die geforderte hoehere Effizienz.  Wir muessen
die Bildungswege auf die individuellen Beduerfnisse der einzelnen
Gruppen besser zuschneiden.  Dies kann aber nur geschehen, wenn wir
dem unverbruechlichen Recht auf Ausbildung und Arbeit zum Zwecke der
Persoenlichkeitsentfaltung die gleiche Bedeutung wie dem Recht auf
Freiheit und Gleichheit einraeumen.

Die hier skizzierte globale Dimension der Lebenspraxis ist nicht ein
von einem waghalsigen Unternehmer erfundenes Szenario.  Sie spiegelt
vielmehr eine Skala wider, innerhalb derer das Bevoelkerungswachstum,
die Ressourcenverteilung und die zu neuen Effizienzebenen fuehrenden
Handlungsoptionen einen kritischen Zustand erreicht haben.  Viele
Menschen auf dieser Welt erhalten niemals eine Chance auf Bildung und
Ausbildung; viele Menschen sind staendig durch Hungersnoete und
Epidemien bedroht und muessen ein menschenunwuerdiges Leben fuehren.
Diese Tatsachen stehen allerdings nicht im Widerspruch zu der
beschriebenen Dynamik, die die Alternativen zur Schriftkultur und
Bildung hervorgebracht hat.  Wir muessen daher die Art des vom
Bildungssystem vermittelten Wissens und seine Auswirkungen auf die
Ausgebildeten hinterfragen.


Relevanz

Schulen und Universitaeten werden heute haeufig dafuer kritisiert, dass
sie ihren Schuelern und Studenten nicht mehr genuegend relevantes
Wissen vermitteln.  Was aber heisst Relevanz in unserem Zusammenhang?
Viele Wissenschaftler meinen, dass die auf unsere kulturelle Tradition
bezogenen Fakten und Zusammenhaenge relevant seien, wie etwa
diejenigen, die im oben erwaehnten Test abgefragt wurden.  Relevant
sind aber auch die Faehigkeit zum logischen Denken, ausreichende
naturwissenschaftliche Kenntnisse, um den Reichtum der modernen
Technologien zu verstehen, Fremdsprachen und andere Inhalte, die die
Schueler und Studenten auf die praktische Lebenswelt vorbereiten.

Kritiker der traditionellen Lehrplaene stellen die Relevanz einer
Tradition in Frage, die eher exklusiv als umfassend und integrativ zu
sein scheint.  Sie wuerden sich mehr Multikulturalitaet und
Traditionskritik und weniger Konkurrenzdruck wuenschen.  Doch obwohl
solche Empfehlungen den neuen Kontext unseres gesellschaftlichen
Lebens und unserer Lebenspraxis beruecksichtigen, stellen sie ihn doch
nicht in den weiteren Zusammenhang der veraenderten allgemeinen
Strukturen und lassen so die Relevanzkriterien vermissen, die
ausserhalb ihres eigenen Kompetenzbereichs liegen.

Die Frage nach der Relevanz lenkt unseren Blick auf die Vergangenheit
und bestimmt zugleich unser auf die Zukunft gerichtetes Handeln.  Dass
die schriftkulturelle Bildung und Erziehung in den Anfaengen der
Schriftkultur xenophobisch oder rassistisch und vor allem politisch
war, braucht nicht sonderlich betont zu werden.  Wer nicht zur Polis
gehoerte und eine andere Sprache sprach, wurde aus politischen Gruenden
einer Ausbildung unterzogen: Er sollte sich, auf welcher Stufe auch
immer, so schnell wie moeglich als ein nuetzliches Mitglied der
Lebensgemeinschaft erweisen koennen.  Zwar aenderten sich die
Bedingungen fuer Erziehung und Bildung im Verlaufe der Zeit nachhaltig,
aber deren politische Dimension blieb erhalten.  Deshalb kann es nur
hilfreich sein, mit gewissen schriftkulturellen Haltungen aufzuraeumen,
die nationale, ethnische, rassistische oder aehnliche Elemente
aufweisen.  Denn es ist voellig irrelevant, ob Pythagoras Grieche und
wie originell seine Geometrie war.  Auch ist es irrelevant, ob diese
oder jene Person aus diesem oder jenem Teil der Welt den Ruhm fuer ein
literarisches Meisterwerk, ein Kunstwerk oder fuer einen religioesen
oder philosophischen Gedanken verdient.  Was allein zaehlt, ist die
Frage, inwiefern solche Leistungen fuer die Menschheit und fuer ihre
immer komplexere Lebenspraxis relevant wurden.  Auch leiten wir
unsere Werturteile nicht aus dem sportentliehenen Modell ab, also aus
der Frage nach dem Besten, dem Schnellsten, dem Meisten; vielmehr
orientieren wir sie daran, wie ein jeder von uns seine Identitaet in
noch nie dagewesenen Arbeits- und Freizeitbedingungen und den daraus
hervorgehenden Empfindungen konstituiert.  Die Frage nach der
Relevanz ist also eindeutig zukunftsgerichtet und bringt im uebrigen
die Erkenntnis, dass die Erfahrungen aus der Vergangenheit fuer unseren
neuen Lebenszusammenhang immer weniger wichtig werden.

Was also sollte unterrichtet werden?  Sprachen?  Mathematik?  Chemie?
Philosophie?  Wir koennen nicht zu allem einfach nur "ja" sagen, ohne
die Frage nach den angemessenen Unterrichtsstoffen in den Rahmen
unserer Lebenspraxis zu stellen.  Das heisst aber vor allem, dass wir
Erziehung und Bildung nicht wie bisher mit einer religioesen oder
dogmatischen Aura versehen duerfen: Die Dozenten kennen die ewigen
Wahrheiten; die Studenten folgen den Vorlesungen und empfangen das
Sakrament.

Alle schulischen Grundfaecher haben sich im Laufe der Zeit veraendert,
und die Geschwindigkeit, in der sich heute die Veraenderungen
vollziehen, nimmt zu.  Das gegenwaertige Verstaendnis von Sprache,
Mathematik, Chemie und Philosophie muss nicht unbedingt auf dem
Prinzip des fortschreitenden Kenntniserwerbs gruenden.
Naturwissenschaft hat z. B. nicht direkt etwas mit Akkumulation zu
tun.  Das Gleiche gilt fuer das Erlernen von Sprachen, trotz aller
anderweitigen ersten Eindruecke.  Das mechanische Einpauken von Regeln,
die als invariabel gelten, ist weniger wichtig als eine Kenntnis von
Verfahren, mit denen wir uns das fuer unsere dynamische Existenz
relevante Wissen zugaenglich machen koennen.  Es ist geradezu unmoeglich,
all das zu behalten, was die Schulausbildung--egal wie gut oder
schlecht sie ist--unseren Schuelern eintrichtert.  Viel wichtiger waere
es zu wissen, wie und wo wir das, was wir fuer eine bestimmte Aufgabe
benoetigen, finden und verwenden koennen.

Ist es wichtig, dass wir Square Dance, Heavy-Metal-Musik, Bridge oder
chinesische Kochkunst unterrichten?  Dieses und vieles mehr steht
heute in den Lehrplaenen vieler Schulen und Universitaeten.  Die Frage,
wie relevant solche Unterrichtsinhalte fuer Lehrplan und
Studienordnung sind, muss sich nach denselben pragmatischen Kriterien
richten, von denen unser Leben und unser Lebensunterhalt abhaengen.
Die Relativierung von Schriftkultur und Bildung in unserer
veraenderten Lebenspraxis hat durchaus schon zu neuen Lehrinhalten
gefuehrt.  Sie allein koennen allerdings keine Ausbildung ersetzen, die
die Denkund Empfindungsfaehigkeiten in einem durch erhoehte Komplexitaet
und Dynamik gekennzeichneten Lebensraum foerdern.

Die heutige Erziehung muss sich an der Dynamik der
Persoenlichkeitsentfaltung orientieren, die fuer die Lebenspraxis
unseres neuen Zeitalters charakteristisch ist.  Das heisst keinesfalls,
dass Erziehung durch ziel- und planlose Fernsehprogramme oder endlose
Reisen im Internet ersetzt werden kann.  Wir muessen allerdings
begreifen, dass wir nicht ohne weiteres Schriftkultur, Bildung und
Effizienz gleichzeitig haben koennen, denn sie sind in mancherlei
Hinsicht unvereinbar.  Ein solches Unterfangen wuerde vermutlich nur
zu groesserer Verwirrung fuehren.  Und schliesslich muessen wir erkennen,
dass Bildung im sekundaeren und tertiaeren Bildungsbereich nicht
unbedingt erforderlich ist fuer diejenigen, die einfach nur eine
Berufsausbildung benoetigen.

Wir haben bereits zeigen koennen, wie die zunehmenden
Vermittlungsprozesse auf dem neuen Markt sich auf die Effizienzebenen
ausgewirkt und zahlreiche neue Sprachen fuer den Zuschnitt, die
Beschreibung, Koordinierung und Synchronisierung der menschlichen
Arbeit hervorgebracht haben.  Fuer viele Arbeitsformen, von den
Kuensten bis zu den Naturwissenschaften, benoetigen wir
Programmiervorgaenge, die nicht nach falsch oder richtig fragen,
sondern nach optimaler Einrichtung und stetiger Weiterentwicklung.
Fuer die Erfordernisse unserer neuen Lebensskala--fuer Globalitaet,
Arbeitsteilung und Ressourcenverteilung, fuer die zahlreichen neuen
Elemente im Bereich der Wirtschaft, der Technik, der Kommunikation,
des Marketing und des Managements--brauchen wir neue, spezifische
Ausbildungsprogramme.  Die Schriftkultur kann dies nicht leisten.

Erziehung beginnt mit der Erfahrung dessen, was nicht gegenwaertig und
nicht unmittelbar ist.  Sie beinhaltet Erfahrungen, die sich aus
Vergleichen, aus Nachahmung von Handlungen und bei der Herausbildung
von individuellen Mustern bezueglich der biologischen Merkmale des
Menschen ergeben.  Erst spaeter kommen Sprache und die Verwendung von
sprachlichen Konventionen und Metaphern hinzu, von denen einige Teil
der Schriftsprache, andere Teil anderer Sprachen sind.  Mit der
evolutionsgeschichtlichen Entstehung der Familie beginnen die
Erziehung und eine neue Phase der Arbeitsteilung.  Die sehr enge
Skala eines nomadischen Stammeslebens kannte dabei andere
Erziehungsformen als die erweiterte Skala, innerhalb derer zunaechst
Formen der Notation und schliesslich hochentwickelte Schriftsprachen,
bzw. die technische Sprache des Zeichnens entstanden.  Der
Allgemeinheitsgrad der Schriftsprache und die daraus resultierende
Schriftlichkeit als Grundlage jeglicher Erfahrungsvermittlung brachte
wiederum andere Erziehungsformen mit sich.  Wir sehen also, dass die
sich veraendernden Formen von Erziehung und Bildung aus den
Veraenderungen der menschlichen Evolution ergeben und dass somit
weitere Veraenderungen in der Natur dieser Entwicklung liegen.  Das
veranlasst uns, die gegenwaertigen Erziehungs- und Ausbildungsformen zu
ueberdenken und sie mit Blick auf den erweiterten Rahmen der
menschlichen Taetigkeiten zu verbessern, statt sie zur Wahrung einer
historisch gewordenen Kulturphase auf ihre jetzige Form ein fuer
allemal festzulegen.

Wir mussten erst lernen, das zu sein, was wir heute sind.  Wir sind es
geworden durch das, was wir in Bezug auf unser individuelles und
gesellschaftliches Daseins tun.  Sprechen, schreiben und lesen heisst,
das zu verstehen, was wir sprechen, schreiben und lesen.  Die
einfache mechanische Reproduktion von Woertern oder Lautmustern koennte
genauso gut von entsprechend programmierten Maschinen vorgenommen
werden.  Aber sprechen, schreiben und lesen lernen heisst, sich des
durch Sprechen, Schreiben und Lesen hervorgerufenen pragmatischen
Kontextes der zwischenmenschlichen Beziehungen bewusst zu werden, und
die fuer diese Vorgaenge notwendigen Fertigkeiten zu erwerben.  Dieses
Bewusstsein schliesst allerdings das Bewusstsein von der Moeglichkeit
einer Kontextveraenderung mit ein.

Erziehung und Ausbildung bedeuten, andere und sich in einen Prozess
einzubinden, der darauf ausgerichtet ist, dasjenige Wissen zu
erwerben und zu vermitteln, das fuer die weitere Vermehrung des
Wissens notwendig ist.  Daher koennen die Erziehungsinhalte nicht
Wissen im allgemeinen sein, denn Schulen und Universitaeten koennen die
Vielfalt der menschlichen Erfahrungen nicht nachvollziehen.  Die
post-industrielle, auf einer digitalen Struktur basierende Erfahrung
ist so heterogen, dass die Vielfalt dessen, was die heutige
Lebenspraxis erforderlich macht, nicht unter vereinheitlichende
Ausbildungsgaenge subsumiert werden kann.  Wichtiger als allgemein
zugaengliche und allen verfuegbare Informationen ist daher die Kenntnis
davon, wie und wo ich finde, was ich brauche.  Wissen zu besitzen
wird in diesem Zusammenhang zweitrangig; entscheidend ist der Zugang
zum Wissen und ein gutes Verstaendnis der auf die neuen
Erkenntisformen konzentrierten veraenderten Lebenspraxis.  Der Umgang
mit der Informationsfuelle und die Faehigkeit, diese den Technologien
der Informationsverarbeitung zuzufuehren, muss Teil unserer
Ausbildungsprogramme werden.  Die Studenten muessen verstehen und
erklaeren lernen, wie sich die heutigen Erkenntnisformen und
Erkenntnisinhalte, also das Rohmaterial der digitalen Maschine, aus
unseren Erfahrungen ableiten.

Zwischen den von uns entworfenen Wegen, auf denen wir unser
biologisches Sein in das Sein der uns beheimatenden Welt projizieren,
und dem Ergebnis unserer Bemuehungen besteht eine Einheit.  Diese
kennzeichnet unseren geistigen und emotionalen Zustand und bestimmt
unser Denken und Fuehlen.  An einem bestimmten Punkt der menschlichen
Entwicklung, nachdem die Trennung von koerperlicher und geistiger
Arbeit vollzogen war, wurde das Denken von seiner unmittelbaren
Zweckgerichtetheit befreit.  Die einmal erreichte Abstraktion des
Denkens entsprach der Faehigkeit, in seinen Prozess eingebunden zu sein,
sich seiner bewusst zu sein und ihn zu beurteilen.  Das ist die Ebene
der Theorie.  Die gegenwaertig zu verzeichnende Dynamik wirkt sich auf
den Status der Theorie aus, darauf, wie wir sie bilden, und darauf,
wie wir sie vermitteln.  Zumindest mit Blick auf ihre Vermittlung,
wohl aber auch mit Blick auf ihre Formulierung, muessen wir uns im
gegebenen Zusammenhang kurz mit der Entwicklung der Universitaeten
beschaeftigen.


Tempel des Wissens

Nachdem einmal in der Schriftkultur ein allgemeines Instrument der
Kommunikation und Koordination etabliert war, wurden Ausbildung und
Erziehung zur Institution, zur Maschine der Schriftkultur.  Dies
vollzog sich parallel zur Versachlichung vieler anderer Formen
menschlicher Praxis: Religion, Rechtsprechung, Militaer.  Die
Universitaeten der westlichen Welt verkoerperten das elitaere Ideal der
Schriftkultur auf jede nur denkbare Weise: Exklusivitaet, Philosophie
der Paedagogik, Architektur, allgemeine Ziele, Curriculum, Lehrkoerper,
Studentenschaft, Beziehung zur OEffentlichkeit, religioeser Status.
Diese Universitaeten kuemmerten sich nicht um die Handwerkskuenste,
kannten und anerkannten keinen Lehrlingsstatus.  Anders als die
Schulen konnten die Universitaeten ihren Einfluss weit ueber ihre
Grenzen hinaus geltend machen, eine fuehrende Rolle im geistigen Leben
der Bevoelkerung spielen und dabei eine Aura der Exklusivitaet aufbauen.
Das lag nicht nur am religioesen Fundament, auf dem die
Universitaeten ruhten.  Die Universitaeten besassen die wichtigen
geistigen Dokumente ueber die Theorien der Natur- und
Geisteswissenschaften und die dazu gehoerigen Ausbildungsprogramme.
Diese Quellen unterstrichen die Rolle einer allgemeinen Bildung
(nicht nur als Spiegelung des katholischen Anspruchs der Kirche),
deren grundlegende Komponente einen Tempel des Wissens erstellte, von
dem aus die Theorien ueber die westliche Welt verbreitet wurden.  In
ihrer Anlage und in den durch sie verkoerperten Werten fungierte die
Universitaet als ein Modell fuer die Gesellschaft und als wichtiger
Garant der gesellschaftlichen Dynamik.  Tradition, Sprachen (die den
direkten Zugang zur Welt der klassischen Philosophie und Literatur
eroeffneten) und die Kuenste wurden als Einheit aufgefasst.  Die Technik
und alle praktischen Anwendungsformen des Wissens hatten in ihr
keinen Platz.

Im Gegensatz zu heute waren jene Universitaeten ihrer Zeit so weit
voraus, dass sie fast schon wieder den Kontakt mit der Wirklichkeit
verloren hatten.  Ihre Welt war eine Welt fortschrittlicher Gedanken,
idealisierter sozialer und moralischer Werte und neuer
wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnisse, die in metaphysischer Abstraktion
zelebriert wurden.  In unserem Zusammenhang interessiert die
dynamische Entwicklung der universitaeren Ausbildung bis etwa zur
Jahrhundertwende und die daran geknuepfte Frage, inwieweit diese den
heutigen Ausbildungszielen genuegt oder sie verfehlt.  Als die ersten
Universitaeten gegruendet wurden, war der Zugang zu ihnen begrenzt.
Daher ist ein Vergleich zwischen damals und heute eigentlich
irrelevant.  Er koennte indes erklaeren, warum heute noch immer die
grosse Zahl der Studierenden, die vor hundert oder auch nur vor
fuenfzig Jahren niemals ein Studium haette aufnehmen koennen, nicht
uneingeschraenkt willkommen ist.  Die Universitaet vermittelt eben
nicht nur Werte, sondern auch Vorurteile.

Die Bedeutung des historischen Hintergrunds tritt zutage, wenn wir
uns die formative Macht der Sprache, ihre Leistung fuer die
Aufbewahrung von Ideen und Idealen, die auf Dauer angelegt sind, und
ihre Funktion fuer die Verbreitung dieser Doktrin von Bestand und
Autoritaet vergegenwaertigen.  Die Religion durchdrang die Natur- und
Geisteswissenschaften und machte sich nachdruecklich geltend, wenn es
darum ging, den Erfindungen und Theorien Bedeutung zuzuweisen.  Die
in diesen Universitaeten vermittelte Bildung sollte fuer ewig gelten
und orientierte sich an einem Modell, das den Menschen als Zentrum
der Welt und als Hoehepunkt der goettlichen Schoepfung ansah.  Das ganze
Programm der Universitaet war auf Kontinuitaet angelegt und auf das
Fundament der Schriftkultur gestellt.  Als Organisationsform
beguenstigte sie Integration anstelle von Differenzierung.  Sie war
eine Gegenkraft, ein kritisches Instrument und ein Rahmen fuer
geistige Taetigkeit.  "Wissen ist Macht": Dieses heute oft mit der
politischen Linken assoziierte Motto hat seinen Ursprung in der
Universitaet des Mittelalters und in konservativen Machtbeziehungen,
fuer die Schriftkultur und schriftkulturelle Bildung die grundlegenden
Strukturen boten.

Man kann ohne weiteres sagen, dass die Universitaet des Mittelalters
die Verdinglichung der Sprache verkoerperte, die Verdinglichung des
griechischen logos und der roemischen ratio.  Alle vorausgegangenen
Bemuehungen, die Vergangenheit zu versachlichen, wurden in den
Forschungs- und Lehrprogrammen der Universitaet zusammengefasst und als
Modell fuer die Zukunft entworfen.  Alternative Denk- und
Kommunikationsformen blieben ausgeschlossen oder wurden den Formen
der Sprache angepasst bzw. ausnahmslos der herrschenden Rationalitaet
unterworfen.  Auf diesen Voraussetzungen entwickelte sich die
Universitaet als eine Institution, die den methodischen Zweifel uebte.
Sie wurde zur intellektuellen Maschine, die immer neue Erklaerungen
vom Universum als Ganzes und seiner Teile versuchte.

Die Umstaende, die zu einer Trennung zwischen allgemeinen geistigen
und erzieherischen Aufgaben fuehrte, sind auf verschiedene,
miteinander verknuepfte Faktoren zurueckzufuehren.  Einer dieser
Faktoren ist zweifellos die Druckmaschine.  Ausschlaggebend aber
waren die praktischen Erwartungen.  Die Menschen mussten naemlich
erkennen, dass sie die von ihnen benoetigten Maschinen nicht mit Hilfe
ihrer Latein- oder Griechischkenntnisse oder den auswendig gelernten
Litaneien bauen konnten, sondern nur mit Mathematik und Mechanik.
Ein Teil dieses Wissens fand sich in den griechischen und
lateinischen Texten, die von muselmanischen und juedischen Gelehrten
nach dem Zusammenbruch des Roemischen Reiches aufbewahrt worden waren.
Auch musste man lernen, wie man seine praktischen Ziele formulieren
und wie man technische Plaene so vermitteln konnte, dass sie zum Bau
von Strassen, Bruecken, Gebaeuden und vielem mehr anleiteten.  Fuer die
Erkundung neuer Energiequellen reichte das aristotelische Weltbild
nicht aus.  Mehr physikalisches, chemisches, biologisches und
geologisches Wissen war erforderlich.  Der Zugang zu diesen Bereichen
fuehrte immer noch ueber Schrift und Schriftkultur, obwohl all diese
Bereiche im Ansatz bereits ihre eigene Sprache entwickelt hatten.
Maschinen wurden als Metaphern fuer den Menschen verstanden und gebaut.
Sie verkoerperten eine animistische Anschauung, obwohl sie
tatsaechlich die Beduerfnisse und Erwartungen erfuellten, die aus einer
Existenzskala jenseits animistischer Erfahrungen hervorgingen.

Die Erfahrung industrieller Arbeit, ihrerseits die Schule eines neuen
pragmatischen Erfahrungsrahmens, vermittelte ein Bewusstsein von
Kreativitaet, Produktivitaet und Vertrauen.  Arbeit und
gesellschaftliches Leben verloren an Homogenitaet.  Doch in dem Moment,
in dem der Anspruch der Schriftkultur, alles erklaeren zu koennen und
das einzige Medium fuer neue Theorien zu sein, seine Grenzen erreichte,
blieben auch die Universitaeten hinter der Entwicklung der
Lebenspraxis zurueck.  Der Unterschied zwischen der Physik Galileo
Galileis und der Newtonschen Physik ist kleiner als der Unterschied
zwischen diesen beiden und der Einsteinschen Relativitaetstheorie;
dieser wiederum ist geringer als das, was alle drei von der sich
seitdem entwickelten kosmischen Physik trennt.  Dieses neue
physikalische Denken erschliesst eine Skala und einen Bereich, der
ueber alles bisher Gekannte weit hinausgeht, und er beinhaltet vor
allem eine voellig neue Art der Problemformulierung.  Nicht zuletzt in
diesem Bereich zeigt sich, dass die Menschheit neue kognitive
Erklaerungsmodelle anwendet, denen die Wissensinstrumentarien der
Vergangenheit nicht mehr genuegen.  Ein Gleiches gilt uebrigens fuer die
neueren Theorien in Biologie, Chemie und zunehmend auch in Soziologie,
Wirtschaft und den Entscheidungswissenschaften.  Wir sehen daran,
ein wie wichtiges und umfassendes Kriterium dasjenige der Skala und
die darin erfasste Komplexitaet darstellt, ein Kriterium, das
letztendlich auch entsprechende Auswirkungen auf die Theorie und
Praxis von Ausbildung und Erziehung hat.


Kohaerenz und Verbindung

Erziehung und Ausbildung haben ihr Gebiet gut abgesteckt.  Einerseits
haben sie die Erwartungen derjenigen nicht erfuellt, die bei der Suche
nach einem Platz in der veraenderten Lebenspraxis Unterstuetzung
benoetigt haetten, andererseits hat sich ein neues Paradigma natur- und
geisteswissenschaftlicher Forschung durchgesetzt--das
rechnergestuetzte Arbeiten (computation).  Vor allem im Zusammenspiel
mit den experimentellen und theoretischen Naturwissenschaften hat die
rechnergestuetzte Arbeit Ebenen erreicht, auf denen sowohl die
Erwartungen nach geistiger Kohaerenz als auch nach einer Verknuepfung
mit Instanzen ausserhalb des unmittelbaren Forschungsgebiets
befriedigt werden konnten.  Rechnergestuetztes Arbeiten hat
mittlerweile auch die Bildungssysteme erfasst, ohne dass es allerdings
dessen grundlegende Strukturen ersetzt hat.  Dennoch haben die
Buerokratien, die nach den traditionellen Funktionsregeln organisiert
sind, das Ausmass der Veraenderung, welches ihre eigene
Existenzberechtigung in Frage stellt, noch nicht erkannt.

In einigen privaten Schulen und Universitaeten der USA sind zwar
mittlerweile selbst die Studentenwohnheime mit Computerterminals
ausgeruestet.  Dennoch ist fuer die Mehrzahl der Studierenden die
Arbeitszeit am Computer begrenzt und auf bestimmte Arbeitsbereiche,
hauptsaechlich Textverarbeitung, beschraenkt.  Viel zu viel
Bildungseinrichtungen setzen Computer lediglich fuer administrative
Arbeit wie Haushaltsfuehrung und Immatrikulation ein.  In den
europaeischen Laendern ist die Situation noch schlechter.  Und im
Vergleich zu den aermeren Laender dieser Welt kann man nur hoffen, dass
sich der Unterschied nicht noch vertiefen wird.  Wenn der Zugang zu
den Stromnetzen aehnlich geregelt waere, gaebe es einen Aufschrei.
Dabei sollten heutzutage EDVgestuetzte Verfahren genauso verbreitet
sein wie Elektrizitaet.

Wenn aber die Universitaeten keinen der heutigen Zeit angemessenen
Rahmen fuer Forschung und Lehre schaffen, versaeumen sie ihre ureigene
Aufgabe, neues und originelles Wissen zu gewinnen und zu vermitteln.
Sie koennen allenfalls die anderswo gewonnenen Ergebnisse aus zweiter
Hand praesentieren.  Damit kann man vielleicht ein gutes Verstaendnis
der Vergangenheit vermitteln, aber nur eine sehr fragwuerdige
Durchdringung von Problemen der Gegenwart und Zukunft.

Innerhalb einer Sprache zu leben bedeutet auch, die in dieser Sprache
verarbeiteten Erfahrungen zu verinnerlichen.  Die natuerliche Sprache
verkoerpert in sich eine bestimmte Erfahrung von Raum und Zeit;
Programmiersprachen indes verkoerpern bestimmte logische Strukturen
oder eine objektbezogene Funktionsweise der Welt.  Diese Erfahrungen
geben den Bezugsrahmen des Vorverstaendnisses von Welt ab.  Wir haben
gesehen, wie die verschiedenen Sprachstufen des Menschen das den
Entwicklungsstufen jeweils eigene Wissen und die entsprechenden
Erfahrungsstrukturen widerspiegelten.  Wir haben auch gesehen, wie
durch die Ausdifferenzierung von Sprache, Erfahrungen und
Lebenspraxis schliesslich auch Schriftsprache und Schriftkultur ihre
Rolle als optimales Medium fuer die Vermittlung und den allen
gemeinsamen Zugang zu diesen Erfahrungen der Lebenspraxis verloren,
ohne dabei alle ihre Funktionen aufgegeben zu haben.  Tatsache aber
ist, dass die Plaene fuer ein neues Gebaeude, fuer Bruecken, Maschinen und
viele andere Gegenstaende nicht mehr im schriftsprachlichen Diskurs
formuliert werden koennen, wie hochentwickelt dieser Diskurs und die
diesen Diskurs vermittelnden Bildungsinstanzen auch immer sein moegen.
Eine beschleunigte Dynamik und eine allgemein verbreitete Praxis der
Vermittlung, die nicht mehr auf der Schriftkultur basiert, sind in
unserem neuen Stadium jenseits der Schriftkultur zu einem wichtigen
Bestandteil unserer Lebenspraxis geworden und definieren die unserem
Leben zugrundeliegenden Strukturen neu.  Die Sprache behaelt darin
eine eingeschraenkte Funktion.  Sie ist ein Zeichensystem unter vielen
anderen Zeichensystemen, von denen einige sich besonders gut fuer
Rationalisierung und Automatisierung eignen, und sie wird nun
ihrerseits in Maschinen integriert, die fuer Zeichenverarbeitung
(insbesondere fuer Informationsverarbeitung) entwickelt wurden.
Dieser Entwicklungsprozess kann an einem einfachen Beispiel
verdeutlicht werden: Um die in den Homerischen Texten verarbeitete
Erfahrung in aller Tiefe und Subtilitaet verstehen zu koennen, benoetigt
man eine gruendliche Kenntnis des Altgriechischen.  Um die
juristischen Texte des Roemischen Reiches verstehen zu koennen, braucht
man Lateinkenntnisse und daneben noch einige andere Kenntnisse.  Um
aber Algebra verstehen zu koennen--das Wort kommt aus dem Arabischen
al-dschabr und heisst soviel wie "Vereinigen gleichartiger Glieder auf
beiden Seiten zu einem Glied"--braucht man nicht das Arabische zu
beherrschen.

Bildung und Schriftkultur spielen in unserer derzeitigen Erfahrung
der Selbstkonstituierung eine viel geringere Rolle als in der
Vergangenheit.  Dennoch zwingt die daraus hergeleitete Erziehung
nahezu allen Bereichen ihre Merkmale auf: Der Nachvollzug bereits
bekannten Wissens ist Voraussetzung fuer die Entdeckung des
Unbekannten.  Wenn wir uns indes genauer damit beschaeftigen wuerden,
wieviel und was genau wir von den zurueckliegenden Erfahrungen wissen
und verstehen muessen, um neue Formen der Lebenspraxis entwickeln zu
koennen, waeren wir ziemlich ueberrascht.  Die erste UEberraschung liegt
in der Erkenntnis, dass sich nachhaltige Veraenderungen vollziehen, und
zwar von Arbeits- und Denkformen, die auf fundamentale Weise an
vergangene Erfahrungen geknuepft sind, zu Bereichen der
Identitaetskonstituierung, die die Vergangenheit weder nachvollziehen
noch wiederholen.  Vielmehr leugnen solche neuen Erfahrungen die
Vergangenheit geradezu und machen sie relativ unbedeutend.  Wenn wir
uns von den Fesseln der Vergangenheit loesen, koennen wir erkennen, dass
das in Texten ausgedrueckte Wissen bisweilen unser Verstaendnis der
Gegenwart einschraenkt, weil es ein Vorverstaendnis von der Zukunft in
sich traegt, das neue, effektive Erfahrungen verhindert.  Die zweite
UEberraschung ergibt sich aus der Erkenntnis, dass andere nicht
schriftkulturelle Mittel die menschliche Selbstkonstituierung viel
besser foerdern und dass diese neuen Mittel eine andere Grundstruktur
aufweisen.

"Ob wir es wollen oder nicht, die Naturwissenschaften stellen
vermutlich die groesste intellektuelle Leistung des Menschen dar, und
jede Form von Erziehung, die diese Tatsache ausser acht laesst, verfehlt
in eben diesem Masse ihre Aufgaben."  Diese Auffassung Searles teilen
viele.  Nicht deutlich genug wird in diesem Zitat allerdings, dass
sich die Naturwissenschaften eigentlich erst entwickeln konnten,
nachdem sie ihre der Sprache und Schriftkultur untergeordnete Rolle
ueberwunden hatten.  Die Mathematisierung von Naturwissenschaft und
Technik, die Konzentration auf computation, die Notwendigkeit, sich
auch den Design-Aspekten der menschlichen Taetigkeit zu widmen (etwa
innerhalb von Soziologie, Jura, Medizin usw.) gehoeren allesamt
alternativen Erklaerungsformen an, die ein schriftkulturelles Denken
immer weniger leistungsfaehig erscheinen lassen.  Sie eroeffnen damit
neue Horizonte fuer die Forschung in Astronomie, Genetik und
Anthropologie.  Neben die kognitiven Faehigkeiten, die der neue
pragmatische Zusammenhang erfordert, treten metakognitive Faehigkeiten:
Dazu gehoert vor allem die Faehigkeit, sein eigenes Wissen und seine
eigene Lernfaehigkeit in einer Welt der Veraenderung, der Vielfalt, der
Arbeitsteilung, der vermittelten Arbeit, der weltweiten Verknuepfung
und der Heterogenitaet bestaendig zu ueberpruefen.

Wir wissen heute noch nicht genau, wie wir den Ausbildungsbedarf
formulieren und quantifizieren, welche Mittel und Kriterien fuer die
Leistungsmessung wir heranziehen sollen.  Wenn wir lediglich einen
Respekt vor der Tradition, gute Manieren und eine allgemeine
Urteilsfaehigkeit anstreben, dann beschraenken wir uns auf das
Persoenlichkeitsideal der Vergangenheit.  Halten wir uns nur einmal
die enormen Kosten vor Augen.  In den Vereinigten Staaten werden von
Eltern, Schuelern, aus privaten und oeffentlichen Mitteln jaehrlich ueber
370 Milliarden Dollar fuer das Bildungswesen aufgebracht.  Dahinter
verbergen sich neben den allgemeinen Kosten unzaehlige spezielle
Ausbildungs- und Stipendienprogramme.  Aber wenn wir uns klarmachen,
dass eine Gruppe von 25 Schuelern bzw.  Studenten mit bis zu 250000
Dollar finanziert wird, dann geht in der Gleichung zwischen
Finanzierungsaufwand und Ausbildungsergebnis irgend etwas nicht auf,
dann ist das Ergebnis dieser Investitionen niederschmetternd.  Allein
die Tatsache, dass bis zu einer Million Schueler und Studierender
jaehrlich Schule oder Studium abbrechen--die Zahl steigt und ist in
vielen anderen westlichen Laendern aehnlich hoch--und dass komplementaere
Massnahmen zur Eingliederung dieser jungen Menschen in den
Arbeitsmarkt weitere Finanzaufwendungen erfordern wuerden, macht
deutlich, dass mit unserem Bildungssystem nicht alles in Ordnung sein
kann.  In anderen Laendern sind die pro Kopf entstehenden
Ausbildungskosten und die Detailprobleme anders, aber die allgemeinen
Fragen und Unsicherheiten sind die gleichen.  In vielen Laendern
(Frankreich, Deutschland, Italien, einige Laender in Osteuropa) dauert
die Schulzeit laenger als das, was man in den USA fuer normal halten
wuerde.  In Deutschland will die Diskussion ueber die Dauer der
Schulzeit nicht enden.  Reichen zwoelf oder dreizehn Schuljahre?  Wie
lange darf ein Student an einer deutschen Universitaet eingeschrieben
sein?  Und mit der Vereinigung Deutschlands stellten sich neue
Probleme: eine ausreichende Zahl ausreichend qualifizierter Lehrer,
angemessene Ausstattung, Finanzierung der Schulen in den neuen
Bundeslaendern.  In Japan dauert die Schulzeit zwar nur zwoelf Jahre,
beinhaltet aber insgesamt mehr Schultage (230 Schultage jaehrlich im
Vergleich zu 212 in Deutschland und 180 in den USA).  In Frankreich
ist sogar das Vorschulstadium staatlich reguliert, hier liegt die
Gesamtschulzeit bei 15 Jahren.  Dennoch beherrschen 40% aller
franzoesischen Schueler am Ende der Schulzeit ihre Sprache nicht
fehlerfrei.  Als Richelieu vor ungefaehr 360 Jahren die Academie
Francaise als Hueter der Sprache gruendete, konnte er nicht ahnen, dass
die Sprache ihre Bedeutung fuer das Leben und die Arbeit der Menschen
verlieren wuerde und dass trotz des enormen finanziellen und zeitlichen
Aufwands fuer den Unterricht nicht alle, die das Ausbildungssystem
durchlaufen, auch gebildet sein werden.

Der neue pragmatische Kontext braucht andere Erziehungs- und
Ausbildungsziele: das Erkennen von Beziehungen und Zusammenhaengen in
einer sehr dynamischen Welt, die Faehigkeit zu hinterfragen und in
Frage zu stellen, den Umgang mit einer Komplexitaet, die unsere
Lebenspraxis nachhaltig beeinflusst und den Umgang mit einem Kontinuum
von Werten.  Studenten wissen heute aus eigener Erfahrung, dass die
Sprache nicht zwangslaeufig auf Bestand und Universalitaet angelegt ist;
vermutlich ist es fuer viele ein Schock zu sehen, wie gut die grossen
"illiteraten" Gruppen unserer Bevoelkerung in die moderne Gesellschaft
eingebunden sind, wie sie funktionieren und gedeihen.  Ein grosser
Teil derer, die aus welchen Gruenden auch immer aus unserem
Ausbildungssystem herausgefallen sind, haben irgendwo im
Wirtschaftsleben der westlichen Laender einen Platz gefunden.  Im
Alphabetismus des Konsums sind sie durchaus zu Hause und erfuellen die
von ihnen erwartete Funktion des Konsumenten.


Viele Fragen

Die Industriegesellschaft als Vorlaeufer unseres heutigen
pragmatischen Lebensrahmens benoetigte Schriftkultur und Bildung, um
die Maschinen optimal nutzen zu koennen und die koerperliche und
geistige Leistungsfaehigkeit derer, die sie betrieben, zu bewahren.
Das Ergebnis rechtfertigte die Hoehe der Bildungsaufwendungen.  Ein
gut ausgebildeter Arbeiter, Arzt, Chemiker, Jurist, Geschaeftsmann
waren notwendige Voraussetzungen fuer den reibungslosen Ablauf der
Industriegesellschaft.  Man musste wissen, wie eine Maschine zu
betreiben war.  In aller Regel war die Betriebsdauer einer Maschine
laenger als das Leben ihres Betreibers.  Daher war das benoetigte
Wissen (Gesetze, medizinische Therapien, chemische Formeln) fest
umrissen und unterlag relativ geringen AEnderungen.  In der Regel
behielt ein Buch seine Gueltigkeit fuer Vater, Sohn und sogar Enkel.
Und was durch Schriftlichkeit nicht zu vermitteln war, wurde durch
beispielhaftes Handeln weitergegeben, in der Lehrlingsausbildung etwa,
von der die Technik enorm profitierte.  Das Bildungssystem brachte
gebildete Menschen hervor, und die Mitglieder der Gesellschaft waren
auf Beziehungen vorbereitet, ohne welche die Maschinen wenig oder
keinen Sinn machten.  Je komplexer diese Beziehungen wurden, desto
mehr Zeit musste fuer Bildung und Erziehung aufgewendet werden und
desto hoeher musste die Qualifikation derer sein, die das
Ausbildungssystem trugen.

Fuer diese Zwecke erfuellte das Ausbildungssystem als Vermittler des
notwendigen Wissens seine Aufgabe, es fuellte gewissermassen die leeren
Behaelter, die von wohlhabenden Familien in die Schulen und
Universitaeten geschickt wurden.  Die Industriegesellschaft schuf die
Produkte und zugleich den zunehmenden Bedarf nach ihnen.  Einigen mag
diese Erklaerung simplifizierend erscheinen, und sie koennten ihr
entgegenhalten, dass die Industriellen ja keine ausgebildeten oder
gebildeten Arbeiter brauchten.  Die Tatsache, dass ein grosser Teil der
Arbeit von Kindern oder Frauen geleistet wurde, koennte dieses
Gegenargument unterstuetzen.  Erst im Verlauf des 19. Jahrhunderts
nahmen sie (moeglicherweise unter dem Einfluss eines religioesen
Humanismus) die Kinder aus den Fabriken heraus und unterwiesen sie im
Lesen, um (wie es hiess) ihre Seelen zu erheben.  Schliesslich wurde
die Kinderarbeit auch durch entsprechende Gesetze verboten.  Aber als
dies geschah, hatte die Industrie bereits, was sie benoetigte: eine
relativ gut ausgebildete Arbeiterklasse und eine hohe Produktivitaet
der Beschaeftigten, die die verfuegbare Ausbildung optimal nutzten.
Unter den entsprechenden pragmatischen Voraussetzungen erwies sich
ein ausgebildeter Arbeiter als eine gute Investition.

Im Gegensatz zu den vielen philanthropischen Motiven, die fuer die
Entwicklung des Bildungssystems im 19. Jahrhundert angefuehrt werden,
bin ich der Meinung, dass die Industriegesellschaft zur optimalen
Ausnutzung ihres maschinellen Produktionspotentials den Bedarf fuer
das, was sie produzierte, schaffen musste.  Die ersten Produkte der
Industriegesellschaft sind mithin die Arbeiter selbst, die ihre
koerperlichen Merkmale und Faehigkeiten, vor allem aber solche
Faehigkeiten wie Verstehen, Interaktion und Koordination in die
maschinenbezogene Praxis hineinprojizierten.  Alle diese Merkmale
sind im uebrigen die Strukturmerkmale der Schriftkultur.

Die Industrieprodukte, die aus den qualitativ neuen Formen der
menschlichen Selbstkonstituierung hervorgingen, waren fuer die
Illiteraten von geringem Interesse.  Was sollte man mit
Schreibmaschinen, Buechern und aehnlichem Hausgeraet anfangen?  Wie
sollte jemand, der des Lesens und Schreibens nicht oder nicht
genuegend kundig war, aus diesen Produkten ein befriedigendes Ergebnis
herausholen koenne?  Und wie koennte eine Koordination mit anderen, die
solche Produkte verwendeten, stattfinden?  Natuerlich waren die
Grenzen niemals so scharf gezogen.  Nichtgebildete Eltern hatten
gebildete Kinder, die das notwendige Wissen aus der Schule
mitbrachten.  Dieses allmaehliche Durchsikkern von Bildung und
Schriftkultur gehoerte vermutlich sogar zur allgemeinen Strategie.
Alles in allem aber war die philanthropische Foerderung der Bildung
gleichbedeutend mit einer Investition in eine optimal funktionierende
Gesellschaft, deren Skala hocheffiziente Arbeitsebenen erforderlich
machte.  Es gibt durchaus eine philanthropische Motivierung fuer die
Foerderung von Bildung und Erziehung, und zwar als eine Form der
Verteilung des Reichtums.  Aber solche Foerderung ergibt sich nicht
nur aus reiner Naechstenliebe, sondern auch aus dem klaren Vorteil,
den man aus dem zur Verfuegung gestellten Geld, den gestifteten
Sachmitteln oder den Stiftungslehrstuehlen zieht.

Unser Bildungssystem als Ergebnis der Schriftkultur hat niemals so
recht verstanden, dass die Schriftkultur einem Entwicklungsstadium
entspricht, in dem Schriftsprache das Medium fuer die gesprochene
Sprache war.  Es hat allerdings begriffen, dass wir heute das
Gesprochene in nichtschriftlicher Form speichern koennen, und zwar
bisweilen effizienter als in der Schriftsprache und ohne die hohen
Aufwendungen, die fuer die Pflege von Schriftkultur und Bildung
notwendig sind.  Ob mit oder ohne die Hilfe von Philanthropie, das
Lernen muss sich heute von der Schriftkultur und deren beengenden
Strukturen befreien, so wie es sich vormals von der Kirche befreit
hat.  Wenn sich aber dieses neue Bewusstsein nur darin aeussert, dass die
Universitaeten Videobaender anstelle von gedruckten Katalogen versenden,
dann fragt man sich, ob die fuer die Erziehung Verantwortlichen oder
nur die Marktprofis die gegenwaertige Dynamik verstanden haben.  Das
Gleiche gilt fuer die Professoren, die im Glauben, dass Studenten
konserviertes Wissen leichter verinnerlichen, ihre Vorlesungen
inzwischen auf Videobaendern anbieten.  Online-Vorlesungen
durchbrechen zwar die alten Gewohnheiten, sind aber keine
ausreichende Antwort auf unsere neuen Probleme, jedenfalls nicht,
solange sie nicht in ein allgemeineres Verstaendnis von Bildung und
Ausbildung integriert sind, das neue Prioritaeten setzt und
angemessene Inhalte definiert.

Gegen die Verwendung neuer Medien in der Ausbildung ist ueberhaupt
nichts einzuwenden, aber das Speicher- und Vermittlungsmedium stellt
nicht das eigentliche Problem dar.  Medienlabors kuemmern vor sich hin,
da sie die gleichen nutzlosen Informationen anbieten wie die
Unterrichtsformen, die sie eigentlich ersetzen und verbessern sollten.
Auch das zeigt uns, wie noetig eine grundsaetzliche Veraenderung
unseres Systems waere.  Zu den fundamentalen Voraussetzungen des
derzeitigen Bildungssystems gehoert es z. B., dass das Wissen von
Professoren--die mehr wissen sollen--an Studenten--die weniger wissen
koennen--weitervermittelt wird.  In Wirklichkeit aber sehen wir uns
mit einer voellig neuen und veraenderten Wirklichkeit konfrontiert: In
manchen Bereichen wissen die Studenten heute mehr als ihre Lehrer.
Hinzu kommt, dass das Wissen, das noch vor kurzer Zeit in einem Fach
relevant gewesen sein mag--ob in Geschichte, Politikwissenschaft oder
Wirtschaft, oder aber in den Faechern, die sich mit den Kulturen der
ehemaligen Sowjetunion und Osteuropas befassen--mittlerweile veraltet
ist.  Physik, Mathematik und Chemie haben sich auf spektakulaere Weise
veraendert.  Die vorhandenen Lehrbuecher und das sogenannte Wissen
einiger Professoren sind von der Wirklichkeit laengst ueberholt worden.

Sollte sich die heutige Ausbildung an den Nachrichtenmedien
orientieren?  Sollten die Bildungseinrichtungen zu einer
Internetadresse fuer unbegrenztes und unstrukturiertes Browsing
werden?  Sollten Bildung und Ausbildung jegliche stabile Grundlage
aufgeben?  Oder sollten die Universitaeten nicht zumindest in
regelmaessigen Abstaenden ihren Zuschnitt so ueberdenken, dass sie die
neuesten Theorien, die neuesten Forschungstechniken und die neuesten
Erfindungen problemlos in ihre Curricula einbauen koennen?  Alle diese
Fragen draengen sich denen auf, die noch immer ein Wort nach dem
anderen schreiben und eine Frage nach der anderen beantworten.  Aber
wenn wir diese Fragen, auf die ich am Ende dieses Buches einige
Antworten zu geben versuche, nicht stellen, koennen wir keine Loesungen
erwarten.  Wenn sich alle, die fuer unser Bildungssystem
verantwortlich sind, und alle, die von ihm in irgendeiner Weise
betroffen sind, diese und weitere Fragen stellen wuerden, dann koennten
wir uns vielleicht auf angemessene Weise mit einem Problem befassen,
fuer dessen Loesung es keine allumfassende Zauberformel geben kann.
Dass dies geschieht, zeichnet sich mittlerweile allerdings in vielen
Teilen unserer Welt ab.  Endlich!


Eine Kompromissformel

Da in unserer Selbstkonstituierung die Schriftkultur nur noch eines
von vielen Medien fuer die von der neuen Skala geforderte Effizienz
ist, begreifen wir allmaehlich, dass wir uns Schriftkultur und Bildung
nicht mehr in dem Masse leisten koennen, wie wir es bislang getan haben.
Und selbst wenn wir es koennten, sollten wir es nicht tun.
Allmaehlich setzt sich die Erkenntnis durch, dass die schriftkulturelle
Maschinerie, die wir merkwuerdigerweise noch immer Erziehung oder
Bildung nennen, die nachwachsenden Generationen nur noch bedingt auf
das Leben vorbereitet.  Die Bildungsperspektiven stehen dabei in
permanentem Widerspruch zu den sich rasant veraendernden menschlichen
Erfahrungen, durch die wir das werden, was wir sind.  Eine am
Paradigma der Schriftkultur orientierte Erziehung ist, wie wir
gesehen haben, ein Luxus geworden, den sich keine Gesellschaft, ob
reich oder arm, mehr leisten kann.  Die im Verlauf der Erziehung
erworbenen Faehigkeiten und die Perspektiven, die wir fuer unser Leben
aus der Bildung beziehen, muessen heute als Zusammenhang betrachtet
und als eine niemals endgueltig abgeschlossene Serie von
Ausbildungsschritten konzipiert werden.  Die Nuetzlichkeit der
jeweiligen Ausbildung wird vermutlich zeitlich sehr begrenzt sein,
die aufeinanderfolgenden Ausbildungsabschnitte moeglicherweise nicht
nahtlos auseinander hervorgehen.

Niemand wird die Bedeutung eines Sprachenstudiums ernsthaft in Frage
stellen, aber nur wenige sind willens, das Sprachenstudium oder das
Studium von Faechern, die auf einem Sprachenstudium basieren, als
Voraussetzung fuer eine Serie von verschiedenen Berufstaetigkeiten
anzusehen, denen die heutigen Studenten im Laufe ihres Lebens werden
nachgehen muessen.  Noch immer ist die gehobene Schulausbildung (also
etwa die Sekundarstufe 2 an deutschen Gymnasien) und ein grosser Teil
des Universitaetsstudiums auf Sprachen und Geisteswissenschaften
ausgerichtet; niemand nimmt die offenkundige Verlagerung von diesen
Bereichen auf die Sprachen der Mathematik--die heute eine extrem
diversifizierte Wissenschaftsdisziplin geworden ist--und der
visuellen Darstellung zur Kenntnis und ist bereit, daraus die
entsprechenden curricularen Konsequenzen zu ziehen.  Die Mathematik
bereitet heute auf die Vielzahl der zukunftsweisenden Berufsfelder
vor, im Bereich der Technik und des Managements, der
Naturwissenschaft und Philosophie, des Designs und der Rechtsprechung.
Rechnen ist zuallererst eine Sprache, und Ziel jeder Erziehung
muesste die fluessige Beherrschung dieser Sprache sein.  Das Gleiche
gilt fuer alle Bereiche, die mit Visualisierung zu tun haben: Zeichnen,
Computergraphik, Design.  Das Studium der visuellen Techniken und
Ausdrucksformen ist heute mindestens so wichtig wie das Studium
sprachbezogener Gegenstaende.

Vor diesem Hintergrund muss sich unser Bildungssystem neu definieren.
Vor allem muss das "Containermodell"--das Kind als leerer Container,
das mit Sprachen, Geschichte, Mathematik und leider nicht sehr viel
mehr angefuellt wird--durch ein heuristisches Erziehungsmodell ersetzt
werden.  Wie die Pragmatik unseres Lebens muss auch die Pragmatik der
Bildung prozesshaften Charakter gewinnen.  Sie muss zu Interaktion
faehig sein und zur Herausbildung von Kriterien, die die Wahl zwischen
zahlreichen Optionen erleichtern.  Manche Paedagogen verbraemen die
traditionellen Erziehungsmodelle mit neuen Begriffen, wenn sie die
vermeintlich neuen Erziehungsideale umschreiben als "Erziehung zum
Denken".  Studenten denken ohnehin, ob wir sie dazu erziehen oder
nicht!  Und heute stellen sich die Studenten besser auf die ihnen
bewussten Veraenderungen und die daraus sich notwendig ergebenden
Interaktionsformen ein, auch auf Interaktionen mit Technologie, als
ihre Lehrer.  Die Mehrzahl der neuen jungen Unternehmen im Internet
geht aus diesen studentischen Kreisen hervor und ist auf deren
Erfindungsgeist und Hingabe zurueckzufuehren.  Interessanterweise sind
die Studierenden trotz der dargestellten Misere des Bildungssystems
zu den wesentlichen Betreibern der Veraenderungen geworden.  Sie sind
oftmals ihre eigenen Erzieher und schaffen das Umfeld, in dem sie
ihre Erfahrungen weitervermitteln.


Kindheit

Niemand kann ernsthaft ueber die Verbesserung von Bildungssystemen
nachdenken, ohne sich die tatsaechliche Situation eines Kindes zu
vergegenwaertigen.  In unserer heutigen durch Freiheit, Fluechtigkeit
und fast grenzenlose Mobilitaet gekennzeichneten Welt kommen immer
mehr Kinder aus Familien mit einem alleinerziehenden Elternteil.
Viele Kinder unterliegen Umwelteinfluessen, die durch Diskriminierung,
Armut, Vorurteil und Gewalt gekennzeichnet sind.  Auch diese Umstaende
charakterisieren eine Gesellschaft, die sich demokratischen Idealen
verschrieben hat.  Wir muessen einfach in Rechnung stellen, dass die
Erziehung und Ausbildung von Kindern zunehmend von der Familie auf
Institutionen uebergeht, die eine erzogene oder ausgebildete Person
produzieren.  Die Gesellschaft hat aus den allerbesten Motiven heraus
Fabriken fuer die Bearbeitung (im Sinne von processing) von Kindern
geschaffen.  Viele Menschen uebertragen ihre eigene persoenliche
Erziehungsverantwortung nicht ungern auf diese sozio-paedagogischen
Einrichtungen, die nach dem Prinzip handeln: "Alles ist in Ordnung,
wenn die Kinder wie ihre Eltern erzogen werden."

Obwohl wir wissen, dass die Zyklen unseres Lebens (der Produktion, des
Designs, der Evaluierung) immer kuerzer werden, halten wir unsere
Kinder so lange in den Ausbildungsgaengen fest, dass sie nicht mehr auf
die Stuehle in den Klassenraeumen passen.  Und diese Erwachsenen,
voller Energie und voller Frustration darueber, dass nicht ihre
kreative Leistungsfaehigkeit, sondern ihre Geduld einer Pruefung
unterzogen wird, geben ein armseliges Bild ab.  Jemand, der heute die
Schule oder die Universitaet vorzeitig verlaesst, beweist nicht
unbedingt geistige Unreife.  Der Anspruch der Gesellschaft, auch fuer
die nachwachsenden Generationen zu bestimmen, was fuer deren Zukunft
das Beste ist, fuehrt zur Festlegung auf einen einzigen Ausbildungstyp
und ein bestimmtes Erziehungsideal.  Noch immer weigert sich die
Gesellschaft anzuerkennen, dass die Menschen ein vielfaeltiges
Leistungspotential aufweisen, das in ebenso vielfaeltigen
Erziehungsidealen zum Ausdruck kommen muesste.  Moeglicherweise sind die
hohen Abbruchquoten nur ein Anzeichen dafuer, dass die Ausbildungswege
fuer viele Leistungsprofile unangemessen sind und die Dauer der
Ausbildung insgesamt viel zu lang ist.

Ein Bildungsumfeld, das durch Flexibilitaet und neue Herausforderungen
gekennzeichnet ist, zahlt sich auf lange Sicht vermutlich aus.
Dennoch ist die Situation fuer die heutige junge Generation nicht
einfach.  Der Leistungsdruck, die starke Konkurrenz, der jugendliche
Drang nach Neuem und die Suche nach einem Platz in der Welt koennen
das Leben eines jungen Menschen schlagartig veraendern.  Auch ist im
Gegensatz zu frueheren Generationen der Weg zwischen Paradies (einem
sorgenfreien Leben mit vielen Wahlmoeglichkeiten) und Hoelle (dem
ganzen Spektrum von Krankheiten, Sucht und Abhaengigkeit, Einsamkeit,
Enttaeuschung, Orientierungslosigkeit) heute zu einer schmalen
Gratwanderung geworden.  Ebenso koennen die vielfaeltigen Moeglichkeiten,
zwischen denen junge Menschen waehlen koennen--Hunderte von
Fernsehkanaelen, das Internet, Tausende von Musiktiteln (auf CD, Video
oder im Radio), Verlockungen von Sport, Drogen, Sex und Hunderten von
modischen Firmenmarken--zu einem Alptraum werden.  Die Schriftkultur
hatte das Leben ordentlich durchorganisiert.  War man verliebt, war
Romeo und Julia die richtige Lektuere.  Wollte man nach Griechenland
fahren, begann man mit den Homerischen Epen und ergaenzte sie durch
den Roman eines zeitgenoessischen Schriftstellers.

Drogen und AIDS, Millionen von Verlockungen, der Zwang, seinen
eigenen Raum in einer weniger stabilen und auch ungeduldigeren Welt
zu finden, passen indes nicht mehr in das ordentliche Schema einer
schriftkulturell strukturierten Welt.  Die Sprache der Genetik und
die Sprache der Persoenlichkeitsentfaltung haben heute bessere und
andere Artikulationsmoeglichkeiten.  Helden, Eltern, Lehrer, Priester
und Aktivisten fungieren nicht mehr fraglos als sinngebende Ikonen,
selbst wenn sie in den Darstellungen besser wegkommen, als sie in
Wirklichkeit sind.

Dennoch besuchen viele junge Menschen voller Enthusiasmus und
Hoffnung auf eine gute Ausbildung und Selbsterfuellung die Schulen und
Universitaeten.  Aber was heute mit grossem zeitlichen Aufwand und
unter grossen finanziellen Opfern gelernt wird, hat nur wenig mit dem
zu tun, was die spaetere Berufswelt von ihnen verlangt.  Sie lernen
schreiben, lesen und rechnen und muessen erfahren, dass im wirklichen
Leben ganz andere Faehigkeiten gefragt sind.  Eine schlimmere
Erfahrung kann es kaum geben als die, dass jahrelanger Fleiss sich
schliesslich doch nicht auszahlt.  Wir koennen nicht beides
gleichzeitig haben, traditionelle Bildung und die dazugehoerige
Schriftkultur einerseits und andererseits Berufsqualifikationen, die
auf der Grundlage von Schriftkultur und Bildung nicht nur nicht zu
erwerben sind, sondern von ihr geradezu verhindert werden.  Die
gegenwaertige Situation ist mithin durch einen Kompromiss
gekennzeichnet: zwischen den Interessen von traditionellen
Bildungsinstitutionen (und Abertausenden von Lehrern, die arbeitslos
wuerden) und einem neuen pragmatischen Handlungsrahmen, den nur wenige
Vertreter der akademischen Welt wirklich verstehen.

Ein wichtiges Element dieser Kompromissformel besteht darin, dass wir
die Ausbildung auf einer moeglichst kontinuierlicher Grundlage fuer
alle oeffnen.  Aber wir werden nur unbefriedigende Ergebnisse erzielen,
wenn wir sie nicht auf die Vielfalt von Bildungsformen und
Literalitaeten ausrichten.  Die Vielfalt der heutigen Lebenspraxis
macht es erforderlich, dass wir verschiedene Kreativitaetstypen
anerkennen, die notwendigen Ausbildungsgaenge fuer sie schaffen und zu
einem integrierten Bildungsangebot finden.  Vor allem aber muessen wir
Weiterbildungsmassnahmen treffen.  Gerade sie gehoeren zum wesentlichen
Bestandteil jener gegenseitigen Verpflichtungen, durch die unsere
neue Lebenspraxis anerkannt wird.

Denen, die sich den menschlichen Aspekten von Politik, Geschaeftsleben,
Recht und Medizin verpflichtet fuehlen und die darueber klagen, dass
die Techniker der politischen Entscheidungsprozesse nicht mehr den
Weg zu den Herzen der Menschen finden, mag dies als eine
Schreckensvision erscheinen.  Wir alle verfolgen ein Ideal von
Individualitaet, das uns durch persoenliche Wuerde, durch eigene
Persoenlichkeitsmerkmale, UEberzeugungen, Emotionen und Schmerzen von
anderen unterscheidet.  Aber wir selbst unterminieren unsere
Erwartungen, indem wir immer mehr fuer immer weniger Geld verlangen
und nicht einmal den Preis zu zahlen bereit sind, den die
Gesellschaft aufwenden muss, um uns zu dieser Individualitaet zu
verhelfen.  Unsere derzeitige Skala noetigt uns Anonymitaet, vermutlich
auch Mediokritaet auf.  Es ist Zeit, dass wir uns von den in der
Schriftkultur festgeschriebenen Erwartungen loesen, denn diese haben
keinen Bezug mehr zu unserer neuen Pragmatik.

Ein Kompromiss zwischen den alten Bildungsformen und den neuen
Beduerfnissen sieht oft so aus, dass wir die traditionellen
Bildungswege und Bildungsinhalte um neue Teilbereiche aus den
vielfaeltigen partiellen Literalitaeten ergaenzen.  Das macht dann aus
unserem Bildungssystem eine Art Verpackungsindustrie fuer Menschen:
Man waehlt den Verarbeitungstyp, dem man sich unterwerfen moechte,
bekommt ein allgemeines schriftkulturelles Alibi und darueber hinaus
eine zusaetzliche berufsbezogene Ausbildung fuer sogenannte
Eingangsstufenjobs.

Die Parameter, nach denen sich dieser Wirtschaftszweig zur
Verarbeitung nachwachsender Generationen richtet, ergeben sich aus
der opportunistischen Suche nach einem Platz irgendwo zwischen der
akademischen Welt und der Wirklichkeit.  Analog zur allgemeinen
Arbeitsteilung auf dem Berufsmarkt haben sich auch im
Wissenschaftsbereich sehr enge Bereiche herauskristallisiert, in
denen die jeweils wissenschaftliche Expertise erworben werden kann;
das schlaegt sich in den Strukturen der Ausbildungsstaetten nieder,
ohne dass allerdings die kuenstliche Distanz zur Wirklichkeit und der
dort erwarteten Effizienz ueberbrueckt wird.  Die akademische Welt geht
nur selten Verpflichtungen gegenueber ihren Absolventen ein.
Entsprechend tief ist die Kluft zwischen ihrer Sprache und den
Sprachen der gegenwaertigen Lebenspraxis.  Der Beamtenstatus bzw. die
lebenslange Anstellung von Hochschullehrern traegt zur Verkrustung
dieser Strukturen bei.  Und wenn das hoechste Ziel eines angesehenen
Professors darin liegt, von seiner Lehrverpflichtung befreit zu
werden, dann kann irgend etwas nicht mehr stimmen mit der Freiheit,
die wir den Professoren zur Ausuebung ihrer Taetigkeit einraeumen.

Haeufig spiegeln auch die Pruefungsstrukturen diese Misere wider.  Die
in den Vereinigten Staaten weitverbreiteten Testverfahren zur
Leistungsueberpruefung von Studierenden gruenden auf einer Dichotomie,
die den Studenten dazu anleitet, auf bestimmte Fragen zu reagieren,
statt ihn in seiner kreativen Leistungsfaehigkeit zu foerdern.  Also
werden--auch in den Erwartungen der Studierenden--Lehre und Lernen
auf das Abschlussexamen abgestellt, nicht auf den Gegenstand.  Kein
Wunder, dass die wirklich guten Studenten frustriert sind und das
Gefuehl haben, sich nicht entfalten zu koennen.  Die kreative Neugier,
die mit 14 Jahren noch gut ausgebildet war, wird durch die
buerokratischen Tests eher abgestumpft, die im uebrigen meist nur wegen
ihrer niedrigen Kosten durchgefuehrt werden.  Dennoch wirken sie sich
nachhaltig auf die Strukturen der Lehre und des Lernens aus.  Die
eigentlichen Schluesselaktivitaeten--sich auf neue Situationen
einstellen zu koennen und sie kreativ vorherzusehen--werden indes
durch solche Strukturen konterkariert.

Die geringste Lehrqualitaet findet sich heute im Grundstudium der
Universitaet, welches weitgehend von Assistenten und Lehrpersonen
vergleichbaren Status’ durchgefuehrt wird, waehrend die Professoren
ihre Zeit darauf verwenden, Drittmittel fuer ihre Forschung anzuwerben.
Auch diese Tatsache ist darauf zurueckzufuehren, dass wir bislang
weder willens noch in der Lage waren, unsere Bildungsstrukturen an
die neuen Lebensumstaende anzupassen, die einen von uns selbst
verursachten Bedarf an erhoehter Effizienz beinhalten.  Im uebrigen
traegt auch die alleinige Orientierung an den Abschlusszensuren als
Leistungsindikator zur Beibehaltung der Unterrichtsstrukturen bei.
Denn damit wird gerade das, was die Qualitaet der Ausbildung negativ
beeinflusst, zum einzigen Massstab gemacht.  Es ist daher wohl kein
Zufall, dass das in den Vereinigten Staaten am meisten nachgefragte
Buch ueber die Universitaeten--die heutigen Erziehungsfabriken--eine
Anleitung zum erfolgreichen Taeuschen in Pruefungen ist.

In den vergangenen Jahren hat man verschiedentlich die
Bildungssysteme der Vereinigten Staaten und Japans oder
westeuropaeischer Laender und die jeweiligen Absolventenleistungen
miteinander verglichen.  Dabei traten einige bemerkenswerte
Erkenntnisse zutage.  So verbringen die japanischen Studierenden etwa
genausoviel Zeit vor dem Fernsehapparat wie die amerikanischen
Studenten, hingegen wird unterschiedlich viel Zeit fuer die Lektuere
aufgebracht.  Japaner lesen doppelt soviel wie amerikanische
Studenten, Japaner verwenden auch etwa die doppelte Zeit fuer ihre
Vor- und Nachbereitung zu Hause, entsprechend weniger Zeit steht fuer
Unterhaltung zur Verfuegung.  Ist also Japan ein Modell fuer unser
Bildungssystem?  Wenn wir uns vergegenwaertigen, dass japanische
Studierende bei allen naturwissenschaftlichen Tests hervorragend
abschneiden, muesste die Antwort positiv ausfallen.  Wenn wir aber die
allgemeine Leistungsfaehigkeit, das kreative Potential, vergleichen,
ist die Lage schon etwas zurueckhaltender zu beurteilen und erklaert
teilweise die Japankrise.  Bei allen Nachteilen zeigt sich naemlich,
dass die Studierenden in den Vereinigten Staaten auf die pragmatischen
Erfordernisse der Berufswelt besser vorbereitet werden.  Das mag an
der Dynamik des Landes, nicht unbedingt am Bildungssystem liegen.
Insgesamt gilt doch wohl, dass die relative Freiheit von Regulierungen,
die Faehigkeit, sich an veraenderte Situationen anzupassen, und die
Innovationsbereitschaft die Vereinigten Staaten flexibler machen fuer
die Bildungsmoeglichkeiten, die sich uns heute bieten.

Der Preis, den die Vereinigten Staaten fuer den Bildungskompromiss zu
zahlen haben, ist allerdings sehr hoch.  Als japanische Unternehmen
damit begannen, die ersten amerikanischen Universitaeten aufzukaufen
und damit vor dem Bankrott zu retten, wurde die Hoehe dieses Preises
allen deutlich.  Die amerikanischen Universitaeten konnten auf diese
Weise der Rigiditaet ihres eigenen Bildungssystems entgehen, welches
anerkanntermassen am wenigsten geeignet war, sich auf diese veraenderte
Dynamik einzustellen.  Urploetzlich wurde die weltweite
Amerikanisierung durch eine Japanisierung ersetzt.  Doch bei
genauerem Hinsehen erweist sich wohl auch hier, dass Japan versucht,
sich von den drastischen Anforderungen einer Schriftkultur zu
befreien, die innerhalb des traditionellen japanischen Wertesystems
die notwendige Anpassung an die neue Zeit nachhaltig behindert.
Natuerlich ist mangels ausreichender Kenntnisse des japanischen
Bildungssystems bei solchen Beurteilungen Vorsicht geboten, dennoch
zeichnet sich ein entsprechender Trend ab.  Die Folgen dieses Trends
sind selbstredend.


Welche Alternativen?

Bevor wir uns mit Alternativen beschaeftigen, sollten wir uns
vergegenwaertigen, dass wir mit den gegebenen technischen Moeglichkeiten
jede Information und jeden Informationstyp an jede denkbare Adresse
vermitteln koennen.  Im Gegensatz zur global agierenden Wirtschaft und
der Vernetzung von Geschaeften und Maerkten fuehren unsere Schulen und
Universitaeten inhaltlich und organisatorisch ein Leben jenseits der
Wirklichkeit; sie sind fast so anachronistisch wie die Schloesser und
Palaeste, die wir heute mit der Macht und den Aufgaben des Adels
assoziieren, bzw. so anachronistisch, wie heute die riesigen
Stahlfabriken als Sinnbild fuer Industrie oder die Staedte als Sinnbild
fuer gesellschaftliches Leben.  Fuer die Aufrechterhaltung ausgedienter
Strukturen und Haltungen und fuer Investitionen in feudale
Universitaetsstrukturen gibt es keine Rechtfertigung mehr.  Statt
dessen muessen wir unser Augenmerk auf die Dynamik individueller
Selbstkonstituierung und auf den pragmatischen Horizont unserer aller
Zukunft legen.

Das alte Bildungssystem in den Vereinigten Staaten oder irgendwo
anders auf der Welt zu reformieren und auszubauen wuerde mehr kosten,
als ein neues aufzubauen.  In einem solchen neuen Bildungssystem
muesste ein angemessenes Klima und muessten angemessene Strukturen fuer
Interaktionen geschaffen werden, die die Fortschritte in den
Kommunikationstechnologien und im interaktiven Lernen in vollem
Umfang nutzen.  Dafuer muessen wir gar nicht das Internet oder das
World Wide Web idealisieren.  Aber wenn unsere Zukunft zunehmend
durch kommerzielle Erwartungen und weniger durch paedagogische
Beduerfnisse bestimmt wird, dann sollte sich niemand ueberrascht zeigen,
wenn das erzieherische Potential der paedagogischen Beduerfnisse erst
spaet Fruechte traegt.

Menschen bringen unterschiedliche Begabungen mit und entwickeln sich
daher mit unterschiedlicher Geschwindigkeit und in verschiedene
Richtungen.  Die Unterschiede zwischen jedem Einzelnen von uns sind
so gross, dass die Hauptaufgabe der Erziehung nicht darin bestehen kann,
aufgrund eines falschen Demokratieverstaendnisses Unterschiede
einzuebnen, sondern sie vielmehr zu betonen und zu verstaerken.  Nur
dies gibt einem Jedem die Chance, sich gemaess seiner eigenen
Moeglichkeiten zu entwickeln.  Die Inhalte unserer Erziehung und
Bildung, welche wir als einen immerwaehrenden Prozess auffassen sollten,
muessen die menschliche Erfahrung und die Mittel sein, diese
Erfahrung zu schaffen und zu verstehen.  An die Stelle der einen
beherrschenden Sprache mit den ihr eingebauten Erwartungen, welche
der Mehrheit der Studenten zunehmend als weltfremd erscheinen, muss
die Faehigkeit treten, mit vielen unterschiedlichen Zeichensystemen,
mit vielen Sprachen umzugehen, sich in ihnen auszudruecken, sie an die
jeweiligen Umstaende anzupassen und darauf anzuwenden und diese
Erfahrung mit anderen zu teilen.  Nun koennte man dem entgegenhalten,
dass man das vor nicht allzu langer Zeit mit der modernen Mathematik
versucht hat, mit dem Ergebnis, dass niemand die moderne Mathematik
verstanden hat und gleichzeitig die Kenntnisse in der traditionellen
Mathematik zurueckgegangen sind.  Darin liegt gewiss etwas Wahres.
Richtig aber ist, dass die mathematisch begabten Schueler keine
Probleme mit der neuen Mathematik hatten.  Nur diejenigen, die unter
dem Einfluss schriftkulturellen Denkens standen, hatten mit Problemen
zu kaempfen.  Ohne hier auf Einzelheiten eingehen zu koennen, ist doch
das Grundbeduerfnis klar: Wir muessen den Geist offen halten, soviel
Wissen wie moeglich akkumulieren, aber uns auch von nutzlosem Ballast
trennen koennen, sofern neue Erfahrungen eine OEffnung fuer neue Inhalte
und eine Losloesung von Althergebrachtem verlangen.  Einige Studenten
werden sich (in der Mathematik und in verwandten Faechern) vornehmlich
auf visuelle Zeichensysteme konzentrieren, andere auf Laute und
Klaenge, wieder andere auf Woerter, auf Rhythmen oder auf irgendeine
der Formen, in denen sich menschliche Intelligenz ausdrueckt.  Die
interaktiven Multimedien sind nur einige der verfuegbaren Medien.
Andere Moeglichkeiten zeichnen sich ab.  Das Gleiche gilt fuer das
Internet.  Wir brauchen einen allgemeinen Rahmen, in dem sich jeder
Einzelne nach seinen individuellen Beduerfnissen die Lernangebote
auswaehlt und sie in dem Masse verfolgt, wie seine eigene Lebens- und
Berufspraxis dies erfordert und anerkennt.  Dafuer reicht
Schriftkultur und schriftkulturelle Bildung laengst nicht mehr aus.
Hinzutreten muessen mathematische Bildung, biologische, chemische,
technische Literalitaet, ebenso wie das visuelle Denken und der
visuelle Ausdruck.  Entscheidend wird auch die Verknuepfung zwischen
solchen Faechern werden, die traditionellerweise ein isoliertes Dasein
fuehrten.  In dieser interdisziplinaeren Verknuepfung liegt ein enormes
Kreativitaetspotential.

Die atomistische Betreibung isolierter Unterrichtsgegenstaende muss
einer ganzheitlichen Perspektive weichen, die die einzelnen Faecher
zur Totalitaet der Wirklichkeit und damit zueinander in Beziehung
bringt.  Effektive Instrumente der Vermittlung zwischen diesen
einzelnen Bereichen wird die Effizienz der Arbeit erhoehen, die
notwendige Integration bewerkstelligen und zwischen den
arbeitsteiligen Wissensformen unserer praktischen Erfahrungen
vermitteln.  Im Zentrum unserer Bildungserfahrungen muss die
Zusammenarbeit stehen, die sich an gemeinsamen Interessens- und
Erfahrungsbereichen zu bewaehren hat.  Erziehung und Bildung muessen
darauf abzielen, solche Erfahrungen auszutauschen und zu teilen.
Gemeinsames kollaboratives Lernen kann die Vielfalt unterschiedlicher
Interessen zu einem Brennpunkt vereinen.  Dieser Ansatz weist viele
Dimensionen auf: das gemeinsam gesuchte Wissen, die Erfahrung von der
Vielfalt der Perspektiven und Anwendungen, das Bewusstsein von
Interaktion, die Faehigkeiten zur Interkommunikation und vieles mehr.
Die nach wie vor entscheidende Motivation fuer individuelle Leistung
und individuellen Lohn wird ergaenzt durch die kollaborative Erfahrung
des gemeinsamen effizienten Strebens nach Leistung und Erkenntnis.
In einer Zeit, in der die Begrenztheit der Ressourcen offenkundig
wird und die Erwartungen dennoch exponentiell ansteigen, sind solche
Erziehungsformen lebenswichtig.  Dieses neue Bildungsmodell, das
Individualitaet und Differenz in die kollaborative Erfahrung einbindet,
wuerde im uebrigen einen neuen ethischen Rahmen schaffen, den wir
heute dringend benoetigen.  Darin waere Konkurrenz keineswegs
ausgeschlossen, aber an die Stelle des Konfliktes--der sich heute
darin aeussert, dass Studenten Seiten aus den Lehrbuechern herausreissen,
damit ihre Kommilitonen benachteiligt sind--koennte ein allgemeines
Klima der Kooperation zum gegenseitigen Vorteil treten.  Wie weit
sind wir von diesem Ziel entfernt?

Jacques Barzun, ganz gewiss ein Verfechter schriftkultureller Bildung,
hat unserem Ausbildungssystem vorgehalten, dass es "natuerliche
Intelligenz nicht ausreichend" entwickele: "Wir wollten den idealen
Buerger, den toleranten Nachbarn, das Engagement fuer den weltweiten
Frieden, heile Familien mit gluecklichen Familienmitgliedern schaffen,
die im Sexual- und im Autoverkehr gleichermassen erfahren sind."
Daran ist natuerlich ueberhaupt nichts auszusetzen, aber als
Erziehungsziele gehen sie doch am Wesentlichen vorbei.
Buergerlichkeit bedeutet in der heutigen Gesellschaft etwas anderes
als frueher.  Toleranz muss sich heute auf eine andere Weise als frueher
zeigen, z. B. in der Anerkennung und Integration von Alteritaet und
Komplementaritaet.  Ja, und auch Frieden bedeutet heute angesichts der
vielen lokalen Konfliktherde ueberall auf der Welt etwas anderes.  Und
was Familie, Sexualitaet und Autokultur betrifft, so duerfte hier
unsere Erziehung am deutlichsten versagt haben.  Die Faktoren, die
das zeitgenoessische Familienleben ausmachen, finden in unseren
Bildungsangeboten kaum Beachtung.  Mit der Sexualitaet steht es nicht
besser.  Auf die Degradierung der Sexualbeziehungen hat unser
Bildungssystem keine bessere Antwort zu bieten als die kostenlose
Verteilung von Kondomen an den Schulen, was dann grossartig
Sexualerziehung genannt wird.  Und die versierten Autofahrer haben
offenbar niemals die kritischen Stimmen gehoert, die sich ueber die
Energieverschwendung Gedanken machen.  Mit Wohlwollen betrachten wir,
wie viele Schueler und Studenten mit eigenen Autos oder den Autos
ihrer Eltern zur Schule oder zur Universitaet fahren, statt zu
begreifen, dass auch die Ausbildung dezentralisiert werden und--warum
denn nicht--die heutigen Moeglichkeiten der Kommunikation und
Interaktion besser genutzt werden muessten.  Die jugendlichen Anhaenger
der Gruenen, die sich heute gegen den Energieverbrauch stark machen,
sind vermutlich dem Erziehungssystem weit voraus, muessen es aber
dennoch durchlaufen.  Und schliesslich muesste unsere Erziehung auch die
anderen Veraenderungen zur Kenntnis nehmen, die mit dem Ende der
Schriftkultur einhergehen, die Veraenderungen im Status der Familie,
der Religion, der Rechtsprechung und des Regierungssystems.

Erziehung und Bildung werden unveraendert auf den buergerlichen Status
des Individuums bezogen bleiben, aber die neuen Bedingungen fuer die
Taetigkeit unseres Verstandes duerfen dabei nicht ausser acht gelassen
werden.  Im Idealfall tragen Bildung und Erziehung allen Facetten des
menschlichen Daseins Rechnung.  Die neuen Bedingungen der allgemeinen
Verknuepfung veraendern das Paradigma der Weiterbildung zu einem
Paradigma der niemals endenden, fortlaufenden Bildung, die den
anhaltenden Veraenderungen in unserer Erfahrung unter immer
komplexeren Umstaenden entspricht.  Es koennte durchaus sein, dass wir
fuer einige dieser Erfahrungen auf die Werte zurueckgreifen muessen, die
die Schriftkultur gekennzeichnet haben.  Aber es ist allemal besser,
sie neu zu entdecken, als das Ideal der Schriftkultur fraglos zu
verteidigen, wenn sich neue Perspektiven und neue Erfahrungen
abzeichnen, die viel, sehr viel mehr als nur Schriftkultur,
Schriftlichkeit und Bildung verlangen.
