COMPREHENSIBLE INPUT



    The best methods are therefore those that supply 'comprehensible input' in low anxiety situations, containing messages that students really want to hear. These methods do not force early production in the second language, but allow students to produce when they are 'ready', recognizing that improvement comes from supplying communicative and comprehensible input, and not from forcing and correcting production.

    In the real world, conversations with sympathetic native speakers who are willing to help the acquirer understand are very helpful.
    Stephen Krashen
